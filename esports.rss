<p>The last year of competitive <i>Magic</i> has been like many before it: unpredictable. As we navigated a busy field of online events and the leadup to <a href="https://magic.gg/events/magic-world-championship-xxviii" target="_blank"><i>Magic</i> World Championship XXVIII</a>, no one—including among our coverage insiders—saw <a href="https://magic.gg/news/the-week-that-was-the-greatest-steuer-ever-told" target="_blank">Nathan Steuer emerging as the best player at the World Championship</a> (though I have to say it wasn't long before it became clear what we were witnessing).</p>

<p>Steuer's victory at the <i>Magic</i> 30 festival was a taste of what's to come in 2023. It's almost a month out from <a href="https://mcphiladelphia.mtgfestivals.com/" target="_blank">MagicCon: Philadelphia</a>, and the atmosphere at the World Championship in Las Vegas was electric as more than 10,000 attended the event that played host to Steuer's run. We'll be running that back even bigger in Philadelphia as it serves as the major kickoff for the 2023 Pro Tour season, though we've actually been filling seats at the 2023 <i>Magic</i> World Championship for the last few months via the Regional Championships.</p>

<p>But I don't want to get too far ahead of myself. Let's back up a little bit and set the stage here. After all, in just a few weeks we'll hit the content cycle for Pro Tour <i>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</i> in Philladelphia and it'll be off to the races.</p>

<p>Let's take stock of where things stand on the path to the Pro Tour.</p>

<h1>What Would You Say You Do Around Here?</h1>

<p>Along with <a href="https://magic.gg/news/metagame-mentor-the-top-15-pioneer-decks-from-regional-championships" target="_blank">Frank Karsten and the Metagame Mentor column</a>, I'm back in 2023 with The Week That Was. <a href="https://magic.gg/news/the-week-that-was-with-a-cherryxman-on-top" target="_blank">As I wrote here</a> in my first weekly column, The Week That Was column years ago originally written by Brian David-Marshall was what hooked me on competitive <i>Magic.</i> I followed along every week for the latest format updates and stories of players who went from their local FNM and made a breakthrough at the next level. I could see that path for myself, and when my own breaks came later it was in part because I saw the ways it was possible.</p>

<p>We're almost six months into these columns and the time has flown. I think we've been able to recapture some of that feeling. To put it frankly, we've never had better metagame analysis than you'll find in Frank's columns, and I love that the weekly flow and rejuvenated tournament circuits around the world has given us a solid string of new and returning faces to competitive <i>Magic</i> to feature. You can expect more of the same in 2023 as The Week That Was returns to the Pro Tour.</p>

<h1>Looking Back</h1>

<p>Thanks to the regional format of the, well, Regional Championships, it's easy for players in one part of the world to miss updates from another since large, high-stakes tournaments have been happening all over, but we've actually been on quite the sprint over the past three months. We just wrapped the final Regional Championship in China to help set the field for the Pro Tour in Philadelphia and the World Championship at the end of the season. Throw in a handful of big online events and you have one of the busiest three-month stretches of high-level <i>Magic</i> we've seen in years.</p>

<p>Some numbers to put it in perspective.</p>

<ul>
	<li>2,900+ players competed in Regional Championships (that's <i>a lot</i> of Pioneer decklists!)</li>
	<li>162 invitations to Pro Tour <i>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</i></li>
	<li>13 invitations to <i>Magic</i> World Championship XXIX</li>
	<li>And at least former champion <a href="https://twitter.com/Mengu09/status/1594393239754113024" target="_blank">enjoying the ride</a></li>
</ul>

<p>All of that is a table-setter for what's to come this year. And while the particulars of high-level <i>Magic</i> have changed over the last few years, everyone who has competed in these Regional Championships has done so in pursuit of one simple goal—dream—that has driven players to shuffle up sixty since that first Pro Tour almost 30 years ago in New York.</p>

<p>Play <i>Magic</i>, see the world, win the Pro Tour.</p>

<p>Each of those 2,900-plus decklists isn't just a datapoint for a metagame calculator. They represent players like you and me who had a good run at Friday Night <i>Magic</i> or Game Day and wondered if we could take the next step. Each of those nearly 3,000 <i>Magic</i> players across the world moved from prereleases to FNM to Regional Championship qualifiers, and their dedication led them here and gave them the opportunity to fulfill those Pro Tour dreams.</p>

<p>Which brings me to Brandon Ortiz.</p>

<p>He's one of those players who has put the work in for years without a chance to shine. He first picked up <i>Magic</i> in 2009 and began playing competitive in 2016. For six years he worked to level up his game, moving through the ranks of his local scene on the way up through his region. His hard work culminated in a Regional Championship qualification, and he traveled along with 112 other players to Mexico City for The Gathering Showdown Series that served as the Regional Championship for Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean.</p>

<p>But he did a lot more than that.</p>

<p>I said qualifying for the Regional Championship was the culmination of Ortiz's work. Well, that was until the tournament started. Once it did, his unorthodox choice of Keruga Fires proved perfect for the late-season Pioneer metagame that had warped to beat Mono-Green Devotion and compete against Rakdos Midrange. He took the field by surprise and in fact ran into the <auto-card>Fires of Invention</auto-card> mirror in the finals against Alonso Mijares, where Ortiz accomplished something he has dreamed of for more than half a decade: a major title and an invitation to the World Championship.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Congratulations to both finalists, and to The Gathering Showdown Series champion Brandon Ortiz! <br><br>See you at Pro Tour I in Philly! <a href="https://t.co/AF739ffKQi">https://t.co/AF739ffKQi</a></p>&mdash; PlayMTG (@PlayMTG) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayMTG/status/1604631747731374080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 19, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>"I was very happy with my deck selection; my prediction worked," Ortiz explained. "I was expecting a lot of Rakdos and Mono-White, which I thought Keruga Fires had the tools to win fairly easily. I ended up beating four Rakdos Midrange decks and one Mono-White between the Swiss rounds and the Top 8 matches. After this, my goals for <i>Magic</i> in 2023 are to playing more competitive events to prepare for the Pro Tour and World Championship so I can have the best performance I possibly can."</p>

===decklistId:Keruga_Fires_Brandon_Ortiz_Regional_Championship_December 17, 2022_3f9788aa-7b68-4ae1-923b-d01886ad4336===

<p>Ortiz's victory gives him the exclamation point on his <i>Magic</i> resume, but it also revealed something about the Pioneer metagame that has become clear over the last few months: it's a lot more open than people initially perceived when fears of a <auto-card>Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx</auto-card>-dominated format abounded. Mono-Green Devotion proved defeatable, and it was a nice surprise to finish out 2022 with a pair of peripheral decks meeting in the finals of a big event. As Frank pointed out in his article, most of the decks in the format hovered near a 50% win rate, meaning that skill with a particular archetype was more important than any other edge possible.</p>

<h1>Looking Ahead</h1>

<p>Ortiz joins the dozen or so other players who have guaranteed themselves a seat at the World Championship later this year. You can start your own path to the Pro Tour with store-level RCQs; you can find tournaments on the <a href="https://locator.wizards.com/search?searchType=magic-events&amp;tag=regional_championship_qualifier&amp;query=Los%20Angeles,%20CA,%20USA&amp;distance=100&amp;page=1&amp;sort=date&amp;sortDirection=asc" target="_blank">Store and Event Locator</a> or your <a href="https://magic.gg/pro-tour?section=regional-championships#pro-tour" target="_blank">regional organizer's website</a>. RCQs through April 3, 2023 will feed into the third cycle of Regional Championships.</p>

<p>But first, the Pro Tour. I expect the hype level for <a href="https://mcphiladelphia.mtgfestivals.com" target="_blank">MagicCon: Philadelphia</a> Feb. 17-19 and the triumphant return of the paper PT and everything that comes with it at Pro Tour <i>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</i>. Personally, I'm looking forward to the first major international tabletop "Gathering" in three years featuring high-level tabletop competition.</p>

<p>One of the best parts of the Pro Tour circuit is the connections you make with diverse people across the world, and like everyone I've missed my friends from other places around the world. Philladelphia, here we come!</p>

<p>Just make sure you've seen <i>Rocky</i> before you show up.</p>

Today, we'll take a look at the top 15 Pioneer archetypes from the first cycle of Regional Championships and discuss what happened in these events. This can be your go-to resource to acquaint yourself with Pioneer (or Explorer) as you prepare for upcoming tournaments.</p>

<h1>The First Cycle of Regional Championships</h1>

<p>The first cycle of Regional Championships for the 2022-23 season took place in November and December of last year, inviting the best players from each region to compete for hundreds of thousands of dollars in prizes, 13 invitations to <i>Magic</i> World Championship XXIX, and 162 invitations to the <a href="https://mcphiladelphia.mtgfestivals.com/content/sitebuilder/rna/mtg-festivals/global/en-us/magiccon-news/magiccon-philadelphia-the-lineup.html" target="_blank">Pro Tour Phyrexia: All Is One</a>. These Regional Championships, held three times per year in each geographical region, are the new focal points for competitive play and offer a chance for players to qualify for the Pro Tour.</p>

<p>Over 2,900 players, mostly qualified through Regional Championship Qualifiers (RCQs) arranged by each regional organizer through local game stores, entered the various Regional Championships across the globe. They experienced the excitement of returning to in-person tournaments and high-stakes competition.</p>

<p>To provide an overview of all events, I collected their MTG Melee pages, which yield decklists, results, and standings for the Swiss rounds. For each region, the listed number of Pro Tour invites include the start-up bonus invitations that Wizards of the Coast awards for the 2022-23 season only:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Tournament/View/12649" target="_blank">U.S.A.</a> (48 Pro Tour invites)</li>
	<li><a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Tournament/View/12521" target="_blank">Europe/Middle East/Africa</a> (36 Pro Tour invites)</li>
	<li><a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Tournament/View/12349" target="_blank">Brazil</a> (8 Pro Tour invites)</li>

	<li><a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Tournament/View/13040" target="_blank">South America</a> (4 Pro Tour invites)</li>

	<li><a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Organization/View/2698" target="_blank">China</a> (4 Pro Tour invites)</li>
</ul>

<p>You can find Top 8 brackets, photos, and more in <a href="https://www.magic.gg/events/event-archive" target="_blank">our event coverage archive</a>. With more than 2,900 Regional Championship competitors in total, a lot of <auto-card>Teferi, Hero of Dominaria</auto-card> promo cards were handed out and a lot of Pioneer decklists are available to sink our teeth into. Let's crunch the numbers!</p>

<h1>The Pioneer Metagame</h1>

<p><a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/formats/pioneer" target="_blank">Pioneer</a> is a nonrotating format based on expansion sets and core sets from <i>Return to Ravnica</i> forward, and the most notable cards on <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/banned-restricted-list#pioneer-banned" target="_blank">the ban list</a> are the fetch lands. Using data from the Pioneer decklists submitted to the first cycle of 2022-23 Regional Championships, I determined the metagame share and non-mirror win rate of every archetype. While this analysis heavily weighs the results of the U.S. Regional Championship, which had an attendance of over 900 players, it accounts for developments from all regions.</p>

<p>In this table, each archetype name hyperlinks to a well-performing, representative decklist. The "Other" category included such deck archetypes as <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/255235">Bant Humans</a>, <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/256439">Grinning Ignus combo</a>, <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/256627">Azorius Spirits</a>, <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/263246">Elves</a>, <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/256822">Azorius Soldiers</a>, <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/255903">Orzhov Humans</a>, <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/255849">Selesnya Company</a>, <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/254797">Affinity</a>, <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/260934">Mardu Greasefang</a>, <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/260431">Bant Company</a>, <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/256872">Orzhov Midrange</a>, <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/262637">Jund Midrange</a>, <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/260915">Dimir Oracle</a>, and more.</p>

<p>The most-played nonland cards across all main decks and sideboards were <auto-card>Fable of the Mirror-Breaker</auto-card>, <auto-card>Bonecrusher Giant</auto-card>, <auto-card>Thoughtseize</auto-card>, <auto-card>Fatal Push</auto-card>, <auto-card>Llanowar Elves</auto-card>, and <auto-card>Elvish Mystic</auto-card>. These cards are considered staples of the format and can be found in a variety of decks.</p>

<p>The diverse metagame shows that there are many competitively viable options in Pioneer. In the hands of a skilled and experienced pilot, anything can win in Pioneer. Especially when all match win rates are close to 50-50, the pilot's familiarity with their deck and its play patterns can often be the deciding factor. As U.S. Regional Champion Matthew Saypoff pointed out, "Any deck can do well in Pioneer... so it's really a matter of picking a deck you like the play pattern of and can get really good at." South American Regional Champion Alejandro Sepúlveda echoed this sentiment, saying, "I think that experience can give me a greater edge than playing a better deck I don't know how to play."</p>

<h1>The Top 15 Pioneer Deck Archetypes</h1>

<p>To take a closer look at the 15 most popular archetypes from the Regional Championships, I've used a decklist aggregation algorithm that takes into account the popularity and performance of individual card choices. For each archetype, I've also included a matchup spread based on the Regional Championship round-by-round data, as well as tips for playing against the deck and a discussion of its viability in Explorer (the online true-to-tabletop format featuring all Pioneer-legal cards that appear on <i>MTG Arena</i>).</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Rakdos_Midrange____40ba645f-ea00-4f83-9afa-1be6f696b7e1===

<p><b>Quick deck summary:</b> Rakdos Midrange was the most popular archetype overall at the Regional Championships, comprising 17.1% of the metagame. The deck features efficient discard, powerful removal, resilient threats, and flexible sideboard options, giving it game against everything. The most important <i>Brothers' War</i> addition to Pioneer—<auto-card>Misery's Shadow</auto-card>—is included as a two-mana threat that prevents opposing death triggers and graveyard recursion.</p>

<p><b>Regional Championship story:</b> During the first weekend of Regional Championships, Rakdos Midrange was the second most popular deck, behind Mono-Green Devotion. However, as players discovered that <auto-card>Misery's Shadow</auto-card> evened the matchup against Mono-Green Devotion, Rakdos Midrange gained popularity and ended up winning as many as five Regional Championships! The victors were <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/256726" target="_blank">Pedro Mocelin</a> in Brazil, <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/258964" target="_blank">Rei Hirayama</a> in Japan, <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/258736" target="_blank">Anthony Lee</a> in Australia, <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/262184" target="_blank">Jim Tim Lee</a> in Taiwan, and <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/263093" target="_blank">Joseph Karani</a> in Western Canada. Rakdos Midrange will likely be the top deck to beat as we move towards the Pro Tour.</p>

<p><b>Matchup spread:</b> Rakdos Midrange has strong matchups against many decks, particularly those that are susceptible to removal, such as Boros Heroic and Bant Spirits. However, there are several archetypes that have a good matchup against Rakdos Midrange, including Gruul Vehicles, Keruga Fires, Rakdos Sacrifice, and Enigmatic Fires. These decks may see an increase in popularity in the coming weeks as players try to counter the dominance of Rakdos Midrange.</p>

<p><b>When facing this deck: </b>It's important to keep in mind that you should mulligan slightly less aggressively than might normally, as you'll need all the resources you can get. <auto-card>Thoughtseize</auto-card> and <auto-card>Dreadbore</auto-card> can disrupt your plans, and <auto-card>Kroxa, Titan of Death's Hunger</auto-card> can deprive you of further resources. Since you need raw cardboard, it's often better to keep a mediocre seven-card hand than a synergistic six-card hand against Rakdos Midrange.</p>

<p><b>Viability in Explorer</b>: On <i>MTG Arena</i>, <auto-card>Dreadbore</auto-card> and <auto-card>Urborg, Tomb of Yawgmoth</auto-card> are not available but they can be replaced by additional copies of <auto-card>Power Word Kill</auto-card> and a basic Swamp. As a result, Rakdos Midrange is also one of the most popular choices in Explorer.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Mono-Green_Devotion____f4d2563e-c04b-4803-bb39-d2652c01eb09===

<p><b>Quick deck summary</b>: Mono-Green Devotion, at 16.9% of the combined Regional Championship metagame, was the second-most popular archetype overall. The deck uses mana elves and <auto-card>Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx</auto-card> to potentially ramp into a turn-three <auto-card>Storm the Festival</auto-card>, which can even put <auto-card>Nicol Bolas, Dragon-God</auto-card> onto the battlefield. The inclusion of <auto-card>Karn, the Great Creator</auto-card>, along with <auto-card>The Stone Brain</auto-card>, <auto-card>Cityscape Leveler</auto-card>, and <auto-card>Haywire Mite</auto-card> from <i><auto-card>The Brothers' War</auto-card></i>, has made Mono-Green Devotion a formidable force.</p>

<p><b>Regional Championship story</b>: Mono-Green Devotion started as the most popular deck in the first Regional Championship weekend, where it helped propel <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/256119" target="_blank">Adrien Houssard</a> to a Top 8 in Europe and <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/254749" target="_blank">Eduardo Cesar</a> to a Top 8 in Brazil. However, as its overall win rate dropped below 50% and other players tuned their lists against Mono-Green Devotion, its popularity decreased in subsequent weekends. Despite this, Mono-Green Devotion remains a popular and important part of the Pioneer metagame, with players such as <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/260944" target="_blank">Christian Trudel</a> (winner of Eastern Canada Regionals), <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/260705" target="_blank">Michael van Vaals</a> (Top 8 in Eastern Canada), <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/259245" target="_blank">Shuhei Nakamura</a> (Top 8 in Japan), <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/260830" target="_blank">Dan Bretherton</a> and <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/260684" target="_blank">Daniel Riley</a> (both Top 8 in Australia), <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/263695" target="_blank">Chris Carlile</a>, and <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/263166" target="_blank">Dan Snider</a> (both Top 8 in Western Canada) finding success with the deck.</p>

<p><b>Matchup spread:</b> Mono-Green Devotion has a close matchup against Rakdos Midrange and a good matchup against decks like Rakdos Sacrifice and Keruga Fires, where it can go over the top. However, it struggles against decks with disruptive aggression, such as Mono-White Humans and Mono-Blue Spirits, which exploit its lack of creature removal and reliance on expensive spells.</p>

<p><b>When facing this deck</b>: It's important to be aware that the deck is capable of complex infinite loops. For example, <auto-card>Karn, the Great Creator</auto-card> can grab <auto-card>The Chain Veil</auto-card> and <auto-card>Pestilent Cauldron</auto-card> // <auto-card>Restorative Burst</auto-card> from the sideboard, allowing <auto-card>Kiora, Behemoth Beckoner</auto-card> to potentially untap <auto-card>Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx</auto-card> infinitely often. In tabletop events, it can be helpful to use pen and paper to track your opponent's mana pool, potential land drop for the turn, the number <auto-card>The Chain Veil</auto-card> activations, and the number of times <auto-card>Karn, the Great Creator</auto-card> and <auto-card>Kiora, Behemoth Beckoner</auto-card> have been activated, to help ensure that the game state remains clear and accurate.</p>

<p><b>Viability in Explorer</b>: On <i>MTG Arena</i>, Mono-Green Devotion lacks consistency due to the unavailability of <auto-card>Oath of Nissa</auto-card>, <auto-card>Sylvan Caryatid</auto-card>, and <auto-card>The Chain Veil</auto-card>. However, since the addition of Nykthos to Explorer via Explorer Anthology 2, Mono-Green Devotion has become one of the most popular archetypes in the format.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Izzet_Phoenix____fc28cea2-5632-47fb-b99f-937d1131d779===

<p><b>Quick deck summary</b>: Izzet Phoenix was the third most popular archetype at the Regional Championships, comprising 9.8% of the metagame. This deck aims to put multiple <auto-card>Arclight Phoenix</auto-card> into the graveyard, typically using <auto-card>Pieces of the Puzzle</auto-card> or <auto-card>Lightning Axe</auto-card>, and then recur them by chaining together three cheap spells in a single turn. Izzet Phoenix can also use <auto-card>Galvanic Iteration</auto-card> to copy <auto-card>Treasure Cruise</auto-card> or <auto-card>Temporal Trespass</auto-card>, which can be a game-winning play.</p>

<p><b>Regional Championship story</b>: Izzet Phoenix peaked in the first Regional Championship weekend, where it won the European Championship in the hands of <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/255886" target="_blank">Miguel Castro</a> and had players <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/255195" target="_blank">Ben Jones</a> and <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/256106" target="_blank">Thierry Ramboa</a> reach the Top 4. <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/255947" target="_blank">Ken Takahama</a> also made it to the finals in the U.S., and <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/255105" target="_blank">Pedro Avena</a> made Top in Brazil. However, as the metagame became more hostile to graveyard strategies and the popularity of Lotus Field combo increased, Izzet Phoenix's results and popularity declined significantly in later weekends. <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/260428" target="_blank">Andy Peters</a> still made Top 8 in Eastern Canada, but performance dropped afterwards.</p>

<p><b>Matchup spread</b>: Izzet Phoenix has strong matchups against Mono-Blue Spirits and Bant Spirits, but struggles against Lotus Field combo and Selesnya Angels. The matchups against Rakdos Midrange and Mono-Green Devotion are close to even and can be heavily influenced by specific card choices and player skill, although Rakdos Midrange may have a slight edge thanks to cards like <auto-card>Go Blank</auto-card>.</p>

<p><b>When facing this deck</b>: When playing against Izzet Phoenix, try to avoid casting spells that can be countered by <auto-card>Spell Pierce</auto-card> if possible. It's usually only a two-of, but if your opponent is conspicuously holding a blue mana open, then consider casting a noncreature spell instead. Another thing to keep in mind is that <auto-card>Ledger Shredder</auto-card> makes double-spelling less appealing, so sequence in a way that avoids granting free connive triggers.</p>

<p><b>Viability in Explorer</b>: On <i>MTG Arena</i>, Izzet Phoenix is missing key cards like <auto-card>Pieces of the Puzzle</auto-card>, <auto-card>Treasure Cruise</auto-card>, <auto-card>Temporal Trespass</auto-card>, and <auto-card>Thing in the Ice</auto-card>, which makes it difficult to build the deck in this delve-spell form.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Mono-White_Humans____49075d4a-4875-4670-9ccf-0db8cba90c55===

<p><b>Quick deck summary</b>: Mono-White Humans is a popular aggro deck that made up 7.6% of the combined metagame at the Regional Championships. It focuses on curving out with powerful Humans on turns one, two, and three, using <auto-card>Thalia's Lieutenant</auto-card> to boost them all. One advantage of staying mono-color is that it allows you to easily fit <auto-card>Mutavault</auto-card> and <auto-card>Castle Ardenvale</auto-card> into your mana base, and you can also steal games with <auto-card>Brave the Elements</auto-card>.</p>

<p><b>Regional Championship story</b>: Mono-White Humans had a strong showing at the Regional Championships, with players such as <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/256856" target="_blank">Matthew Saypoff</a> (winner of the U.S. Regional Championship), <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/259350" target="_blank">Heng Chye Hwee</a> (Top 8 in Southeast Asia), <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/258752" target="_blank">Dalia Morin</a> (Top 8 in Eastern Canada), and <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/262150" target="_blank">Shu-Yu Hsueh</a> and <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/258770" target="_blank">Josh Zhen</a> (both Top 8 in Taiwan) finding success with the deck. Mono-White Humans has a good win rate against the current metagame as a whole.</p>

<p><b>Matchup spread</b>: Mono-White Humans has a good matchup against Mono-Green Devotion, Azorius Control, and Lotus Field combo, but struggles against Gruul Vehicles, Selesnya Angels, and Rakdos Sacrifice. The matchup against Rakdos Midrange is close to even.</p>

<p><b>When facing this deck</b>: Be aware of the possibility of surprise lethal via <auto-card>Brave the Elements</auto-card>. If possible, leave blockers of different colors untapped and attack with your multicolored creatures. Colorless creatures, such as <auto-card>Mutavault</auto-card> or tokens created by <auto-card>Sokenzan, Crucible of Defiance</auto-card>, will always be able to block as well.</p>

<p><b>Viability in Explorer</b>: On <i>MTG Arena</i>, Mono-White Humans is missing <auto-card>Kytheon, Hero of Akros</auto-card> and <auto-card>Thalia, Heretic Cathar</auto-card>, but these one-ofs can be easily replaced, making Mono-White Humans a one of the most popular choices in the format.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Azorius_Control____5aff7753-3615-46d9-bb9c-2cc0d0face32===

<p><b>Quick deck summary</b>: Azorius Control, at 6.4% of the combined Regional Championship metagame, is the premier control deck in Pioneer. It includes a range of standard control elements such as spot removal, countermagic, card draw, sweepers, and planeswalkers. While 80-card builds featuring <auto-card>Yorion, Sky Nomad</auto-card> also exist, as do builds involving <auto-card>Lotus Field</auto-card> and <auto-card>Strict Proctor</auto-card>, the more traditional and consistent 60-card builds are more popular.</p>

<p><b>Regional Championship story</b>: Azorius Control had several strong finishes at the Regional Championships, with players such as <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/256011" target="_blank">Théau Méry</a> (second place in Europe), <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/254547" target="_blank">Derrick Davis</a> (Top 8 in the U.S.), <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/255410" target="_blank">Pedro Perrini</a> (Top 8 in Brazil), <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/260577" target="_blank">Michael Martin Go</a> (winner in Southeast Asia), <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/259887" target="_blank">Kazuya Kiyofuji</a> (Top 8 in Japan), and <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/265561" target="_blank">Mario Flores</a> (Top 8 in Mexico) finding success with the deck.</p>

<p><b>Matchup spread</b>: Azorius Control has a good matchup against Selesnya Angels, Keruga Fires, and Enigmatic Fires, but struggles against the more popular Mono-White Humans. The matchups against Rakdos Midrange and Mono-Green Devotion are close to even.</p>

<p><b>When facing this deck</b>: When playing against this deck, you always have to be wary of sweepers and countermagic. Try not to overextend your threats into <auto-card>Supreme Verdict</auto-card> or <auto-card>Temporary Lockdown</auto-card>, and consider playing a cheaper but worse spell to play around <auto-card>Censor</auto-card> or <auto-card>Make Disappear</auto-card>.</p>

<p><b>Viability in Explorer</b>: In Explorer, Azorius Control is fully legal and is one of the most popular choices in the format.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Gruul_Vehicles____5082f45a-f453-4ab6-a9ed-a2e3e086a46a===

<p><b>Quick deck summary</b>: Gruul Vehicles is a midrange deck that uses <auto-card>Llanowar Elves</auto-card> or <auto-card>Elvish Mystic</auto-card> to ramp into <auto-card>Reckless Stormseeker</auto-card> on turn two. The Werewolf can grant haste to <auto-card>Esika's Chariot</auto-card> or <auto-card>Skysovereign, Consul Flagship</auto-card>, allowing Gruul Vehicles to dominate the battlefield quickly.<i> </i>The vehicles also allow you to tap a stolen creature in response to the third chapter of <auto-card>The Akroan War</auto-card>.</p>

<p><b>Regional Championship story</b>: The archetype did particularly well in Canada, as <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/260641" target="_blank">Noe Offman</a> made Top 8 in Toronto and <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/263699" target="_blank">Violet Davies</a> made Top 8 in Calgary. Violet Davies played a non-Jegantha version featuring <auto-card>Werewolf Pack Leader</auto-card>, which can be a viable alternative in metagames where speed is of the essence. Regardless of the specific build, Gruul Vehicles had a strong win rate throughout the Regional Championships.</p>

<p><b>Matchup spread</b>: Gruul Vehicles is well-positioned in the current metagame, with good matchups against Rakdos Midrange and Mono-White Humans. It struggles against Enigmatic Fires, Rakdos Sacrifice, and Selesnya Angels, which are not seeing much play. The matchup against Mono-Green Devotion is close to even.</p>

<p><b>When facing this deck</b>: Keep a close eye on their companion. If they don't reveal <auto-card>Jegantha, the Wellspring</auto-card> anymore in Game 2 or 3, then that generally means that they boarded in <auto-card>Embercleave</auto-card>. If Jegantha was not revealed in Game 1, then the opponent may be playing the <auto-card>Werewolf Pack Leader</auto-card> version, which is slightly more aggressive.</p>

<p><b>Viability in Explorer</b>: In Explorer, Gruul Vehicles is fully legal and is one of the most popular archetype choices.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Abzan_Greasefang____4869d98e-0168-4c6c-b739-fe75f6e95989===

<p><b>Quick deck summary</b>: Abzan Greasefang is a combo deck with a decent midrange backup plan. Its goal is to put <auto-card>Parhelion II</auto-card> into the graveyard on turn two and to crew it with <auto-card>Greasefang, Okiba Boss</auto-card> on turn three.</p>

<p><b>Regional Championship story</b>: While the deck has had some decent finishes in Regional Championships, such as <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/255043" target="_blank">Eren Kacmaz</a> making it to the Top 8 in Europe and <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/263748" target="_blank">Cameron Sweetnam</a> making it to the Top 8 in Western Canada, it never excelled.</p>

<p><b>Matchup spread</b>: Abzan Greasefang has good matchups against Lotus Field combo and Keruga Fires, but it struggles enormously against Mono-Blue Spirits and Bant Spirits. The matchups against Rakdos Midrange and Mono-Green Devotion are close to even, even with <auto-card>Karn, the Great Creator</auto-card>'s ability to annul <auto-card>Parhelion II</auto-card>'s crew ability.</p>

<p><b>When facing this deck</b>: To best play against this deck, it's important to remember that the best time to kill Greasefang depends on the situation. If the opponent has lots of spare creatures, it's best to kill Greasefang in their main phase before it can trigger. If they have no other pilots, then it's best to kill it with the trigger on the stack so that <auto-card>Parhelion II</auto-card> returns to their hand. Also, if you control <auto-card>Unlicensed Hearse</auto-card> after sideboard, then consider leaving a 2-power crew member untapped to counter <auto-card>Witherbloom Command</auto-card>'s destroy mode.</p>

<p><b>Viability in Explorer</b>: On <i>MTG Arena</i>, Abzan Greasefang is viable, although it's worth noting that <auto-card>Eldritch Evolution</auto-card> and <auto-card>Abrupt Decay</auto-card> are not available. Instead, you could use <auto-card>Liliana of the Veil</auto-card> and <auto-card>Tear Asunder</auto-card>. This archetype was the most-played in the Explorer portion of the <i>Magic</i> World Championship XXVIII several months ago.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Keruga_Fires____3e4b608b-03f5-43ac-b961-4c917cc75514===

<p><b>Quick deck summary</b>: The goal of Keruga Fires is to survive long enough to play <auto-card>Fires of Invention</auto-card> and then dominate the battlefield with five-mana creatures. With <auto-card>Fires of Invention</auto-card>, you can cast Kenrith, Returned King and your companion <auto-card>Keruga, the Macrosage</auto-card> in one turn, leaving mana available for Kenrith activations.</p>

<p><b>Regional Championship story</b>: Keruga Fires had a rough time in the first Regional Championship weekend, largely due to its poor matchup against Mono-Green Devotion. However, after Rakdos Midrange soared ahead, the deck saw more success. <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/260423" target="_blank">Eton Delmoro</a> piloted it to the Top 8 in Southeast Asia, and <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/265486" target="_blank">Brandon Ortiz</a> won with it in Mexico in the penultimate weekend.</p>

<p><b>Matchup spread</b>: Keruga Fires has a bad matchup against Mono-Green Devotion and Azorius Control, but it has a strong advantage against Rakdos Midrange. On the whole, its win rate against the field was poor, and Enigmatic Fires may be a better choice for a <auto-card>Fires of Invention</auto-card> deck.</p>

<p><b>When facing this deck</b>: When playing against this deck, keep in mind that the opponent's options for doing something for less than three mana are limited to <auto-card>Bonecrusher Giant</auto-card>'s adventure, <auto-card>Mystical Dispute</auto-card> from the sideboard, and <auto-card>Leyline Binding</auto-card>. Pay attention to their domain count, as it determines the cost of <auto-card>Leyline Binding</auto-card>.</p>

<p><b>Viability in Explorer</b>: In Explorer, this deck is fully legal.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Lotus_Field_Combo____0348b94f-b043-4b5a-988b-fdfa5fa000d3===

<p><b>Quick deck summary</b>: The game plan of this combo deck is to find <auto-card>Lotus Field</auto-card>, get another copy via <auto-card>Thespian's Stage</auto-card>, and untap those lands with <auto-card>Hidden Strings</auto-card> and <auto-card>Pore Over the Pages</auto-card>, allowing you to generate a lot of mana in one turn. Through a combination of <auto-card>Emergent Ultimatum</auto-card>s, wishes, and tutors, you generally put <auto-card>Omniscience</auto-card> into play, grab <auto-card>Approach of the Second Sun</auto-card> from your sideboard, and cast it twice to win the game.</p>

<p><b>Regional Championship story</b>: Lotus Field was a fringe deck in the first Regional Championship weekend, but <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/256744" target="_blank">John Tatian</a> had a breakout Top 8 finish in the U.S. With an amazing matchup against Izzet Phoenix, it gained popularity. It brought Top 8 finishes for <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/260787" target="_blank">Brennan Crawford</a> in Australia and <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/260054" target="_blank">Matthew Tonary</a> in Eastern Canada, but its success waned as <auto-card>Damping Sphere</auto-card> and other anti-combo sideboard cards became more common in the Pioneer metagame. In later weekends, the deck did not perform as well.</p>

<p><b>Matchup spread</b>: Lotus Field combo has a great matchup against Izzet Phoenix, but it struggles against Mono-White Humans. The matchups against Rakdos Midrange and Mono-Green Devotion are close to even.</p>

<p><b>When facing this deck</b>: A useful way to interact with this combo deck is by destroying their <auto-card>Thespian's Stage</auto-card> with <auto-card>Boseiju, Who Endures</auto-card>, but be sure to choose the right moment—don't let them copy the hexproof <auto-card>Lotus Field</auto-card> in response. In tabletop events, it can be helpful to use pen and paper to track your opponent's mana pool and potential land drop for the turn to keep the game state clear and accurate.</p>

<p><b>Viability in Explorer</b>: On <i>MTG Arena</i>, this archetype is missing <auto-card>Thespian's Stage</auto-card>, <auto-card>Hidden Strings</auto-card>, <auto-card>Pore Over the Pages</auto-card>, <auto-card>Sylvan Scrying</auto-card>, <auto-card>Dark Petition</auto-card>, and <auto-card>Behold the Beyond</auto-card>. As a result, it's not a viable strategy.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Selesnya_Angels____7c8925f4-885f-4794-8ccd-414462afb73f===

<p><b>Quick deck summary</b>: There are many powerful Angels in Pioneer, and Selesnya Angels makes use of several of them. <auto-card>Giada, Font of Hope</auto-card> and <auto-card>Youthful Valkyrie</auto-card> are excellent two-mana Angels, and <auto-card>Bishop of Wings</auto-card> is another strong way to start the curve. <auto-card>Bishop of Wings</auto-card> boosts your life total, which is beneficial for <auto-card>Righteous Valkyrie</auto-card> and <auto-card>Resplendent Angel</auto-card>. With <auto-card>Collected Company</auto-card> and <auto-card>Kayla's Reconstruction</auto-card>, you'll consistently assemble these synergies and fly to victory.</p>

<p><b>Regional Championship story</b>: Selesnya Angels has been on the rise ever since <i><auto-card>The Brothers' War</auto-card></i> added <auto-card>Brushland</auto-card> and <auto-card>Kayla's Reconstruction</auto-card>. In Southeast Asia, <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/260529" target="_blank">Dmitry Medvedev</a> and <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/261083" target="_blank">Alexey Shashov</a> made the Top 8 of their Regional Championships.</p>

<p><b>Matchup spread</b>: Selesnya Angels has a good matchup against Izzet Phoenix, Mono-White Humans and Gruul Vehicles , but it doesn't fare well against Azorius Control.</p>

<p><b>When facing this deck</b>: Keep in mind that their creatures are weak individually but powerful when combined. It's a good idea to destroy their Angels and put pressure on their life total to prevent <auto-card>Giada, Font of Hope</auto-card>, or <auto-card>Righteous Valkyrie</auto-card> from dominating the game. Also, be prepared for a <auto-card>Collected Company</auto-card> into <auto-card>Skyclave Apparition</auto-card> when they pass the turn with four untapped mana, as it can disrupt your combat plans.</p>

<p><b>Viability in Explorer</b>: In Explorer, this deck is fully legal and a popular archetype.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Bant_Spirits____03263d50-d512-4660-9c1e-c13a207a3209===

<p><b>Quick deck summary</b>: Bant Spirits is a popular home for <auto-card>Mausoleum Wanderer</auto-card>, <auto-card>Rattlechains</auto-card>, <auto-card>Shacklegeist</auto-card>, and <auto-card>Supreme Phantom</auto-card>, and it dips into white and green to hit <auto-card>Spell Queller</auto-card> with <auto-card>Collected Company</auto-card>.</p>

<p><b>Regional Championship story</b>: Bant Spirits saw some play, but it had a relatively poor win rate against the overall field and did not have impressive performances.</p>

<p><b>Matchup spread</b>: Bant Spirits has a good matchup against Abzan Greasefang, but it struggles against Rakdos Midrange and Izzet Phoenix.</p>

<p><b>When facing this deck</b>: Be cautious of <auto-card>Spell Queller</auto-card> when they have at least three untapped mana. Think twice before playing your best spell on turn three or four into open mana. Also, remember that <auto-card>Rattlechains</auto-card> can counter your spot removal spells and can grant flash to <auto-card>Supreme Phantom</auto-card>.</p>

<p><b>Viability in Explorer</b>: In Explorer, neither <auto-card>Spell Queller</auto-card> nor <auto-card>Selfless Spirit</auto-card> is available, making Mono-Blue Spirits the dominant approach by far. Almost no one plays Bant Spirits in Explorer.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Mono-Blue_Spirits____5b4d5ccd-34a9-48bf-8802-365c8878e70b===

<p><b>Quick deck summary</b>: Mono-Blue Spirits has many cards in common with Bant Spirits, but it doesn't rely on <auto-card>Collected Company</auto-card>, allowing for more space for noncreature spells, most notably <auto-card>Curious Obsession</auto-card>. If you can stick a <auto-card>Curious Obsession</auto-card> early and protect it with <auto-card>Geistlight Snare</auto-card> or <auto-card>Slip Out the Back</auto-card>, you'll have a significant advantage.</p>

<p><b>The Regional Championship story</b>: Mono-Blue Spirits was about as popular as Bant Spirits, but it had better results. <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/254870" target="_blank">Daniel Kristoff</a> made it to the Top 8 of the U.S. Regional Championship, and <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/258391" target="_blank">Steven Hitchcock</a> made it to the Top 8 in Australia.</p>

<p><b>Matchup spread</b>: Mono-Blue Spirits has a good matchup against Abzan Greasefang and Mono-Green Devotion, but it struggles against Izzet Phoenix. Compared to Bant Spirits, its results against Rakdos Midrange and Mono-Green Devotion were slightly better overall.</p>

<p><b>When facing this deck</b>: Remember that their most-played piece of interaction is <auto-card>Geistlight Snare</auto-card>. Before deciding which spell to cast, check to see if they control a Spirit and an enchantment. If they might be able to play <auto-card>Geistlight Snare</auto-card>, consider sequencing your most important spells around a <auto-card>Mana Leak</auto-card> effect.</p>

<p><b>Viability in Explorer</b>: In Explorer, this deck is fully legal. Mono-Blue Spirits was the third-most played archetype in the Explorer portion of Magic World Championship XXVIII several months ago.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Rakdos_Sacrifice____2c1a40bd-4324-418f-b5c7-4a414bf5cf1b===

<p><b>Quick deck summary</b>: Rakdos Sacrifice is centered around <auto-card>Mayhem Devil</auto-card>, <auto-card>Cauldron Familiar</auto-card>, and <auto-card>Witch's Oven</auto-card>, which create a once-per-turn loop that drains your opponent, deals two damage, and allows you to block for free.</p>

<p><b>Regional Championship story</b>: While only a small portion of the metagame, Rakdos Sacrifice put many players in Regional Championship Top 8s—<a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/256114" target="_blank">André Santos</a> in Europe, <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/255658" target="_blank">Eduardo Vieira</a> in Brazil, <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/262200" target="_blank">Matias Leveratto</a> in South America, and <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/265541" target="_blank">Ricardo Landeta</a> in Mexico. While many players used <auto-card>Jegantha, the Wellspring</auto-card>, non-Jegantha versions with <auto-card>Kari Zev's Expertise</auto-card> put up the best results. Regardless of the specific build, Rakdos Sacrifice had a strong match win rate throughout the regional championships.</p>

<p><b>Matchup spread</b>: Rakdos Sacrifice is well-positioned in the current metagame. It has good matchups against Rakdos Midrange, Mono-White Humans, and Gruul Vehicles, and bad matchups like Izzet Phoenix are on the decline.</p>

<p><b>When facing this deck</b>: Pay close attention to their companion. If they revealed <auto-card>Jegantha, the Wellspring</auto-card> in Game 1 but don't show it in Games 2 or 3, that usually means they've boarded in <auto-card>Kari Zev's Expertise</auto-card>. If they didn't show Jegantha in Game 1, they're probably using the build with main deck <auto-card>Kari Zev's Expertise</auto-card>, so be prepared for your creatures or vehicles to be stolen and sacrificed. If they didn't show Jegantha in Game 1 but only show it after sideboarding when on the play, they're genuine masters of deck construction and sideboard swaps.</p>

<p><b>Viability in Explorer</b>: In the Explorer format, this archetype is missing <auto-card>Urborg, Tomb of Yawgmoth</auto-card> and <auto-card>Dreadbore</auto-card>, none of which are essential. Rakdos Sacrifice was the second-most played archetype in the Explorer portion of Magic World Championship XXVIII several months ago.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Enigmatic_Fires____1e7bbbe0-e217-4967-be48-dce752fd3f05===

<p><b>Quick deck summary</b>: Enigmatic Fires is a toolbox deck that aims to cast <auto-card>Leyline Binding</auto-card> on turn two or turn three, followed by <auto-card>Enigmatic Incarnation</auto-card> on turn four. This allows you to turn your six-mana enchantment into <auto-card>Titan of Industry</auto-card> on turn four. The deck is also capable of powerful turns involving <auto-card>Fires of Invention</auto-card> and the companion <auto-card>Yorion, Sky Nomad</auto-card>. However, every build is different, as there is no consensus on the perfect collection of creatures or lands. Some versions even omit black in favor of better colored mana consistency.</p>

<p><b>Regional Championship story</b>: Despite only being a small portion of the metagame, Enigmatic Fires put a lot of players in Regional Championship Top 8s—<a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/253423" target="_blank">Chris Ferber</a> in the U.S., <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/260190" target="_blank">Norbie Mendoza</a> in Southeast Asia, <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/262440" target="_blank">Joaquin Maletti</a> in South America, and <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/265521" target="_blank">Alonso Mijares</a> in Mexico. Enigmatic Fires had an excellent match win rate throughout the Regional Championships.</p>

<p><b>Matchup spread</b>: Enigmatic Fires is well-positioned in the current metagame. It preys on Rakdos Midrange because effects like <auto-card>Back to Nature</auto-card> or <auto-card>Erase</auto-card> are not available in red or black. Additionally, it has a good matchup against Gruul Vehicles. However, it struggles against Azorius Control.</p>

<p><b>When facing this deck</b>: Be aware that their most common play is to turn a two-mana enchantment into a three-mana creature with an enters-the-battlefield ability. This could be <auto-card>Skyclave Apparition</auto-card> to exile your best threat, <auto-card>Knight of Autumn</auto-card> to gain life, <auto-card>Callous Bloodmage</auto-card> to exile your graveyard, or <auto-card>Moon-Blessed Cleric</auto-card> to search for <auto-card>Leyline Binding</auto-card>. Keeping this in mind will help you better plan for what their deck is capable of.</p>

<p><b>Viability in Explorer</b>: On <i>MTG Arena</i>, <auto-card>Chained to the Rocks</auto-card> is not available, and you'll also need to find replacements for <auto-card>Radiant Flames</auto-card> and <auto-card>Dragonlord Atarka</auto-card> in the sideboard. Nevertheless, <auto-card>Enigmatic Incarnation</auto-card> is playable in Explorer.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Mono-Red_Aggro____e62a51f9-a726-4700-9923-56b08f9f0bb0===

<p><b>Quick deck summary</b>: Mono-Red Aggro is a fast, aggressive deck with several different versions. Some focus on creatures, using cards like <auto-card>Burning-Tree Emissary</auto-card>, <auto-card>Anax, Hardened in the Forge</auto-card>, and <auto-card>Embercleave</auto-card>, while others use damage-oriented cards like <auto-card>Eidolon of the Great Revel</auto-card>, <auto-card>Light Up the Stage</auto-card>, and <auto-card>Lightning Strike</auto-card>. There are also hybrid versions that combine multiple aspects. The goal of all these versions is to take your opponent down to zero life as quickly as possible.</p>

<p><b>Regional Championship story</b>: <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/262330" target="_blank">Alejandro Sepúlveda</a> won the South America Regional Championship with a Mono-Red Aggro build that I would describe as a hybrid version.</p>

<p><b>Matchup spread</b>: Most versions of Mono-Red Aggro have a good matchup against Mono-Green Devotion, but struggle against Gruul Vehicles. However, this depends on the specific build.</p>

<p><b>When facing this deck</b>: When your opponent casts <auto-card>Kumano Faces Kakkazan</auto-card> on turn one, be aware that there are many different builds, each with its own strategies. Some may require you to play around <auto-card>Embercleave</auto-card>, while others may require you to protect your life total at all costs.</p>

<p><b>Viability in Explorer</b>: In the Explorer format, <auto-card>Roast</auto-card> is not available, but it can be replaced with <auto-card>Obliterating Bolt</auto-card>. This could even be an improvement if <auto-card>Old-Growth Troll</auto-card> is more popular than Sheoldred. Mono-Red Aggro is a popular choice in Explorer.</p>

<h1>Looking Ahead</h1>

<p>The Pioneer format offers a range of powerful archetypes, rewards players for their experience, and provides the tools needed to counter any strategy. The best deck choice for the metagame can vary from week to week. In the future, we may see a decline of Rakdos Midrange and an increase in the popularity of Mono-White Humans and Gruul Vehicles. Rakdos Sacrifice and Enigmatic Fires may also become more popular as they try to take advantage of this changing metagame. This could lead to a decrease in popularity for Mono-White Humans and Gruul Vehicles, and Mono-Green Devotion may make a comeback.</p>

<p>The release of the new set, <i>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</i>, is likely to shake things up in February as players prepare for the Pro Tour. The event, which will feature both Pioneer and <i>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</i> draft, will take place at <a href="https://mcphiladelphia.mtgfestivals.com/content/sitebuilder/rna/mtg-festivals/global/en-us/magiccon-news/magiccon-philadelphia-the-lineup.html" target="_blank">MagicCon: Philadelphia</a> on February 17-19. High-level tabletop <i>Magic</i> is back, and I'm excited to see it blossom in 2023 with the return the Pro Tour.</p>

<p>If you're eager to start your competitive <i>Magic</i> journey, store-level RCQs are a great place to start. You can find tournaments on the <a href="https://locator.wizards.com/search?searchType=magic-events&amp;tag=regional_championship_qualifier&amp;query=Los%20Angeles,%20CA,%20USA&amp;distance=100&amp;page=1&amp;sort=date&amp;sortDirection=asc" target="_blank">Store &amp; Event Locator</a> or your <a href="https://magic.gg/pro-tour?section=regional-championships#pro-tour" target="_blank">regional organizer's website</a>. While qualifiers for the second cycle of Regional Championships have ended, current RCQs through April 3, 2023 will feed into the third cycle of Regional Championships.</p>

<p>The second cycle of Regional Championships, held in the Standard format, will take place in March or April (depending on your region) and will feed into the Pro Tour at MagicCon: Minneapolis on May 5-7. The third cycle of Regional Championships will be held in May, June, or July in the Pioneer format, and it will feed the Pro Tour at MagicCon: Europe in July.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Christian Trudel Wins Big at Toronto's F2F Tour</title><link>https://magic.gg/news/christian-trudel-wins-big-at-torontos-f2f-tour</link><guid>https://magic.gg/news/christian-trudel-wins-big-at-torontos-f2f-tour</guid><description><![CDATA[This past weekend, 345 Canadian hopefuls converged upon Toronto for the first of two Regional Championships in Cycle 1. With 14 rounds of Pioneer standing between them and an invite to Pro Tour Philadelphia, as well as a World Championship invite for first place, players braced themselves for a weekend of grueling high-stakes Magic. When the dust settled it was Christian Trudel coming out on top, putting on a dominant 9-0 performance on the second day to win it all with Mono-Green Devotion.

Trudel faced Jordan Tebby on Rakdos Midrange in the finals, a rematch of Round 12 of the Swiss. History repeated itself as Trudel won both matches handily, earning himself the title of Regional Champion. When asked about his deck choice, Trudel praised Mono-Green for being “overwhelmingly powerful” and believed the metagame may have overreacted by shifting away from the archetype so quickly.

The Top 8 players from the Toronto Tour Championship also earned invites to the Pro Tour at MagicCon: Philadelphia in February 2023. Congratulations, and we look forward to seeing you represent Canada at the Pro Tour.

# HALFWAY THERE

The FaceToFace Tour Weekend in Toronto featured a lot of amazing Magic, but it is not the end of the Cycle for the Canadian region. With the region’s invites being split among two events, it is going to be the upcoming Tour Championship in Calgary that will determine the other 8 Pro Tour Competitors (and one more World Championship Competitor!) for Canada. Players competing in the event will want to pay close attention to the metagame breakdown from this past weekend:

Two weeks ago the first F2F Tour Championship, in Toronto, qualified eight players for Pro Tour I in Philadelphia, and winner Christian Trudel also earned a seat at the World Championship.

At the western Championship, players competed in fourteen rounds of Pioneer before cutting to the Top 8, where Joseph Karani, piloting Rakdos Midrange, emerged victorious.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Surrounded by friends, a very emotional Joseph Karani from Winnipeg Manitoba takes down the F2F Tour Championship in Calgary.

Karani, who hails from wintery Winnipeg, defeated Michael Knie on Abzan Greasefang in the finals. It was yet another successful showing for Rakdos Midrange, which has toppled Mono-Green Devotion and other challengers like Mono-White Humans as the most popular deck as the first cycle of Regional Championships has progressed.

# Shaking Up the Top 8

While Karani emerged victorious with Rakdos Midrange, the weekend also marked a comeback for Mono-Green Devotion, which put two copies into the Top 8 after slipping in popularity from the start of the cycle. Abzan Greasefang also made a strong showing, similarly putting two copies into the Top 8.

The biggest surprise, though, was Scott Polsky’s Golgari Elves, which he played to a Top 4 finish.

The Top 8 players from the F2F Tour Championship earned qualifications to Pro Tour I at MagicCon Philadelphia in February 2023. Congratulations, and we look forward to following your competitive journeys next year!

And while the Top 8 reflected some decks finally breaking through into Pioneer success this cycle, the metagame continues to reflect Rakdos Midrange’s rise to the top. The breadth of decks in the Top 8, however, confirms that the Pioneer format still has plenty of room for surprises and niche strategies.

With 18 Pro Tour invites and two seats at <i>Magic</i> World Championship XXIX up for grabs, players fought through two days of fierce Pioneer competition before a winner was crowned: Rei Hirayama, with Rakdos Midrange!

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/WMNhGJw17SqypyBwcXKKa/a6c5bd9653342c9eba0e14fa4463160a/1920x1080-Champions-Cup-Tokoname-Winner-Rei-Hirayama.jpg" /><p class="embedImageCaption">Congratulations to Rei Hirayama!</p></div></div><br />

The championship match was a Rakdos mirror, with runner-up Kyosuke Kyogoku also piloting what was, quite comfortably, the most popular deck at the tournament. The mirror broke the way of Hirayama, however, who dispatched Kyogoku 2-0 in the final and claimed the Champions Cup as his own. Kyogoku didn't go home empty-handed, however - both finalists received an invitation to the next World Championship.

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/4W9ydeuaaGcX2699IcPR3R/5779e52299ce7cf5ab929a2f205e75b2/jpkr-hirayama.jpg" /><p class="embedImageCaption">Rei Hirayama during the finals</p></div></div><br />

The Top 8 was dominated by Rakdos midrange, with six players making it through with the black-red deck. Mono-Green and Azorius Control made brief appearances in the Top 8, but the story of the weekend was definitely the dominance of Rakdos.

As for the players in the Top 8, some huge names from the region stepped up and secured their slots at the next Pro Tour, including two Hall of Famers: both Shuhei Nakamuras and Shota Yasooka proved they've still got it, ending up first and third, respectively, after the Swiss rounds.

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/36hDeRtxpTg9ygSSp4hH0S/28bd9ee1a909acb5290a11cfce515d1c/jpkr-top8.jpg" /><p class="embedImageCaption">The Top 8 from the Champions Cup</p></div></div><br />

While Rakdos was immensely popular (and immensely successful) in Tokoname, plenty of other decks were widely represented at the tournament. Interestingly, Azorius Control was the third-most-played deck at the Champions Cup, outstripping even Izzet Phoenix and putting two copies into the top 12.

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/1yI6YAQq751I7m6bNT334V/2a0c2b378d2355a54728d11f6dd2eac9/jpkr-metagame.jpg" /></div></div><br />

Aside from the Regional Championship tournament itself, the event also saw hundreds of people take part in side events of all kinds. From brand-new ways to play <i>Magic</i>, such as Jumpstart, to the oldest cards in the game doing battle in Vintage, the Champions Cup was a celebration of in-person play, a wonderful example of the gathering we've all missed so much.

It's fitting that as we are celebrating holidays right now that players have seen fit to leave some surprises underneath the tree.</p>

<p>If that tree is the Pioneer format, anyway. The metaphor only goes so far—the point is that we've completed another week of Regional Championships played out across Pioneer, and we have yet another innovative deck winning the events in the hands of a worthy champion. Another curveball in a year full of them, all setting the stage perfectly for the first Pro Tour of 2023 at <a href="https://mcphiladelphia.mtgfestivals.com/en-us.html" target="_blank">MagicCon: Philadelphia</a>.</p>

<p>I should probably back up a little—forgive me but it's easy to get on a roll here at The Week That Was headquarters when we've nearly wrapped what was (for me at least) a true comeback year for <i>Magic</i>'s most enduring quality: the thrill of playing high-stakes tabletop <i>Magic</i> against the best in the world.</p>

<p>Over the past 12 months, players have competed across the world in Regional Championship Qualifiers, aiming to win the local tournament that sends them to one of a host of Regional Championships spread across the globe. Those tournaments bring together the best in the area to compete with truly huge stakes: Pro Tour invitations, yes, but for this string of events <i>World</i> Championship invites as well.</p>

<p>The path is laid out again, a clear line from jamming games of <i>Magic</i> with buddies or on <i>MTG Arena</i> or at the draft tables of Friday Night <i>Magic</i>. The Pro Tour pipeline is flowing, and the Regional Championships of the past six weeks (one remains to be played in China) have been a real throwback to the days of near-weekly Grand Prix. I came into <i>Magic</i> reading Brian David-Marshall writing The Week That Was and recapping the previous weekend's events—getting featured in coverage was an aspirational goal for everyone at my local store who was showing me the ropes. So it's been really fun to document these tournaments in the same way now, as we restart the Pro Tour and fill the ranks of the stories we'll be telling for the 12 months to come.</p>

<p>And there's been plenty of them, too many to list but all documenting the same dream.</p>

<p>Most recently, it was <a href="https://magic.gg/news/the-week-that-was-champions-return-to-the-pro-tour" target="_blank">Joseph Karani at the F2F Tour</a> in Canada punching his ticket to the show. A veteran of the previously mentioned Grand Prix circuit—he won GP Indianapolis in 2019—Karani found himself in the position many of us did this year: checking the calendar to see if we can squeeze in another qualifier. And in the case of one Matias Leveratto, that calendar gave me him exactly one weekend to qualify (which he did). My Twitter feed is once again filled with round-by-round record updates and posts giving the latest blow-by-blow of the tournament, from the bad beats stories to the winner's trophy shot.</p>

<p>And it's given us moments like this:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Surrounded by friends, a very emotional Joseph Karani from Winnipeg Manitoba takes down the F2F Tour Championship in Calgary. He will be representing Canada at the MTG World Championships. Congratulations! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/F2FYYC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#F2FYYC</a> <a href="https://t.co/cB67B10P3B">pic.twitter.com/cB67B10P3B</a></p>&mdash; Face to Face Games (@FaceToFaceGames) <a href="https://twitter.com/FaceToFaceGames/status/1602140703701991424?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 12, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>One of the storylines I haven't gotten a chance to devote as much space to is the evolution of the Pioneer metagame over this run. It's pretty rare for a format to get put through its paces quite so severely with such sustained pressure. But with the Regional Championships all slated for Pioneer—which looks a heck of a lot different than the last time it did in a tabletop Pro Tour level tournament—we didn't know exactly what we were getting into, even if we knew (more or less) what the top decks of the format were, with <auto-card>Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx</auto-card> and its monster Green decks leading the way.</p>

<p>When this happens, things tend to go one of a few ways: things can coalesce into a singular "best deck" (Cawblade, famously). Or we can get the classic rock-paper-scissors metagame (where, for instance, Ramunap Red beats Blue-Black Control but loses to Temur Energy, which was itself weak to Blue-Black).</p>

<p>Or we can get a kind of third route, where the format more or less settles around a handful of diverse decks with no true hierarchy—I think of it more as "tiers" than anything else, with a major feature being the ability of a deck to move up or down the tiers based on the pilot and the pairings. Any Given Sunday, so to speak, for you American football fans. The halcyon days of exploring the then-new Modern metagame back in the day are probably the best example of this, but Pioneer in 2022 is giving off some of those same vibes to someone who has been following results religiously for the past two months.</p>

<p>Which, by the way, you can as well! My column mate Frank Karsten covers the week-to-week shifts of the format and the impact of new sets (<i>The Brothers War</i> has made its impact felt). <a href="https://magic.gg/news/metagame-mentor-the-final-pioneer-update-for-2022" target="_blank">Check out Frank's column for more</a>.</p>

<p>When the Regional Championship season opened up, we found out very quickly that it wasn't exactly a Devotion world the rest of us were living in. In fact, Rakdos Midrange kicked things off with a bang—victory in the first set of events—and despite several other decks including Mono-Green Devotion picking up wins it was the traditional Rakdos route of doing Rakdos things we've seen over the past few years of online events.</p>

<p>But just like I did when I scanned all those BDM articles back in the day, I know it's not the traditional value deck you're looking for—it's the brews that can take a tournament by surprise and maybe punch a Pro Tour ticket while you're at it.</p>

<p>Which brings me to Brandon Ortiz. And back to <i>Throne of Eldraine.</i></p>

<p>You might remember a little enchantment that played a very big role across several formats.</p>

<magic-cards>
  Fires of Invention
</magic-cards>

<p>It's back. In a big way. In fact, <a href="https://magic.gg/news/mexicos-brandon-ortiz-earns-trophy-at-the-gathering-showdown-series" target="_blank">Ortiz's victory at The Gathering Showdown Series</a> (the Mexico City Regional Championship), featured a <auto-card>Fires of Invention</auto-card> mirror match, with Alonso Mijares' <auto-card>Enigmatic Incarnation</auto-card> take on <auto-card>Fires of Invention</auto-card> no less significant than Ortiz's "traditional" <auto-card>Fires of Invention</auto-card> list featuring more <i>Eldraine</i> throwbacks like <auto-card>Kenrith, the Returned King</auto-card> and <auto-card>Bonecrusher Giant</auto-card> (not to mention the elemental blob responsible for the most groans in landfall history: <auto-card>Omnath, Locus of Creation</auto-card>).</p>

<p>I use the word significant because of what this particular mana-cheating mirror represents: a challenger appearing. As Frank predicted, the rise of Rakdos Midrange—which could slow down the haymakers from Devotion just enough while interacting favorably with much of the format—led to a subsequent rise in decks that could go over the top of all that fair <i>Magic,</i> and the result is another evolution in the Pioneer metagame. Not bad for a format getting tackled by an entire world of hungry competitors. All of this rewards players keenly following the week-to-week Regional Championship developments (or at least people who read Frank's column!).</p>

<p>So what's next? <auto-card>Fires of Invention</auto-card> strategies certainly has its own weaknesses. Can Rakdos adapt to shift the matchup enough to stay atop the metagame, or will this fundamentally alter how players approach deck selection moving forward? We've got one more Regional Championship left to sort things out before we tie a bow on the format for 2022 and look toward the Pro Tour in Philadelphia and the next Regional Championship qualifying cycle.</p>

<p>The week-to-week flow of high-level tabletop tournaments is back, and it's been a fun ride to chronicle in my first year helming The Week That Was. Speaking of, I'm excited to say Frank and I will be back for 2023!</p>

<h1>Looking Ahead</h1>

<p>Speaking of 2023, remember it's not just the Pro Tour the Regional Championships are leading toward—there's <i>Magic</i> World Championship XXIX spots on the line every weekend.</p>

<p>The Regional Championship in China is scheduled for this weekend, and it at least begin to tell us more about the answers to these questions, but who knows? <auto-card>Feed the Swarm</auto-card> exists. There's no telling how things will develop before the Pro Tour. That's what keeps it fun!</p>

<p>Once we flip the calendar, the first Pro Tour of the year comes up very quickly. Pro Tour <i>Phyrexia: All is One</i> is <a href="https://mcphiladelphia.mtgfestivals.com/" target="_blank">February 17-19 at MagicCon: Philadelphia</a>, and that means that players will begin congregating at Pro Tour testing houses just a little over a month from now. Get your holiday Cube drafts in while you can; I'll see you in the queues!</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Metagame Mentor: The Final Pioneer Update for 2022</title><link>https://magic.gg/news/metagame-mentor-the-final-pioneer-update-for-2022</link><guid>https://magic.gg/news/metagame-mentor-the-final-pioneer-update-for-2022</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>Hello and welcome back to Metagame Mentor, your weekly guide to the top decks and latest Constructed developments on the path to the Pro Tour. Today, I'll cover the Regional Championships for the West Canada and Mexico/Central America/Caribbean regions. The format for these tournaments, held on December 10-11 and December 17-18 respectively, was Pioneer.</p>

<p>Top eligible players from these Regional Championships earned an invitation to the first Pro Tour in 2023, called Pro Tour Phyrexia: All Is One and held during <a href="https://mcphiladelphia.mtgfestivals.com/content/sitebuilder/rna/mtg-festivals/global/en-us/magiccon-news/magiccon-philadelphia-the-lineup.html" target="_blank">MagicCon: Philadelphia</a> on February 17-19. But you don't have to be qualified for the Pro Tour to enjoy this festival, as it offers something for everyone. You can take a picture with The Weatherlight, attend panels with special guests, participate in a Limited PTQ that qualifies directly for the second Pro Tour in May, and so on. MagicCon: Philadelphia celebrates all things <i>Magic: The Gathering</i>, and it has double the space of MagicCon: Vegas. Don't miss out on your ticket!</p>

<h1>Congratulations to the Two Regional Champions!</h1>

<p>Joseph Karani, whose biggest previous <i>Magic</i> accomplishment was a victory at Grand Prix Indianapolis 2019, won the <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Tournament/View/11822" target="_blank">F2F Tour Championship Calgary</a> (i.e., the West Regional Championship for Canada) on December 11 with <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/263093" target="_blank">Rakdos Midrange</a>.

<p>Over the last few Regional Championship weekends, Rakdos Midrange was the most popular deck by far, and this global trend continued in Canada. Joseph Karani touted the deck's consistency, high card quality, and raw power of <auto-card>Sheoldred, the Apocalypse</auto-card>: "Card's busted."</p>

<p>A relatively new trend for Rakdos Midrange is the inclusion of main deck <auto-card>Reckoner Bankbuster</auto-card>. The vehicle helps grind in the attrition-heavy mirror matches, and it's well-positioned in a metagame where Rakdos Midrange is the most popular deck. You have to be ready for the mirror match, and <auto-card>Reckoner Bankbuster</auto-card> helps with that.</p>

===decklistId:Keruga_Fires_Brandon_Ortiz_The_Gathering_Showdown_Series:_Mexico_City_12_18_22_081e5304-f56b-46aa-b937-a048745b093b===

<p><auto-card>Fires of Invention</auto-card> essentially doubles up your mana while allowing you to spend your lands on <auto-card>Kenrith, the Returned King</auto-card>'s activated abilities. Decks based around this enchantment were a good choice for the metagame, and the finals in Mexico City was a <auto-card>Fires of Invention</auto-card> mirror match! In the finals, Brandon Ortiz's Keruga Fires defeated Alonso Mijares' <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/265521" target="_blank">Enigmatic Fires</a>, but both players got there by cleverly trying to target the most popular deck in the metagame.</p>

<p>To regular readers of this column, this shouldn't come as a surprise. <a href="https://www.magic.gg/news/metagame-mentor-the-quadruple-regional-championship-weekend" target="_blank">Three weeks ago</a>, I wrote: "If [Rakdos Midrange] remains on top, then I'd expect players to flock towards <auto-card>Fires of Invention</auto-card>; <auto-card>Skysovereign, Consul Flagship</auto-card>; or other cards that line up well." <a href="https://www.magic.gg/news/metagame-mentor-pioneer-at-the-south-america-and-chinese-taipei-regional-championships" target="_blank">Two weeks ago</a>, I reinforced that the black and red part of the color pie is traditionally weak to enchantments and that <auto-card>Fires of Invention</auto-card> is one of the best ways to overpower Rakdos Midrange.</p>

<p>Between the two variants, Enigmatic Fires had a higher winrate against the field as a whole and feels more intrinsically powerful, but Keruga Fires may be favored in the head-to-head. In any case, the key lesson to take away is that Rakdos Midrange, like any archetype in Pioneer, is beatable, and <auto-card>Fires of Invention</auto-card> is a good way to do so.</p>

<h1>The Metagame and Win Rates</h1>

<p>Based on all decklists from the two Regional Championships held over the past two weekends, I determined the combined metagame share of every archetype. I also calculated their non-mirror, non-bye, non-draw match win rates. I used my own algorithms and definitions to assign archetype labels, thereby sidestepping any potential mislabeling on MTG Melee. Let's take a look!</p>

<p>The overall metagame at these Regional Championships was quite similar to <a href="https://www.magic.gg/news/metagame-mentor-pioneer-at-the-south-america-and-chinese-taipei-regional-championships" target="_blank">the one from earlier this month</a>, showing that regional metagame differences are relatively small. <i>Magic</i> is a global game indeed. The most notable development is an uptick in Gruul Vehicles, including a new variant with main deck <auto-card>Werewolf Pack Leader</auto-card>, while Izzet Phoenix and Azorius Control plunged somewhat.</p>

<p>In terms of win rates against the field, Gruul Vehicles stands out positively again. Mono-Black Midrange, which can be summarized as Rakdos Midrange with <auto-card>Gifted Aetherborn</auto-card> and <auto-card>Invoke Despair</auto-card> instead of <auto-card>Bloodtithe Harvester</auto-card> and <auto-card>Fable of the Mirror-Breaker</auto-card>, is a promising newcomer too. However, sample sizes are small. For example, for Rakdos Midrange the data gives <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_proportion_confidence_interval#Clopper%E2%80%93Pearson_interval" target="_blank">95% confidence</a> that its true win rate against the field lies in the interval from 47.5% and 56.7%. Due to this wide range, it's hard to draw significant conclusions about performance.</p>

<p>The only exception is Izzet Phoenix, which has really been struggling lately, especially against Rakdos Midrange or Mono-White Humans. The raw power of its engine is still there, and the deck can still excel in the hands of a world-class technical player. Nevertheless, the current metagame is hostile to graveyards due to the presence of <auto-card>Go Blank</auto-card>, <auto-card>Rest in Peace</auto-card>, and so on. This means that Izzet Phoenix may need to reinvent itself or wait until the metagame cycles back to a more favorable spot.</p>

<h1>Spice Corner</h1>

<p>Although the top tables at Pioneer tournaments will largely be populated by Rakdos Midrange, Mono-Green Devotion, and Mono-White Humans, there are many other innovations to pay attention to. It's always exciting to see brewers do well with their own creations, so let's check out the spiciest decks that earned a Pro Tour invite in Calgary or Mexico City.</p>

===decklistId:Esper_Greasefang_Michael_Knie_West_Canada_Regional_Championship_12_11_22_c14b4818-64cf-45a4-a7fe-23428c6fb974===

<p>While Abzan Greasefang remains the most popular combo deck in Pioneer, Michael Knie had been playing his Esper combo-control variant since <i>Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty</i>. Rather than green self-mill cards, he relies on discard effects to put <auto-card>Parhelion II</auto-card> into the graveyard. Also, his list has no backup aggro/midrange plan, as it doesn't include <auto-card>Ledger Shredder</auto-card> or Raffine's Informant. Instead, he has a control plan with <auto-card>Faithful Mending</auto-card>, <auto-card>Collective Brutality</auto-card>, and <auto-card>Supreme Verdict</auto-card>. With his fresh take on the Greasefang strategy, Michael Knie felt he had to prove how viable and good it really is.</p>

<p>And prove it he did. With a second-place finish at the Regional Championship in Calgary, Michael Knie proved that Greasefang decks don't need to be Abzan and don't need an aggro/midrange backup plan.</p>

<p>"Splinter Twin was one of the most powerful archetypes in Modern, and it was a control-combo shell," he explained in his <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V3mMeRF-7g7AAmJOeUq3tK7Msu92sp-b6zkBrto7hr8/edit" target="_blank">tournament report</a>. "Therefore I believed that I could leverage playing control in a combo shell with Greasefang ... it is just my philosophy as a player and how I saw I could attack the Pioneer format."</p>

<p>To me, accomplishments like these show that Pioneer remains underexplored and that Esper Greasefang, when built correctly, is at least on equal footing with Abzan Greasefang.</p>

===decklistId:Gruul_Vehicles_Violet_Davies_West_Canada_Regional_Championship_12_11_22_df14d329-5bfe-4492-98f8-6e921f5e06b6===

<p>Over the course of the Regional Championship season, Gruul Vehicles has emerged as a top-tier strategy that is well-positioned against Rakdos Midrange and Mono-White Humans. While most builds have looked alike with little innovation, Violet Davies showed that there is another way to succeed with a <auto-card>Karplusan Forest</auto-card> deck: by curving <auto-card>Werewolf Pack Leader</auto-card> into <auto-card>Reckless Stormseeker</auto-card>.</p>

<p>The addition of the double-green card, which replaced a combination of <auto-card>Scavenging Ooze</auto-card> and <auto-card>The Akroan War</auto-card> in the "stock" Gruul Vehicles list, required a few cuts: several <auto-card>Mutavault</auto-card> from the main deck and <auto-card>Jegantha, the Wellspring</auto-card> from the sideboard. Even though these cuts hurt, <auto-card>Werewolf Pack Leader</auto-card> provides a more aggressive stance, which is particularly important against decks like Abzan Greasefang or <auto-card>Lotus Field</auto-card> combo where speed is of the essence.</p>

<p>With this novel take on the archetype, <a href="https://twitter.com/aquibian/status/1602359150922854400" target="_blank">Violet Davies</a> finished in the Top 8 of the Regional Championship in Calgary. A player best known as <a href="https://twitter.com/_HappySandwich/status/1603141242417733639" target="_blank">HappySandwich</a> narrowly missed the Top 8 with almost the same list.</p>

<p>Having spent quite a bit of time on this archetype myself, I do believe that the loss of Jegantha hurts substantially against midrange or control decks, but <auto-card>Werewolf Pack Leader</auto-card> is a valid alternative approach in the right metagame. As suggestions to improve this version, I would consider adding <auto-card>Embercleave</auto-card> to the main deck, perhaps instead of an Esika's Chariot and <auto-card>Obliterating Bolt</auto-card>. This is inspired by fellow Hall of Famer <a href="https://www.mtgo.com/en/mtgo/decklist/pioneer-qualifier-2022-10-0112480040#deck_Edel" target="_blank">Willy Edel's version</a> that actually predates the emergence of the archetype as we know it today. In addition, I would tweak the mana base: I would cut <auto-card>Den of the Bugbear</auto-card> for <auto-card>Mountain</auto-card>, as you can't have <auto-card>Den of the Bugbear</auto-card> enter untapped if you cast turn two <auto-card>Werewolf Pack Leader</auto-card>, I would consider shaving another <auto-card>Mutavault</auto-card> for an additional colored lands if I add <auto-card>Embercleave</auto-card>, and I would balance the loss of the creature lands by adding more <auto-card>Lair of the Hydra</auto-card>.</p>

<p>Yet regardless of the exact build, Gruul Vehicles is a good way to prey on the dominance of Rakdos Midrange.</p>

===decklistId:Golgari_Elves_Scott_Polsky_West_Canada_Regional_Championship_12_11_22_4998935f-8fd7-4454-bc91-3bf3b36fd8f8===

<p>Elves ramps ahead with <auto-card>Elvish Mystic</auto-card> and <auto-card>Llanowar Elves</auto-card> in the early game, boosts the team with <auto-card>Elvish Clancaller</auto-card> and <auto-card>Leaf-Crowned Visionary</auto-card> in the mid-game, and wins by casting <auto-card>Chord of Calling</auto-card> for <auto-card>Shaman of the Pack</auto-card> in the late game.</p>

<p>Although the archetype had not seen much competitive success in Pioneer yet, Scott Polsky took his pet deck to the semifinals of the Regional Championship in Calgary, earning a Pro Tour invite. "Elves is the one deck I've played in every possible format from Pauper to Pioneer and Modern," he explained.</p>

<p>To me, this shows that Pioneer is a format where long-term deck familiarity is more important than raw deck strength. The advantage of picking a deck with a few more percentage points against the field in theory is relatively small, whereas deck-specific expertise can give a bigger edge. Experience with a deck will be particularly important when you face situations or matchups you've never seen before, as it helps you figure game plans and sideboard strategies on the fly. In that sense, Pioneer is closer to Modern than it is to Standard. In short, pick a deck you like, and get really good at it. It surely worked for Scott Polsky!</p>

<h1>Looking Ahead</h1>

<p>Due to COVID-19 restrictions, the Regional Championship in China was <a href="https://www.magic.gg/news/magic-china-open-season-1-finals-postponement" target="_blank">postponed</a> and is now scheduled to take place this coming weekend, split across four different locations. You can follow these four events on MTG Melee <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Tournament/View/12811" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Tournament/View/12812" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Tournament/View/12813" target="_blank">here</a>, and <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Tournament/View/12814" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>As this first round of Regional Championships is drawing to a close, let's put all the event types in the new organized play system into perspective, with an eye on 2023.</p>

<p>Working our way from the bottom to the top:</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>Regional Championship Qualifiers (RCQs)</b>: RCQs for the second round of Regional Championships are now in the rear-view window. After a holiday break, RCQs from January 7, 2023 through April 3, 2023 will feed the third round of Regional Championships. Don't miss your chance to qualify by finding tournaments on the <a href="https://locator.wizards.com/" target="_blank">Store &amp; Event Locator</a> or your <a href="https://magic.gg/pro-tour?section=regional-championships#pro-tour" target="_blank">regional organizer's website</a>.</li>
	<li><b>Regional Championships (RCs)</b>: The first round of these major events is almost over, but they happen three times per year. Each time, they are scheduled approximately one to three months before their corresponding Pro Tour. The second round of RCs, featuring the Standard format, takes place in February, March, or April 2023, depending on your region. The third round of RCs, featuring the Pioneer format, takes place in May, June, or July 2023.</li>
	<li><b>Pro Tours (PTs)</b>: The first Pro Tour in 2023, called Pro Tour Phyrexia: All Is One, will be held during MagicCon: Philadelphia on February 17-19. That's where you might see all the players whose decks I highlighted in today's article. The format for that Pro Tour will be Pioneer and <i>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</i> Draft. Subsequently, the second Pro Tour will be held during MagicCon: Minneapolis on May 5-7, and the third Pro Tour will be held at the MagicCon in Europe in July.</li>
	<li><b>World Championship</b>: <i>Magic</i> World Championship XXIX will be held on September 22-24, 2023 at MagicCon: Las Vegas. The field of competitors, who will vie for the total prize pool of $1,000,000, will extend to around 128 competitors. I've already congratulated several Regional Champions on their World Championship invite, and top finishers at future Regional Championships, Arena Championships, MOCS, and Pro Tours from the 2022-23 season will also be invited.</li>
</ul>

<p>High-level tabletop <i>Magic</i> is back, and it will be even better in 2023 with the return the Pro Tour. The first round of Regional Championships has shown the joy of returning to in-person tournaments and high-stakes competition. Top finishers paved their paths to the Pro Tour, pushed the Pioneer metagame forward, and will have the chance to test their mettle against the best of the best at Pro Tour Phyrexia: All Will Be One. Congratulations once again to all top finishers from the Regional Championships, and I look forward to following your competitive journeys next year!</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Mexico's Brandon Ortiz Earns Trophy at The Gathering Showdown Series</title><link>https://magic.gg/news/mexicos-brandon-ortiz-earns-trophy-at-the-gathering-showdown-series</link><guid>https://magic.gg/news/mexicos-brandon-ortiz-earns-trophy-at-the-gathering-showdown-series</guid><description><![CDATA[Last Saturday, 113 players from Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean gathered in Mexico City for The Gathering Showdown Series, the area’s Regional Championship and the culmination of months of qualifying events.

Ortiz defeated Alonso Mijares on Enigmatic Fires in the Finals. It made for an exciting weekend for Fires of Invention, which, while present in the metagame, had yet to take down a Regional Championship–or even put a substantial number of copies into a Top 8. In addition to earning an invite to Pro Tour Phyrexia: All Will Be One at MagicCon: Philadelphia in February, Ortiz also earned a seat at next year’s Magic World Championship XXIX.

# A TOP 8 OF SURPRISES

Despite the rise of Rakdos Midrange at previous Regional Championships–and the fact that it once again had the largest individual share of the metagame–it put only a single copy into the Top 8.

Ahead of Top 8 play Mono-White Humans was the metagame winner of the weekend, with two copies in the Top 8. Ultimately though, the Fires of Invention decks that had struggled to take down any previous Regional Championships showed that the Pioneer metagame is still evolving.

<p>The <a href="https://magic.gg/events/arena-championship-2" target="_blank">Arena Championship 2</a> takes place online as a direct-challenge tournament using <i>Magic: The Gathering Arena</i> on the following days:</p>

<p><b>Day 1:</b> Saturday, March 18, 2023 – 9:00 a.m. PDT / 16:00 UTC / 01:00 Sunday March 19 JST.</p>

<p><b>Day 2 + Top 8:</b> Sunday, March 19, 2023 – 9:00 a.m. PDT / 16:00 UTC / 01:00 Monday March 20 JST</p>

<p>Please note that the above times are the expected start times for each day's play and broadcast. Players who qualify for this event will receive instructions that may have designated check-in times earlier than listed above.</p>

<h1>Event Formats</h1>

<p>The formats for Arena Championship 2 are Traditional Historic and Traditional <i>All Will Be One</i> Draft (both Best-of-Three with sideboard) on <i>Magic: The Gathering Arena</i>.</p>

<h1>Deck Submissions</h1>

<p>Players must submit their Traditional Historic decklist no later than Sunday, March 12, 2023 at 11:59 p.m. PDT (6:59 Monday UTC / 15:59 Monday JST). Decklists must be submitted to MTG Melee via your Player Controller for the event.</p>

<h1>Invitation List</h1>

<p>The <a href="https://magic.gg/standings/Arena%20Championship%201" target="_blank">current Leaderboard standings and invitation list for Arena Championship 2</a> is available online.</p>

<p>If you believe you are an invited competitor but are not on the invitation list, please email <a href="mailto:premierplay@wizards.com" target="_blank">premierplay@wizards.com</a>.</p>

<h1>Tournament Structure</h1>

<p>The event will be 9 rounds of Swiss, with 3 rounds of Traditional <i>All Will Be One</i> Draft and 6 rounds of Traditional Historic Constructed, followed by a single-elimination Top 8 playoff using Traditional Historic Constructed.</p>

<p>All rounds of competition use the Tournament Match Direct Challenge settings via Direct Challenge in <i>Magic: The Gathering Arena</i>, which means:</p>

<p>30-minute time banks for player priority are enforced in-client.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Timers are on.</li>
	<li>Matches are best two-out-of-three games.</li>
	<li>Players should double-check to ensure they have selected the correct format for each round.
	<ul>
		<li><i>Historic Tournament Match</i> for Historic</li>
		<li><i>Limited Tournament Match</i> for Draft</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>For the Arena Championship 2 there are no draws, intentional or otherwise, during the Swiss rounds. Players are expected to play until a winner is declared, either via traditional means of ending a match if Traditional Historic or Traditional Limited, or via a player's time bank running out.</p>

<p>Additionally, concessions of matches that have not reached a clear, natural conclusion are not allowed in this tournament. All competitors are expected to play to the best of their abilities to reach a point of natural conclusion for each match.</p>

<p>The following are acceptable examples in which a player may concede the game:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A player is being attacked for lethal damage and sees no means of surviving the turn.</li>
	<li>A player has reasoned that they have no lines of play in which they can win the current game and wishes to concede to conserve their time bank.</li>
	<li>Players have been instructed to concede games in an admin-ruled match remake due to a compromised match that was restarted.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following are unacceptable examples in which a player should not concede:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A player has not played a single turn of a game.</li>
	<li>A player is choosing to concede when it is clear they have an advantage.</li>
	<li>A player chooses to mulligan to virtually no cards as a workaround to not technically concede, despite drawing multiple playable hands.</li>
</ul>

<p>In general, the goal of this rule is ensuring that matches in this tournament are decided by players completing matches of <i>Magic: The Gathering Arena</i> in best-of-three Traditional Historic and Traditional Limited formats and are not influenced by outside motivations. Players that violate this rule with the intent that goes against the philosophy of this rule may be subject to penalties as defined in the Digital Magic Tournament Rules.</p>

<h1>Day 1: 6 Swiss Rounds</h1>

<p>Drafting begins on Saturday, March 18, 2022 – 8:00 a.m. PDT / 15:00 UTC / 00:00 Sunday March 19 JST.</p>

<p>Play begins on Saturday, March 18, 2022 – 9:00 a.m. PDT / 16:00 UTC / 01:00 Sunday March 19 JST.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Rounds 1-3: <i>All Will Be One</i> Draft</li>
	<li>Rounds 4-6: Historic Constructed</li>
</ul>

<h1>Day 2: 3 Swiss Rounds and Single-Elimination Top 8</h1>

<ul>
	<li>Rounds 7-9: Historic Constructed</li>
	<li>Top 8: Historic Constructed; Finals are best of three matches.</li>
</ul>

<h1>January 2023 Qualifier Weekend Event Information</h1>

<h2>Event Format</h2>

<p>January 2023 Qualifier Weekend's gameplay format is Alchemy Constructed. Players compete in either Best-of-One or Best-of-Three events with a minimum 60-card main deck with up to 15 cards in the sideboard.</p>

<h2>Event Schedule</h2>

<h4>Friday, January 6th</h4>

<p>Players who have qualified for this event will see a Qualifier Token in the top right corner of the screen beside the Wildcard display and receive an email with initial event details and their final standing in the Ranked Ladder.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/QbElxCE1Ef6mxOjqZXPlQ/812fb9a41cc56172c2ad0f452889c9f7/508x144-Qualifier-Weekend-Information-Token-Text.jpg" /></div></div><br />

<p><i>NOTE: This is a systemic change—you will no longer see the Qualifier Badge on your Profile tab. The presence of the Qualifier Token is the sole in-client method of showing qualification prior to the event.</i></p>

<p>If you earn an invitation via a Wizards-approved tournament organizer or from the Arena Open, your Qualifier Token will be granted at the same time as ranked season players in the month you qualified (i.e., if your event took place in June, you would receive your Qualifier Token by July 6).</p>

<p>The grant of Qualifier Tokens to accounts is a manual process completed by the date listed above following the ranked season's completion. Please wait to contact Customer Service until then to confirm your eligibility.</p>

<p>If you believe you have qualified <i>(via the Ladder or via another method)</i> and you do not see the Qualifier Token on your account after the date mentioned for the season you qualified, please contact <a href="https://mtgarena-support.wizards.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000419612" target="_blank">Customer Service</a> as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Players who finished 251st-1200th in the Ranked Season in either Constructed or Limited <i>(and did not finish in the Top 250 in the other Ladder)</i> will be granted 20 Play-In Points by this date – more details can be <a href="https://magic.gg/events/qualifier-play-in" target="_blank">found here</a>.</p>

<h2>Qualifier Play-In Events</h2>

<p>Players can also earn the Qualifier Token by earning maximum wins in a single course of a Play-In event feeding that Qualifier Weekend. There are typically two Qualifier Play-Ins each month:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A Best-of-One event is held on Saturday, seven days before Qualifier Weekend.</li>
	<li>A Best-of-Three event is held on Friday, the day before Qualifier Weekend.</li>
</ul>

<p>Players who already hold an invitation to Qualifier Weekend are permitted to enter Qualifier Play-In events, though any invitations earned are redundant and do not pass down to other players or months.</p>

<p>Get <a href="https://magic.gg/events/qualifier-play-in" target="_blank">full details on Qualifier Play-In events</a>.</p>

<h1>Qualifier Weekend Structure</h1>

<p>The Qualifier Weekend takes place as a special event in <i>Magic: The Gathering Arena</i>. Players who have the Qualifier Token in their account will see the event and will be eligible to compete in one course of it during Day One. Both days of competition are Best-of-Three with sideboarding.</p>

<h2>General Structure—Day One</h2>

<p>For Constructed formats, the event will allow a player to select their deck prior to any match play, but once a deck is chosen, it cannot be changed for the remainder of the Day One event.</p>

<p>For Phantom Sealed formats, players will have access to six Limited boosters of the corresponding <i>Magic</i> set and must build a deck with a minimum of 40 cards. Other cards that were opened and available in the Sealed pool will be available in that player's sideboard between games of each Best-of-Three match. Additionally, players may modify their 40-card deck between matches during this event after initially submitting a deck. Cards opened will not be added to players' collections.</p>

<p>For Phantom Draft formats, players will draft anonymously within the Traditional Draft queue and must build a deck with a minimum of 40 cards. Other cards that were drafted will be available in that player's sideboard between games of each Best-of-Three match. Additionally, players may modify their main deck between matches during this event. After each match completes, each player's deck will be automatically de-sideboarded by the game client. Cards opened will not be added to players' collections.</p>

<h2>Day One Entry Window</h2>

<p>Players will be able to join the event on Day One no earlier than Saturday at 6 a.m. PT and no later than 8 a.m. PT. Late entries <i>cannot</i> be accommodated. The entry window is in place to ensure lower matchmaking times and to permit players enough time to complete all Day One matches.</p>

<p>Players can participate in Day One until they receive either seven match wins or two match losses. If a player earns seven match wins, an in-game notification will appear, and a Day Two Token will appear on the top right corner of the player's Home screen in-client.</p>

<h2>General Structure—Day Two</h2>

<p>For Day Two, players will only be able to participate if they earned seven match wins on Day One, or they were directly invited to Day Two as mentioned above. Eligible players should receive a Day Two Token that appears in the top right corner of the Home screen. That token will appear in eligible players' accounts by the Thursday prior to the Qualifier Weekend (for direct invitees) or as soon as the seven-win Day One course ends. Players who expect to be able to join Day Two but cannot do so should contact <a href="https://mtgarena-support.wizards.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000419612" target="_blank">Customer Support</a> for assistance.</p>

<p>Due to the Day Two event being available to many fewer participants than Day One, competitors are strongly encouraged to complete all their games as soon as possible. As the event nears its completion, matchmaking times may take longer than normal.</p>

<p>Players who are eligible to participate on Day Two can play in one course that ends when they receive either seven match wins or two match losses.</p>

<p>For Constructed formats, players are permitted to enter with the same deck as Day One (if applicable), the same deck but with changes, or a different deck. Once a player begins their Day Two course, no further deck changes are permitted.</p>

<p>For Phantom Sealed formats, like Day One, players will have access to a new pool of six Limited boosters of the corresponding <i>Magic</i> set and must build a deck with a minimum of 40 cards. Other cards that were opened and available in the Sealed pool will be available in that player's sideboard between games of each Best-of-Three match. Additionally, players may modify their 40-card deck between matches during this event after initially submitting a deck. Cards opened will not be added to players' collections.</p>

<p>For Phantom Draft formats, like Day One, players will draft a new deck anonymously within the Traditional Draft queue and must build a deck with a minimum of 40 cards. Other cards that were drafted will be available in that player's sideboard between games of each Best-of-Three match. Additionally, players may modify their main deck between matches during this event. After each match completes, each player's deck will be automatically de-sideboarded by the game client. Cards opened will not be added to players' collections.</p>

<h2>Day Two Entry Window</h2>

<p>Players will be able to join the event on Day Two no earlier than Sunday at 6 a.m. PT and no later than 8 a.m. PT. Late entries <i>cannot</i> be accommodated. The entry window is in place to ensure lower matchmaking times and to permit players enough time to complete all Day Two matches.</p>

<h2>Match Play in Arena</h2>

<p>Players are expected to compete under the implemented rules for <i>Magic: The Gathering Arena</i>.</p>

<p>Each player will have 30 minutes on their respective match clock that will count down whenever that player has priority. To see the clock, hover your cursor over the bottom-left corner of the screen beside your display name.</p>

<p>If a player runs out of time on their clock before the current game finishes, they will lose the match regardless of the current board state.</p>

<h2>Participation</h2>

<p>Participation in the Qualifier Weekend, the Arena Championship, or any events supported by Wizards of the Coast or the <i>Magic</i> Pro League LLC, is contingent on players having accounts that are in good standing for <i>Magic: The Gathering Arena</i> and competitive tabletop <i>Magic: The Gathering</i>. Players suspended from participation in <i>Magic: The Gathering Arena</i> or in sanctioned tabletop tournaments are ineligible for any prizes and subject to additional action.</p>

<p>Players in <i>Magic: The Gathering Arena</i> events are required to follow the Wizards <a href="http://company.wizards.com/legal/terms" target="_blank">Terms and Conditions</a>.</p>

<h2>Connectivity and Known Issues</h2>

<p>Players should review <a href="https://mtgarena-support.wizards.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000091646-Known-Issues-List" target="_blank">known issues</a> in <i>Magic: The Gathering Arena</i> prior to participation in the Qualifier Weekend and the Arena Championship. Wizards is not responsible for impacts on the game because of players experiencing known issues.</p>

<p>Wizards of the Coast is not responsible for the results of any disconnection or network problems experienced by players.</p>

<h2>Eligibility &amp; Prizes</h2>

<p>Once a player qualifies for the Arena Championship, they become ineligible to participate in other Qualifier Play-In events and Qualifier Weekends feeding that Championship. Players who qualify for the Championship will have their Qualifier Token removed if they otherwise would receive it through monthly ranked season performance.</p>

<p>That player can continue to compete in <i>Magic Online</i> Premier Play.</p>

<p>All prizes are awarded “as is” and without warranty of any kind, expressed, or implied (including without limitation, any implied warranty or merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose). This is a contest of skill and, therefore, there are no odds of winning as is the case with a game of chance. All applicable taxes, fees, duties, tariffs, passport or visa costs, and any license, destination, entry, exit, and/or delivery charges are the sole responsibility of each player. Taxes on prizes (including, without limitation, income taxes), if any, are the sole responsibility of any player winners.</p>

<p>Invitations to the Arena Championship are contingent on signing a waiver and consent form. These documents will be provided to all competitors who receive invitations so that they can sign and submit prior to attending the event.</p>

<p>Players may be disqualified from the Qualifier Weekend or from participation in the Arena Championship if they are suspended from <i>Magic: The Gathering Arena</i> or sanctioned <i>Magic: The Gathering</i> tabletop play for any reason, including without limitation, a violation of the <i>Magic: The Gathering Arena</i> End User License Agreement.</p>

<p>Although a player may have multiple accounts qualified for the Qualifier Weekend event, only one of those accounts can be entered into that event. Players are not permitted to have any accounts entered in events played by other players for any reason. If a player is discovered to have more than one account playing in the Qualifier Weekend before, during, or after the event, Wizards may take action against that player's account(s), up to and including disqualification, suspension of the offending account(s), and/or termination of the offending account(s). Using an account other than your own, allowing any other player to use your account, selling your account, and other similar actions are all violations of the <i>Magic: The Gathering Arena</i> User Agreement.</p>

<p>Wizards of the Coast reserves the right to reschedule and/or restart tournaments, matches, and extend timers and/or games as needed.</p>

<p>To be eligible to participate in Qualifier Weekend and the Arena Championship, the following requirements must be met:</p>

<ul>
	<li>All players must be at least 18 years of age or older on the date of the event.</li>
	<li>Players must have internet access and a <a href="https://myaccounts.wizards.com/login" target="_blank">Wizards Account</a>.</li>

<p>All about it, in fact. He's been there. Under the brightest lights in the biggest <i>Magic</i> tournament of his life, Leveratto performed. He famously beat Brad Nelson in <a href="https://www.magic.gg/news/a-champions-path-back-to-magic" target="_blank">the finals of a Mythic Championship in 2019</a>, capping a near-miraculous return to high-level play. To win that tournament (and subsequently qualify for the Rivals League, something he considers one of his greatest <i>Magic</i> accomplishments), Leveratto faced down the odds again and again on his way to victory. It was one of the most enjoyable success stories of the <i>Arena</i> era to follow, and demonstrated that the dream was still alive for someone to come back to the game after years away and rise all the way to the top of the Mythic Championship.</p>

<p>So it won't surprise you to find out that Leveratto defied the odds again in his return to the Pro Tour in 2022. After all—here at <a href="https://magic.gg/news/the-week-that-was-making-it-to-the-big-stage" target="_blank">The Week That Was</a> you're used to hearing stories of players overcoming long odds to make Pro Tour dreams come true.</p>

<p>But even grading on that curve, <i>this</i> particular Leveratto story jumped out to me, for degree of difficulty if nothing else.</p>

<p>"When the return of physical tournaments and the Pro Tour were finally announced, I knew that my goal was to qualify again," he began.</p>

<p><i>So far, so good.</i></p>

<p>"Unfortunately, the qualifying season for the Regional Championship took place at the time that I had gone to live three months abroad," he continued.</p>

<p><i>Uh-oh. That doesn't sound great.</i></p>

<p>"But I was lucky enough to at least have one chance—I was returning one day before the last weekend of Regional Championship Qualifiers."</p>

<p>A "quick" plane ride across the globe brought Leveratto home in the nick of time, and jet lag fighting for space with sideboard guides in the champion's brain, he was at the table, finally. A deck and a chair.</p>

<p>"In the end I managed to qualify by winning a Modern RCQ playing Living End," Leveratto finished.</p>

===decklistId:Rakdos_Midrange_Matias_Leveratto_South_America_Regional_Championship_12_3_2022_51c81022-d656-41c4-9d38-afbbb07c28b3===

<p>That's <i>Magic</i> under pressure. And it's what brought Leveratto back to the Pro Tour after his recent Top 4 finish at the South America <i>Magic</i> Series Regional Championship (<a href="https://magic.gg/news/alejandro-sepulveda-reigns-supreme-at-south-america-magic-series-santiago">ultimately won by Alejandro Sepulveda</a>).</p>

<p>Next up is the Pro Tour at <a href="https://mcphiladelphia.mtgfestivals.com/en-us.html" target="_blank">MagicCon: Philadelphia</a>. For Leveratto, it's a tournament three years in the making.</p>

<p>"This comes after having managed to establish myself in the professional circuit and qualify for the Rivals League, and I was very excited to travel around the world—one of the things I like the most—and compete together with my friends Sebastian Pozzo and Luis Salvatto. 2020 was going to be a great year, it started with the Worlds Championship in Hawaii and I was already planning the rest of the year. Covid arrived and ruined all I had in mind. All the tournaments became online and the possibility of traveling the and sharing experiences with many players from all over the world was put on hold."</p>

<p>Now Leveratto is back. He's one of dozens of players across the world who have qualified for the first Pro Tour of 2023 with their performances in Regional Championships. The past five weeks have been a wild sprint through the Pioneer format as players punch their ticket back to the PT while at the same time pushing Pioneer forward with successive high-quality events.</p>

<p>The stakes are meaningful, and players have responded in kind. We've seen the return of <a href="https://magic.gg/news/the-week-that-was-many-hands-make-qualifying-light-work" target="_blank">"Pro Tour" houses</a> and teams have formed across the world to dissect the previous weekend's results and put in the work to prepare for a field trying to one-up last week's Top 8. As Leveratto put it, the Regional Championships are a perfect glimpse into what the Pro Tour will look like.</p>

<p>"The Regional Championship in Chile was a mini-preview of what the Pro Tour could be, since I traveled to compete with several of my friends from Argentina," he explained. "I've been playing Rakdos Sac in Pioneer for months now and it's the deck I used to win the Mana Traders' tournament in October, so I felt pretty confident. In any case, I knew that it was going to be very difficult because it was going to be a very big tournament and that it only distributed four places for the Pro Tour. But despite the difficulties that we always have in Latin America to compete in the professional circuit, do not give up. Far from discouraging me, that motivated me to try to classify and be able to LATAM at the top and show that due to the level of play we deserve more opportunities.</p>

<p>"Now that I have qualified for the Pro Tour, my objective is going to be to prepare myself like never before to try to reach the top."</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Top4!!!!!!<br>🔥🧙‍♂️🖤♥️<br><br>I qualify for the ProTour 🤗🇦🇷 <a href="https://t.co/MdLCQNBy4K">https://t.co/MdLCQNBy4K</a></p>&mdash; Levunga | MT8 (@levunga) <a href="https://twitter.com/levunga/status/1599485364762091521?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 4, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>We'll see Leveratto again in Philly after his epic Rakdos run. And with thousands of players across the world keeping a keen eye out to take in the results, the South America Regional Championship set the stage for what was to come half a world away a week later.</p>

<h1>Meanwhile, In The Other Hemisphere...</h1>

<p>Joseph Karani was one of those players anxiously awaiting the latest tournament decklists. (I suggest <a href="https://magic.gg/news/metagame-mentor-standard-and-modern-with-the-brothers-war" target="_blank">Frank Karsten's column for that</a>.) Karani is the rare player who gains more from theory-crafting and analyzing formats than he does slamming hundreds of practice games, and the numbers coming out of South America only furthered what he had come to believe after watching Regional Championship results roll in from North America, Europe, and Asia in the preceding weeks: Rakdos Midrange was the deck to play.</p>

<p>"There's no amount of testing one person can do to get a full understanding of a format the way you can with following the results over the course of hundreds or thousands of games," he explained. "Too many players will focus on hard testing. What I want to do is the mental reps of the matchups with a look at the data.</p>

<p>"Before this tournament, I watched all the Regional Championship coverage I could find. I watched the games and studied them and digested the data. The way I approach <i>Magic,</i> I don't have time to test all the time, so in the week leading up to the tournament I looked at all the data and locked in the deck and just wanted to tune it. At that point me and other Winnipeg locals played a ton over the week, making sideboard guides and a plan for every matchup. It was tiring, and I would say it was 90% theory and 10% testing, but it was worth it in the end."</p>

<p>I'd say so. Not only did Karani's team put four members into the Top 16—the Winnipeg <i>Magic</i> community will be well-represented in Philadelphia—but Karani himself turned in an undefeated Day 2 performance, a spectacular Top 8 run and a victory at the <a href="https://magic.gg/news/joseph-karani-claims-victory-at-f2f-tour-calgary" target="_blank">F2F Tour Championship that doubled as the West Canada Regional Championship.</a></p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Surrounded by friends, a very emotional Joseph Karani from Winnipeg Manitoba takes down the F2F Tour Championship in Calgary.

<p>Karani—who burst onto the <i>Magic</i> scene in 2019 with a win at Grand Prix Indianapolis alongside teammates Mohamad Qadi and Kevin Brown and added a Top 8 at a Face To Face Open that year—can't wait to get back to the Pro Tour.</p>

<p>"I had taken a step back; online play didn't really interest me the same way playing in person does, so I was really excited when the Face 2 Face Tour was announce again and the Pro Tour came back. I thought it was time to saddle it up again and see if I could run it back and maybe play on the Pro Tour again.</p>

<p>"Then this happened. Looking at 2023, I'm going to every Pro Tour I can. Plus I have a World Championship invite, which is still unreal at this point to even think about. That was never on my goal radar; I don't know how to even process that yet."</p>

<p>Karani plans on putting a ton of work into <i>Magic</i> over the next year (plus a recent appearance on the <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/first-strike/id1179017028" target="_blank">First Strike podcast</a>) and he can't wait to keep going.</p>

<p>"It's going to be a lot more work, but I welcome it and I'm excited to do it again," he said. "I get to do it with a very strong Winnipeg community supporting me. I'm a very emotional guy, and I was crying and hugging my boys when I won. We have a very strong community of Winnipeggers—we aren't a big city and we have brutal winters so you may as well play some cardboard with your friends, you know?"</p>

<p>Don't worry, Joseph. Philadelphia gets plenty cold, too. We'll see you there.</p>

<h1>Looking Ahead</h1>

<p>I keep saying it, but it really is a booming period for high-level <i>Magic.</i> To wit, Eternal Weekend in North America just went off without a hitch and featured some of the most iconic <i>Magic</i> gameplay we can hope to see (and yes, a lot of taking the initiative as well), and it generated a <a href="https://twitter.com/anzidmtg/status/1602917609426792448" target="_blank">ton of great stories in itself</a>, plus some very worthy winners who took home <a href="https://twitter.com/rykerwilliams/status/1602682756751798272" target="_blank">some very cool prizes</a>!</p>

<p>Next up on the path the Pro Tour is the <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Tournament/View/12862" target="_blank">Mexico/Central America/Caribbean Regional Championship</a> taking place this weekend in Mexico City. With that, we'll be off into 2023 and turn our eyes to the Pro Tour that's just two short months away—February 17–19, 2023!</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Metagame Mentor: Standard and Modern with The Brothers' War</title><link>https://magic.gg/news/metagame-mentor-standard-and-modern-with-the-brothers-war</link><guid>https://magic.gg/news/metagame-mentor-standard-and-modern-with-the-brothers-war</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to Metagame Mentor, your weekly guide to the top decks and latest Constructed developments on the path to the Pro Tour. This week, I'm taking a brief break from coverage of the ongoing Pioneer Regional Championships. Instead, I'll look at the biggest innovations in Standard and Modern since the release of <i>The Brothers' War</i>.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/DJPNxAlrmrCNwY5ZB7Fc6/a1e2363f540575f16e5741b149b2280d/1080x1080-Magic-Premier-Play-Path-2022-2023-Infographic.jpg" /></div></div><br />

<p>Regional Championship Qualifiers (RCQs) in these formats are happening right now. Until December 19, 2022, RCQs will feed the second round of Regional Championships, which will be held in February, March, or April 2023 depending on your region. After a holiday break, RCQs from January 7, 2023 through April 3, 2023 will feed the third round of Regional Championships, which will be held in May, June, or July 2023. Don't miss your chance to qualify by finding tournaments on the <a href="https://locator.wizards.com/" target="_blank">Store &amp; Event Locator</a> or your <a href="https://magic.gg/pro-tour?section=regional-championships#pro-tour" target="_blank">regional organizer's website</a>.</p>

<h1>Standard with The Brothers' War</h1>

<p>To provide a metagame snapshot for <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/formats/standard" target="_blank">Standard</a>, I used all <a href="https://www.mtgo.com/en/mtgo/decklists" target="_blank"><i>Magic Online</i> decklists</a> from Standard Challenge, Standard Last Chance, and Standard Showcase Qualifier events held from November 21 through December 12. In addition, I included all decklists with net positive records from Standard tournaments on <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklists/Standard" target="_blank">MTG Melee</a> from the same time period, which captures the last three weeks of competition.</p>

<p>After correcting archetypes and assigning to each deck a number of points equal to its number of match wins minus its number of match losses, I derived the following record-weighted metagame breakdown. It may be interpreted as a winner's metagame that you can expect to see at the top tables. Archetype names hyperlink to a well-performing decklist closest to the aggregate of the archetype. Up and down arrows signify the biggest changes compared to <a href="https://magic.gg/news/metagame-mentor-november-2022-standard-pioneer-and-modern-updates" target="_blank">my metagame roundup from early November</a>, right before the release of <i>The Brothers' War</i>.</p>

<p>At 36.8% of the winner's metagame, Grixis Midrange continues its domination of Standard. The deck won the <a href="https://magic.gg/events/magic-world-championship-xxviii" target="_blank">World Championship</a> in the hands of Nathan Steuer, and it hasn't slowed down after the release of <i>The Brothers' War</i>. Grixis has the best threats, interaction, and card advantage across blue, black, and red, and there are various ways to build it. But no matter how you slice it, you can control the early game with <auto-card>Make Disappear</auto-card> and <auto-card>Bloodtithe Harvester</auto-card>, pull ahead on card advantage with <auto-card>Fable of the Mirror-Breaker</auto-card> and <auto-card>Corpse Appraiser</auto-card>, and close out the game with <auto-card>Invoke Despair</auto-card>.</p>

<p>Yet cards from the new set have led to substantial Standard metagame shifts. The top 10 most-played new cards from <i>The Brothers' War</i> across my 450-decklist data set have boosted existing Standard archetypes and delivered new ones:</p>

<ul>
	<li><b><auto-card>Go for the Throat</auto-card> (876 copies):</b> An efficient removal spell with a nearly negligible restriction as the downside. In many black midrange decks, it has replaced <auto-card>Infernal Grasp</auto-card>.</li>
	<li><b><auto-card>Brotherhood's End</auto-card> (514 copies):</b> A three-mana sweeper that is particularly potent against aggro decks. It's mostly a sideboard card, but various Rakdos Midrange decks have even included it in their main decks.</li>
	<li><b><auto-card>Mishra's Foundry</auto-card> (286 copies):</b> A creature land that fits into mana base that already has more than enough colored sources. <auto-card>Mishra's Foundry</auto-card> has made its way into nearly every mono-color deck.</li>
	<li><b><auto-card>Lay Down Arms</auto-card> (231 copies):</b> A removal spell that can take out opposing creatures at an extremely mana-efficient rate. It has led to the emergence of Mono-White Midrange, which has enough Plains for the card to shine.</li>
	<li><b><auto-card>Phyrexian Fleshgorger</auto-card> (205 copies):</b> A flexible creature that punishes <auto-card>Abrade</auto-card> and other removal spells. It has enhanced the creature curve of Mono-Black Aggro in particular.</li>
	<li><b><auto-card>Underground River</auto-card> (199 copies):</b> A pain land that improves the consistency at which you can cast your blue and black spells. It has enhanced the mana base of Esper Midrange, Grixis Sacrifice, and so on.</li>
	<li><b><auto-card>Steel Seraph</auto-card> (174 copies):</b> A flexible creature that not only provides an immediate combat effect but also dodges <auto-card>Go for the Throat</auto-card>, <auto-card>Cut Down</auto-card>, and <auto-card>Destroy Evil</auto-card>. It has found a home in Mono-White Midrange and Mardu Midrange.</li>
	<li><b><auto-card>Loran of the Third Path</auto-card> (170 copies):</b> A way to add to the battlefield while destroying <auto-card>Reckoner Bankbuster</auto-card>, <auto-card>Oni-Cult Anvil</auto-card>, or <auto-card>Wedding Announcement</auto-card>. It's mostly a sideboard card, but various Esper Legends decks have even included it in their main decks.</li>
	<li><b><auto-card>Gix, Yawgmoth Praetor</auto-card> (146 copies):</b> A powerful creature that makes cheap, difficult-to-block creatures more curious. Gix synergizes well with <auto-card>Evolved Sleeper</auto-card>, <auto-card>Misery's Shadow</auto-card>, and <auto-card>Phyrexian Fleshgorger</auto-card>, and it has given mono-black decks a more aggressive orientation.</li>
	<li><b><auto-card>Monastery Swiftspear</auto-card> (116 copies):</b> A Pioneer and Modern staple that has now also found its way into Standard. It has revitalized Mono-Red Aggro.</li>
</ul>

<p>So these are the top new cards, but what do the new decks look like? If you last played Standard right before <i>The Brothers' War</i>, then the following five decklists should get you back up to speed.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Mono-White_Midrange____14f4cf76-416e-43fb-ae29-3fb577a90034===

<p>Mono-White Midrange, at 12.5% of the record-weighted metagame, is now the top non-black midrange deck in Standard. <auto-card>Wedding Announcement</auto-card> and <auto-card>The Wandering Emperor</auto-card> are two of the most powerful cards in Standard, and the mono-color mana base allows you to exploit <auto-card>Lay Down Arms</auto-card> and <auto-card>Mishra's Foundry</auto-card> from <i>The Brothers' War</i>. The creature base, featuring <auto-card>Ambitious Farmhand</auto-card> and <auto-card>Spirited Companion</auto-card> in the two-drop slot, embarrasses opposing <auto-card>Cut Down</auto-card> or <auto-card>Invoke Despair</auto-card>, as you have no juicy <auto-card>Cut Down</auto-card> targets and you have enough sacrifice fodder for <auto-card>Invoke Despair</auto-card>.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Mono-Red_Aggro____eacaf448-9531-4076-a70f-a36d281e5c81===

<p>Mono-Red Aggro, at 6.4% of the winner's metagame, has surged after <i>The Brothers' War</i> added <auto-card>Monastery Swiftspear</auto-card>; <auto-card>Feldon, Ronom Excavator</auto-card>; and <auto-card>Mechanized Warfare</auto-card>. <auto-card>Obliterating Bolt</auto-card> for the sideboard didn't hurt either, and <auto-card>Mishra's Foundry</auto-card> is your payoff for staying mono-color. While Mono-Red Aggro is mostly about haste creatures and burn spells, the prowess mechanic is important as well. To reliably trigger <auto-card>Monastery Swiftspear</auto-card>, there's a playset of <auto-card>Reckless Impulse</auto-card>. <auto-card>Jaya, Fiery Negotiator</auto-card> has finally found a home as well.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Mardu_Midrange____c91e79b3-c6ba-430e-8492-ae765c2c4048===

<p>Mardu Midrange, at 5.5% of the record-weighted metagame, is a relatively new development. It exploits several new cards from <i>The Brothers' War</i> (<auto-card>Steel Seraph</auto-card>, <auto-card>Go for the Throat</auto-card>, and <auto-card>Battlefield Forge</auto-card>) but its main draw is <auto-card>Archangel of Wrath</auto-card>. The Archangel's enters-the-battlefield ability lines up extremely well against <auto-card>Bloodtithe Harvester</auto-card> and <auto-card>Fable of the Mirror-Breaker</auto-card> from Grixis Midrange. And even though Mardu doesn't have a tri-land, the color combination does provide appealing access to both <auto-card>Wedding Announcement</auto-card> and <auto-card>Fable of the Mirror-Breaker</auto-card>. Although there are versions that go deeper into black with <auto-card>Bloodtithe Harvester</auto-card> and the like, the more controlling version shown above merely splashes black for a bit of removal.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Azorius_Soldiers____92d8ab87-8833-416b-8a6a-32700623ba92===

<p><auto-card>Valiant Veteran</auto-card> was around before, but it was waiting for <i>The Brothers' War</i>. Now, there are enough powerful Soldiers to fill an entire competitive Standard deck. You can put a lot of pressure on your opponent with <auto-card>Recruitment Officer</auto-card> or <auto-card>Yotian Frontliner</auto-card> on turn one; <auto-card>Harbin, Vanguard Aviator</auto-card> on turn two; and <auto-card>Skystrike Officer</auto-card> or <auto-card>Siege Veteran</auto-card> on turn three. And with <auto-card>Fortified Beachhead</auto-card>, you have so many colored white and blue sources the inclusion of several <auto-card>Mishra's Foundry</auto-card> is even possible. Finally, since this is all-creature deck with token generators, <auto-card>In the Trenches</auto-card> is perfect for overwhelming your opponents.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Grixis_Sacrifice____e7222431-7633-4ec1-93a2-58453a275883===

<p><auto-card>Oni-Cult Anvil</auto-card> has been supercharged by two new blue cards from <i>The Brothers' War</i>: <auto-card>Third Path Iconoclast</auto-card> and <auto-card>Saheeli, Filigree Master</auto-card>. Their steady stream of artifact tokens fuels <auto-card>Oni-Cult Anvil</auto-card> and keeps the sacrifice synergies going. In addition, <auto-card>Mishra's Research Desk</auto-card> is like a better version of <auto-card>Experimental Synthesizer</auto-card>, as it digs deeper, gives you an additional turn to play the exiled card, and triggers <auto-card>Oni-Cult Anvil</auto-card> twice. Grixis Sacrifice is one of the many new Standard archetypes enabled by the latest expansion set.</p>

<h1>Modern with The Brothers' War</h1>

<p>To provide a metagame snapshot for <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/formats/modern" target="_blank">Modern</a>, I used all <a href="https://www.mtgo.com/en/mtgo/decklists" target="_blank"><i>Magic Online</i> decklists</a> from Modern Preliminary, Modern Challenge, Modern Last Chance, and Modern Showcase Qualifier events held from November 21 through December 12. I added all decklists with net positive records from Modern tournaments on <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklists/Modern" target="_blank">MTG Melee</a> from the same time period, plus all Top 8 decklists from the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mtgtournamentsbawu/posts/pfbid02tpk7TqEsG376AwUhwUmi1pfMgrqRmVaEmuuTKqmEU3htkmcFdkiz5z1wNJAVd64Fl" target="_blank">RCQ at Spielepyramide Karlsruhe</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/apex.gaming.esports/posts/pfbid0PcTc6sBTxvB5Y5WyKJrqNnBzmcDcmWigdUANttyFijy13BQSDzf44rrdeXutbyPrl" target="_blank">RCQ at Apex Gaming</a>, and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/4seasonsBologna/posts/pfbid09hwgxdk3dikRpV6U6qRvsnQVZBG493W6vbEQYrZMWtvY55VE8XvuT8pCw81B6tBXl" target="_blank">4Seasons Tournament</a>.</p>

<p>After correcting archetypes and assigning to each deck a number of points equal to its number of match wins minus its number of match losses, I derived the following record-weighted metagame breakdown. It may be interpreted as a winner's metagame that you can expect to see at the top tables. Archetype names hyperlink to a well-performing decklist closest to the aggregate of the archetype. Up and down arrows to signify the biggest changes compared to <a href="https://magic.gg/news/metagame-mentor-november-2022-standard-pioneer-and-modern-updates" target="_blank">my metagame roundup from early November</a>, right before the release of <i>The Brothers' War</i>.</p>

<p>With <auto-card>Yorion, Sky Nomad</auto-card> banned, Izzet Murktide, Hammer Time, and Rakdos Undying have emerged as the top-tier decks to beat. Meanwhile, Four/Five-Color Creativity has taken an enormous plunge, as opponents have gotten ready with <auto-card>Blood Moon</auto-card> or <auto-card>Orvar, the All-Form</auto-card>. Also, a new Jund Reanimator archetype has provided an alternative way to exploit <auto-card>Archon of Cruelty</auto-card>.</p>

<p>Indeed, the top 10 most-played new cards from <i>The Brothers' War</i> across my 944-decklist data set had a noticeable impact on the Modern format:</p>

<ul>
	<li><b><auto-card>Brotherhood's End</auto-card> (161 copies):</b> A reliable sweeper against aggro decks and artifact decks that excels against Hammer Time, where both modes are relevant. It's almost solely a sideboard card, most commonly seen in Izzet Murktide lists.</li>
	<li><b><auto-card>Haywire Mite</auto-card> (135 copies):</b> An efficient answer to troublesome permanents like <auto-card>Urza's Saga</auto-card> or <auto-card>Leyline Binding</auto-card>. As it serves as a tutor target, it's found a home in the main deck of <auto-card>Urza's Saga</auto-card> decks like <auto-card>Hardened Scales</auto-card> and Hammer Time. (The white-blue Hammer Time variant remains most prominent, but white-green is on the rise.) <auto-card>Haywire Mite</auto-card> is also seen in the sideboard of <auto-card>Chord of Calling</auto-card> decks like Yawgmoth and in the sideboard of <auto-card>Karn, the Great Creator</auto-card> decks like Mono-Green Tron. It has even empowered a brand new Insects archetype!</li>
	<li><b><auto-card>Bitter Reunion</auto-card> (113 copies):</b> An enabler for the card <auto-card>Persist</auto-card> that can immediately grant haste to <auto-card>Archon of Cruelty</auto-card> or <auto-card>Primeval Titan</auto-card>. It has found a home in several <auto-card>Indomitable Creativity</auto-card> decks and has fueled the new Jund Reanimator archetype.</li>
	<li><b><auto-card>The Stone Brain</auto-card> (81 copies):</b> A solid answer to single-card combos like <auto-card>Indomitable Creativity</auto-card>, <auto-card>Living End</auto-card>, or <auto-card>Scapeshift</auto-card>. As an artifact, <auto-card>The Stone Brain</auto-card> a big deal for all Tron decks with <auto-card>Karn, the Great Creator</auto-card>. Likewise, it's a great sideboard tool for decks with metalcraft or artifact synergies, such as Hammer Time and <auto-card>Hardened Scales</auto-card>.</li>
	<li><b><auto-card>Third Path Iconoclast</auto-card> (66 copies):</b> A massive improvement on <auto-card>Young Pyromancer</auto-card> because it synergizes with <auto-card>Mishra's Bauble</auto-card> and creates artifacts. <auto-card>Third Path Iconoclast</auto-card> has been doing a lot of work in Izzet Prowess, which has had a resurgence. It can also act as an alternative win condition in Jeskai Breach: A few decks have cut <auto-card>Thassa's Oracle</auto-card>, unlocked <auto-card>Jegantha, the Wellspring</auto-card> as a companion, and aim to win the game by sacrificing enough Soldier tokens to <auto-card>Grinding Station</auto-card> to mill out the opponent.</li>
	<li><b><auto-card>Mishra's Research Desk</auto-card> (34 copies):</b> A new value card that acts as a tutor target for <auto-card>Urza's Saga</auto-card>. The most prominent <auto-card>Urza's Saga</auto-card> decks where it has found a home are Jeskai Breach and newcomer Steelseeker Food.</li>
	<li><b><auto-card>Sarinth Steelseeker</auto-card> (30 copies):</b> A way to generate a lot of velocity for artifact-laden decks with graveyard synergies. It has spawned an entirely new archetype in Steelseeker Food.</li>
	<li><b><auto-card>Scrapwork Mutt</auto-card> (29 copies):</b> An enabler and a payoff for <auto-card>Sarinth Steelseeker</auto-card>. <auto-card>Scrapwork Mutt</auto-card> is almost solely seen in this new archetype.</li>
	<li><b><auto-card>Forging the Anchor</auto-card> (23 copies):</b> A sorcery that can potentially draw five cards for three mana. <auto-card>Forging the Anchor</auto-card> has revitalized Affinity.</li>
	<li><b><auto-card>Arcane Proxy</auto-card> (20 copes): </b>A way to cast suspend cards like <auto-card>Crashing Footfalls</auto-card> from the graveyard. <auto-card>Arcane Proxy</auto-card> has been included in various Rhinos decks.</li>
</ul>

<p>So these are the top new cards, but what do the new decks look like? If you last played Modern right before <i>The Brothers' War</i>, then the following five decklists should get you back up to speed.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Izzet_Prowess____85f606a8-5f09-4a8b-971e-4c29033a826c===

<p>Izzet Prowess, at 2.8% of the record-weighted metagame, has surged ahead since the release of <i>The Brothers' War</i>. The archetype takes advantage of the prowess mechanic on its creatures by playing a burst of cheap card draw spells and flashback spells. With a pair of <auto-card>Monastery Swiftspear</auto-card>s followed by a flurry of <auto-card>Mutagenic Growth</auto-card>s and <auto-card>Lava Dart</auto-card>s, a turn three kill is easily possible. Newcomer <auto-card>Third Path Iconoclast</auto-card> allows you to overrun your opponents with an army of tokens, and it's superior to <auto-card>Sprite Dragon</auto-card> when interactive grindy midrange decks form a large part of the metagame and raw explosiveness is not as essential.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Jund_Reanimator____40f314b5-746d-456b-8df6-ca394acf9d71===

<p>Jund Reanimator, at 2.1% of the winner's metagame, can lead with Thoughseize on turn one, discards <auto-card>Archon of Cruelty</auto-card> to <auto-card>Bitter Reunion</auto-card> on turn two, and casts a game-ending <auto-card>Persist</auto-card> on turn three. <auto-card>Bitter Reunion</auto-card> gives <auto-card>Archon of Cruelty</auto-card> haste, which means that you get two triggers right away. Another new card from <i>The Brothers' War</i>, <auto-card>Mishra's Command</auto-card>, offers an alternative way of getting <auto-card>Archon of Cruelty</auto-card> into your graveyard on turn two.</p>

<p>A few versions run <auto-card>Primeval Titan</auto-card> for redundancy, but it's more common to fit the reanimation angle in an <auto-card>Indomitable Creativity</auto-card> shell. As a Jund deck, it's more resilient against <auto-card>Blood Moon</auto-card> than the five-color builds with <auto-card>Leyline Binding</auto-card>. Perhaps this is only a temporary benefit, as I'm already seeing the trend of Izzet Murktide players moving away from <auto-card>Blood Moon</auto-card> and back towards <auto-card>Archmage's Charm</auto-card>, but Jund Reanimator has emerged as a major contender over the past few weeks.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Steelseeker_Food____e3d892e1-51c5-4b4e-8ec3-c20d57ba13b6===

<p>Steelseeker Food, at 1.2% of the record-weighted metagame, is AspiringSpike's latest innovation. The appetizing strategy revolves around the existing <auto-card>The Underworld Cookbook</auto-card> + <auto-card>Ovalchase Daredevil</auto-card> engine, which creates a pile of Food tokens. With those tokens, you can activate <auto-card>Asmoranomardicadaistinaculdacar</auto-card> or return <auto-card>Feasting Troll King</auto-card> from the graveyard. This engine got supercharged by <auto-card>Sarinth Steelseeker</auto-card> and <auto-card>Scrapwork Mutt</auto-card> from <i>The Brothers' War</i>.</p>

<p><auto-card>Sarinth Steelseeker</auto-card> is easily triggered by Underworld Cookbook, and it generates a relevant advantage if the top of your library provides a free land or an <auto-card>Ovalchase Daredevil</auto-card>, <auto-card>Feasting Troll King</auto-card>, or <auto-card>Scrapwork Mutt</auto-card> to send to the graveyard. <auto-card>Scrapwork Mutt</auto-card>, in turn, is a discard outlet for <auto-card>Asmoranomardicadaistinaculdacar</auto-card>, helps put <auto-card>Ovalchase Daredevil</auto-card> or <auto-card>Feasting Troll King</auto-card> into the graveyard, and synergizes with <auto-card>Sarinth Steelseeker</auto-card>. Besides these two main new tools, <i>The Brother's War</i> also offered <auto-card>Urza's Saga</auto-card> updates in the form of <auto-card>Mishra's Research Desk</auto-card> and <auto-card>Haywire Mite</auto-card>. I'm excited to see such a sweet new archetype put up numbers!</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Affinity____d585a0a1-6dc4-4701-bbda-743d3c13c9ec===

<p>Affinity has returned to the spotlight after <i>The Brothers' War</i> added <auto-card>Forging the Anchor</auto-card>. In the deck shown above, which is filled to the brim with artifacts, you will draw 3.6 cards on average, which is a pretty good deal for three mana. It means that you won't run out of gas and will control enough artifacts to cast <auto-card>Sojourner's Companion</auto-card> for free. I'm not sure if such a three-mana card draw spell is really what the archetype needed to succeed, but it's a fascinating addition nonetheless.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Insects____37450a4a-7d22-4a6c-9c0e-e1026aba9376===

<p>When I first looked at <auto-card>Haywire Mite</auto-card>, I quickly glanced over its creature type. "Insect, irrelevant," I thought. But as shown by CrusherBotBG on <i>Magic Online</i>, the creature type actually matters a lot. With <auto-card>Blex, Vexing Pest</auto-card> and <auto-card>Swarmyard</auto-card> as existing payoffs, <auto-card>Haywire Mite</auto-card> was the missing one-drop to elevate Insects to competitive viability. Decks like these show that Modern remains a brewer's paradise filled with possibilities.</p>

<h1>The Metagame and Win Rates</h1>

<p>Based on all decklists from the four Regional Championships held last weekend, I determined the combined metagame share of every archetype. I also calculated their non-mirror, non-bye, non-draw match win rates. I used my own algorithms and definitions to assign archetype labels, thereby sidestepping any potential mislabeling on MTG Melee. Let's take a look!</p>

<p>The most-played new-to-Pioneer cards from <i>The Brothers' War</i> were <auto-card>Misery's Shadow</auto-card>, <auto-card>Recruitment Officer</auto-card>, <auto-card>Brotherhood's End</auto-card>, <auto-card>Brushland</auto-card>, <auto-card>The Stone Brain</auto-card>, <auto-card>Obliterating Bolt</auto-card>, <auto-card>Cityscape Leveler</auto-card>, and <auto-card>Haywire Mite</auto-card>. These are the same top eight new cards as last week, albeit in a different order.</p>

<magic-cards>

  Bloodtithe Harvester
  Fable of the Mirror-Breaker
</magic-cards>

<p>Compared to the first Regional Championship weekend, the Pioneer metagame has shifted again. In terms of popularity, Mono-Green Devotion took a massive plunge, whereas Rakdos Midrange and Lotus Field combo surged ahead. In terms of win rates, Izzet Phoenix performed much, much worse than in the first weekend. Izzet Phoenix's poor performance was caused by the uptick in Lotus Field combo, which is a terrible matchup, and by the adoption of anti-graveyard cards in various main decks.</p>

<p>The big winners, in terms of both popularity and win rates, were Rakdos Midrange and Mono-White Humans. Rakdos Midrange came out ahead by tweaking its flex slots for the expected metagame, while Mono-White Humans preyed on the thrive of Lotus Field combo.</p>

<p>To give an indication of significance based on the sample size: the 95% confidence interval for Rakdos Midrange's win rate ranged from 49.8% to 56.1%. For Mono-White Humans, the data gives 95% confidence that its true win rate lies between 51.3% and 60.7%. (For the mathematically inclined: I used the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_proportion_confidence_interval#Clopper%E2%80%93Pearson_interval" target="_blank">Clopper-Person interval</a>.)</p>

<p>I expect that Mono-White Humans has one or two more good weekends ahead until the metagame adapts by increasing sweepers counts in sideboards. That would be a natural metagame development in what I consider to be a healthy, dynamic environment. In a similar vein, last weekend also saw the return of <auto-card>Damping Sphere</auto-card> in the sideboard of many Mono-Green Devotion lists as a way to combat the rise of Lotus Field combo. Although Pioneer features many powerful cards and engines, there are tools to beat everything, and the right configuration differs from weekend to weekend.</p>

<p>At the moment, Rakdos Midrange gained a target on its back. Indeed, the finals in both Australia and Japan featured a Rakdos Midrange mirror!</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/2SnyMgrgPwamX4djUxtGNt/813515710df5d1c9d9c364099fd1e8bd/Antony-Lee-Rakdos-Midrange.jpg" /></div></div><br />

<p>Anthony Lee won his finals against David Mines with a big brain play employing his knowledge of the rules. When both players control <auto-card>Sheoldred, the Apocalypse</auto-card>, the triggers go on the stack in APNAP (Active Player, Non-Active Player) order, which means that the trigger from the non-active player resolves first. So with David Mines at 4 life, Anthony Lee used <auto-card>Bonecrusher Giant</auto-card> // Stomp to put him down to 2 life, then passed the turn. Two Sheoldred triggers went on the stack in David Mines' draw step, and he briefly fell to 0 life, losing the game with his own life gain trigger still on the stack.</p>

<p>While such interaction knowledge is useful, the last few slots in your main deck can be an even bigger driver of success. For example, the widespread adoption of <auto-card>Misery's Shadow</auto-card> has made the Mono-Green Devotion matchup closer to even. And to reinforce my earlier point about Izzet Phoenix's poor performance: Both Rakdos Midrange champions had anti-graveyard cards in their main decks as a countermeasure—Anthony Lee had <auto-card>Unlicensed Hearse</auto-card>; Rei Hirayama had <auto-card>Go Blank</auto-card>.</p>

<p>The Top 8 of the Regional Championship for Japan/Korea also showed various interesting choices. For example, <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/259886" target="_blank">Shota Yasooka</a> stuck with <auto-card>Liliana of the Veil</auto-card>, which could be a great call if Selesnya Auras keeps rising in popularity. Meanwhile, <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/259369" target="_blank">Ryuji Murae</a> had <auto-card>Hazoret the Fervent</auto-card> and <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/254653" target="_blank">Masamasa Kyogoku</a> had <auto-card>Glorybringer</auto-card>, both of which are excellent in the mirror match. If Rakdos Midrange remains widely popular, then the cards that excel in the mirror match would be the best positioned, although that might provide a more hospitable environment for Izzet Phoenix.</p>

<p>Regardless of the direction, one thing is certain: The metagame will march ever onwards. Rakdos Midrange, like any archetype in Pioneer, is beatable. If it remains on top, then I'd expect players to flock towards <auto-card>Fires of Invention</auto-card>; <auto-card>Skysovereign, Consul Flagship</auto-card>; or other cards that line up well against Rakdos Midrange.</p>

<h1>Spice Corner</h1>

<p>Although the top tables at Pioneer tournaments will largely be populated by Rakdos Midrange, Mono-Green Devotion, Izzet Phoenix, Mono-White Humans, Azorius Control, and Abzan Greasefang, there are many other important metagame developments and brews to keep in mind. From among players who posted excellent records last weekend, most of which were good enough for a Pro Tour invite, several decks stand out as spicy choices.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/spiVOHFZerRMVMy2XOcgr/8cf8282e39bb71fef1e1946a8fd4d420/Chris-Cousens-Mono-Green-Aggro.jpg" /></div></div><br />

<p>Chris Cousens finished 12th at the Regional Championship in Sydney, Australia, good for a Pro Tour invite. Although his list features <auto-card>Llanowar Elves</auto-card>, <auto-card>Old-Growth Troll</auto-card>, and <auto-card>Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx</auto-card>, this is not your typical Mono-Green Devotion deck. Indeed, this is <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/260721" target="_blank">Mono-Green Aggro</a>.</p>

<p>Rather than ramping into <auto-card>Cavalier of Thorns</auto-card> and <auto-card>Storm the Festival</auto-card> and setting up convoluted <auto-card>Karn, the Great Creator</auto-card> loops, Cousens goes for the throat. <auto-card>Steel Leaf Champion</auto-card> provides a fast clock; <auto-card>Vivien, Arkbow Ranger</auto-card> is a more aggressive version of Karn; and <auto-card>Aspect of Hydra</auto-card> is a devotion payoff that can one-shot opponents. Meanwhile, Nykthos is still useful, for example to build a gigantic <auto-card>Lair of the Hydra</auto-card> or to cast <auto-card>Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger</auto-card>, which Vivien can grab from the sideboard.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/6qltOCSXVnhKFGTCyKOjKy/9edf4442b5161a97271cf47383ad3eab/Dmitry-Medvedev-Selesnya-Angels.jpg" /></div></div><br />

<p>Both Dmitry Medvedev and Alexey Shashov made the Top 8 of their Regional Championship in Singapore with the same 74-card <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/260529" target="_blank">Selesnya Angels</a> list. (Shashov had one <auto-card>Guardian of Faith</auto-card> in his sideboard instead of the second <auto-card>Brutal Cathar</auto-card>.)</p>

<p>Selesnya Angels has been on the rise ever since <i>The Brothers' War</i> added <auto-card>Brushland</auto-card> and <auto-card>Kayla's Reconstruction</auto-card> to the Pioneer format, and this continued in the second weekend of Regional Championships. Medvedev and Shashov also made several small tweaks. First, they added two additional <auto-card>Collected Company</auto-card> hits: <auto-card>Tomik, Distinguished Advokist</auto-card> is a two-drop that nullifies the power of <auto-card>Kiora, Behemoth Beckoner</auto-card>, while <auto-card>Lunarch Veteran</auto-card> is a one-drop that synergizes with <auto-card>Righteous Valkyrie</auto-card>. Their singleton <auto-card>Brave the Elements</auto-card> is also a clever choice in an open decklist format. Finally, <auto-card>Deafening Silence</auto-card> and <auto-card>Silence</auto-card> in the sideboard help fight back against Lotus Field combo. All in all, Selesnya Angels is establishing itself as a real contender in the Pioneer metagame, and these tweaks shore up some of the deck's weaknesses.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/5G6IyPE6CPfiHDIV4FQ1Ed/68abf7ea8266a193172d9d9ffd5c51d4/Kazuhiro-Kamata-Rakdos-Sacrifice.jpg" /></div></div><br />

<p>Kazuhiro Kamata earned a Pro Tour invitation with his 15th-place finish at the Regional Championship in Aichi, Japan. He chose to play <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/259901" target="_blank">Rakdos Sacrifice</a> with a tiny green splash because he believed he had a good matchup against Rakdos Midrange and Green Devotion. The matchup against Izzet Phoenix might be rough, but that shouldn't be a problem if that archetype is on the downturn.</p>

<p>Kamata's list features a sweet combo: two main deck copies of <auto-card>Kari Zev's Expertise</auto-card> along with two copies of <auto-card>Diabolic Intent</auto-card>. Just imagine stealing <auto-card>Old-Growth Troll</auto-card> and sacrificing it to search for a missing piece of the <auto-card>Witch's Oven</auto-card> + <auto-card>Cauldron Familiar</auto-card> + <auto-card>Mayhem Devil</auto-card> engine. That's pretty powerful indeed. He also has a singleton <auto-card>Korvold, Fae-Cursed King</auto-card> as a tutor target, which he can cast via Treasures or two green dual lands. Kamata felt that <auto-card>Kari Zev's Expertise</auto-card> was more powerful than access to <auto-card>Jegantha, the Wellspring</auto-card>, and he even managed to steal his opponent's <auto-card>Skysovereign, Consul Flagship</auto-card> one game.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/5WYRqRD2XwzYMGFkz0FiS7/6171e8f0d170abdae4864198d6156870/Kazuya-Kiyofuji-Azorius-Control.jpg" /></div></div><br />

<p>Kazuya Kiyofuji made the Top 8 at the Regional Championship in Aichi, Japan with a variation on Azorius Control that I would describe as <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/259887" target="_blank">Azorius Lotus Field</a>. With <auto-card>Strict Proctor</auto-card> and <auto-card>Discontinuity</auto-card>, you can annul the enters-the-battlefield tax, which means that you won't have to sacrifice two lands to <auto-card>Lotus Field</auto-card>. This allows you to ramp into <auto-card>Teferi, Hero of Dominaria</auto-card> or <auto-card>Shark Typhoon</auto-card> ahead of time.</p>

<p>His list also features a new addition from <i>The Brothers' War</i> in the form of <auto-card>Soul Partition</auto-card>. It may be only temporary removal, but that's all you need when your late game is superior. Also, if you exile <auto-card>Cavalier of Thorns</auto-card> while controlling <auto-card>Strict Proctor</auto-card>, your opponent suddenly needs nine total mana if they want to benefit from Cavalier's enters-the-battlefield trigger.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/1BLD0VzWaQknzfYGtGPF3U/ec87e079b16cd138f2568dadf211f5b8/Hidenari-Ikeda-Esper-Control.jpg" /></div></div><br />

<p>Hidenari Ikeda earned a Pro Tour invitation with his 15th-place finish at the Regional Championship in Aichi, Japan. While Azorius Control and Dimir Control have been the more typical choices for control decks in Pioneer, he proved the viability of <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/258576" target="_blank">Esper Control</a>. The third color comes at the cost of more tapped lands, but the mana base is good enough overall.</p>

<p>Running all three colors provides clear benefits. Blue is of course a necessity for control players, as it offers countermagic and card draw. Black offers the most efficient spot removal in <auto-card>Fatal Push</auto-card> and the best sweeper in <auto-card>Extinction Event</auto-card>, which is superior to <auto-card>Supreme Verdict</auto-card> in the present metagame because it exiles <auto-card>Old-Growth Troll</auto-card> and <auto-card>Cavalier of Thorns</auto-card>. White offers the best win conditions in <auto-card>The Wandering Emperor</auto-card> and <auto-card>Teferi, Hero of Dominaria</auto-card>. With Esper Control, you have it all.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/2T8YmrNKhOoe1spbtFbP48/5a6c2562a4dc8af22c6532718255002f/Liam-Hoban-Dimir-Oracle.jpg" /></div></div><br />

<p>Although Liam Hoban's 10-4 record may not have been enough for a Pro Tour invite, he made a deep run with a spicy new <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/260915" target="_blank">Dimir Oracle</a> brew, potentially inspired by the deck that won the <a href="https://www.mtgo.com/en/mtgo/decklist/pioneer-challenge-2022-11-1912495570" target="_blank">November 19 Pioneer Challenge</a>.</p>

<p>Fueled by <auto-card>Fallaji Archaeologist</auto-card> from <i>The Brothers' War</i>, the game plan is to mill or exile your entire library as quickly as possible and then win by casting <auto-card>Thassa's Oracle</auto-card>. Once you start to chain <auto-card>Demonic Bargain</auto-card>s, your library will disappear rapidly, although the process is still more convoluted than in the days of <auto-card>Inverter of Truth</auto-card>. Deck development like these prove that Pioneer remains underexplored, with plenty of wild options ready to be discovered.</p>

<h1>Looking Ahead</h1>

<p>The schedule for the remaining Regional Championships in this first round is as follows:</p>

</ul>

<p>To follow along this coming weekend, bookmark the MTG Melee pages of the <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Tournament/View/12465" target="_blank">Regional Championship for Chinese Taipei</a> and the <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Tournament/View/13040" target="_blank">Regional Championship for South America</a>.</p>

<p>Looking ahead even further, in about ten months from now, <i>Magic</i> World Championship XXIX will be held on September 22-24, 2023 at MagicCon: Las Vegas. The field of competitors, who will vie for the total prize pool of $1,000,000, currently features:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Sam Rolph and Keisuke Sato (the top 2 finishers at <a href="https://magic.gg/events/arena-championship-1" target="_blank">Arena Championship 1</a>)</li>
	<li>Nathan Steuer and Kiran Dhokia (the top 2 finishers at the <a href="https://magic.gg/events/2022-magic-online-champions-showcase-season-2" target="_blank">2022 MOCS season 2</a>)</li>
	<li>Nathan Steuer, Eli Kassis, Jakub Tóth, and Karl Sarap (the top 4 finishers from <a href="https://magic.gg/events/magic-world-championship-xxviii" target="_blank">this year's World Championship</a>, qualifying Nathan Steuer for the second time)</li>

	<li>Michael Martin Go (the winner of <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Tournament/View/12857" target="_blank">the first Regional Championship for Southeast Asia</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>The field will be extended to around 128 players based on the results from subsequent championships and Pro Tours in the 2022-23 season. Detailed invite criteria can be found <a href="https://magic.gg/news/return-of-the-pro-tour-details" target="_blank">here</a>. But no matter where you're from, you'll have your regional champions to cheer for.</p>

<p>Although <i>Magic</i> World Championship XXIX is still almost a full year away, the excitement is already building up for the competitors. As Anthony Lee said after winning his Regional Championship: "I'm really excited. I've gotten to be on some Worlds testing teams the last few years, helping out [2018 World Champion] Javier Dominguez, who was invaluable by the way in helping me get here of course. And it's gonna be really exciting to be able to be the one competing. Right now I know Nathan Steuer and Sam Rolph are already qualified. We teamed with them for the [New Capenna Championship] so I know they're way better than me, but I hope that with Javier's help, we can bridge the gap."</p>

<p>High-level tabletop <i>Magic</i> is back. The passion and fire for in-person <i>Magic</i> tournaments shone through at the Regional Championships last weekend, and many players paved their paths to the Pro Tour. Moreover, with every subsequent event, the field for next year's World Championship is starting to firm up with more great talent.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>F2F Tour Championship: Calgary Final Standings</title><link>https://magic.gg/news/f2f-tour-championship-calgary-final-standings</link><guid>https://magic.gg/news/f2f-tour-championship-calgary-final-standings</guid><description><![CDATA[<data-table os="Windows" data-id="5tvubm7cMGRyJhnwC5Dg56"></data-table>]]></description></item><item><title>The Week That Was: Making It To The Big Stage</title><link>https://magic.gg/news/the-week-that-was-making-it-to-the-big-stage</link><guid>https://magic.gg/news/the-week-that-was-making-it-to-the-big-stage</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>I want to start this week by peeling back the curtain a little bit. We're deep into the Regional Championship season across the world, and that means there's a lot that comes across my desk week-to-week (or <a href="https://twitter.com/Chosler" target="_blank">my Twitter</a>, anyway). There are more stories in <i>Magic</i> than we'll ever be able to cover, even with the return of The Week That Was.</p>

<p>But we're going to try anyway.</p>

<p>Across the world thousands of players are convening, for one of the first times in years, for high-level tabletop <i>Magic</i> everywhere you can find tables to sleeve up sixty. For me, that means a schedule of events and winners to follow, all the way up to and through 2023. By the time we reach <i>Magic</i> World Championship XXIX later next year, we'll have a large field of players, some of whom you may not have heard of.</p>

<p>But for those following the developments across the world (and the world of <i>Magic),</i> you'll begin to recognize names – even if they aren't always the winners. With so much happening, there's a <i>lot</i> of players fulfilling a dream who may not make it into the headlines – so today we're going to cover a handful of stories from across the globe.</p>

<h1>Two Regional Championships Crown Victors</h1>

<p>Let's start with a look at last week's events.</p>

<p>We had Regional Championships taking place in South America and Asia, with the <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Tournament/View/13040" target="_blank">South America <i>Magic</i> Series</a> taking place in Santiago and the <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Tournament/View/12465" target="_blank">MIT Championship</a>, respectively. They come on the heels of a month of high-level Pioneer Regional Championship play, and as the season has gone on the format has continued to evolve, a constantly shifting target for those competing in later weekends. A format that at the outset looked to be dominated by <auto-card>Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx</auto-card> and Mono-Green Devotion has instead revealed itself as an open format with some mainstays but altogether more possibilities than imagined before the season.</p>

<p>That played perfectly for Alejandro Sepúlveda, who surprised the field with Mono-Red Aggro and stormed his way through the field en route to a finals where he faced down another surprise deck: Dimir Control in the hands of Julian Prado. (Check out <a href="https://magic.gg/news/metagame-mentor-pioneer-at-the-south-america-and-chinese-taipei-regional-championships" target="_blank">Frank's column for more on the decks and the Pioneer metagame</a>!) It was the culmination of an event with more than 200 players from across the continent gathering to compete for a spot at the first Pro Tour of 2023 and the World Championship. The buzz to get back to the Pro Tour brought out the best in the region, and the Top 8 featured a number of accomplished competitors including <a href="https://www.magic.gg/news/a-champions-path-back-to-magic" target="_blank">former Mythic Champion Mattias Leveratto</a>. With the win, Sepúlveda secures both a Pro Tour invite as well as guaranteeing himself a seat at the World Championship, and he heads there with momentum.</p>

<p>Over in New Tapei City, 55 players competed until Jim Tim Lee found himself atop the field with his trusted Rakdos Midrange deck (Rakdos has been the most consistent performer in Pioneer, despite the lack of hype around the deck entering the season). Lee described his deck choice as a "if you can't beat 'em, join 'em," mentality, and it's hard to argue with the undefeated results that stratagem yielded him. But even with the ubiquitous Rakdos winning the event, it had to go through a surprise Esper Control brew in the finals to get there.</p>

<h1>Victories Large (And Small)</h1>

<p>My job here is to share the path to the Pro Tour. And I take that somewhat literally – the road to the Pro Tour doesn't begin in the finals of a big PTQ or on Friday of the tournament or in deck selection the week before, or testing houses and Discords and all the rest.</p>

<p>It begins, like many great things, at the table with friends.</p>

<p>Not everyone will qualify for the Regional Championship and find unburdened success in front of them. But what can sometimes get lost in a week-to-week, Top 8-to-Top 8 world is that by the time you read about a player doing well in a particular tournament, odds are they've been steadfastly grinding away for years to improve their game and level up their results. That's one of the reasons Brian David-Marshall (the mainstay author of The Week That Was in years past) gave me this piece of advice when I picked up the column: highlight players at every stage of their journey. If the first time I'm introducing you to a winner is when they're lifting the trophy, then I've probably missed something along the way.</p>

<p>That's why I love stories like this one, which are told over and over again on the way to the Pro Tour.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">My teammate <a href="https://twitter.com/BlitzMTG?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@BlitzMTG</a> and I played in the finals in the store were sponsored in and seeing how excited he was and how much work he had put into his deck to win was worth the loss tbh</p>&mdash; Austin Olet (@AustinOlet) <a href="https://twitter.com/AustinOlet/status/1599864492346683392?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 5, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Whether it's in the finals of the PT or the finals of FNM at Knight of Thorn in Watertown, New York, this is what the path to the Pro Tour looks like – it's a journey with different destinations for everyone, but we're all along for the same ride. I think back to my own competitive <i>Magic</i> accomplishments those matches where I was a game away from the Pro Tour for the first time. For me, the path to the Pro Tour was a gateway to what I really dreamed of doing: coverage. For friends meeting in the finals of the PTQ, that's what the path to the Pro Tour looks like. For Leveratto, it was a whirlwind of <i>Magic</i> after returning home from abroad in the last weekend of qualifiers. For Anthony Lee, it was years of dedicated assistance for teammates qualified for tournaments he wasn't – and they paid back the favor as he <a href="https://magic.gg/news/the-week-that-was-many-hands-make-qualifying-light-work" target="_blank">lived out those dreams himself at his Regional Championship</a>. Every weekend, Pro Tour dreams are being made and it's been a blast to follow.</p>

<p>As we sit near the midpoint of the Regional Championship schedule, it felt like a good time to step back and remember that while we're chasing spicy decks and trophy winners (and with good reason!), the stories don't stop with the Top 8, and the ranks of the Pro Tour and World Championship in 2023 – and truthfully the future of competitive <i>Magic</i> overall – are being filled in at X-3 brackets across the world.</p>

<h1>All Roads Lead to Philly</h1>

<p>All roads lead to <a href="https://magic30.mtgfestivals.com/en-us/home.html" target="_blank">MagicCon: Philadelphia</a>, where the hundreds of players from across the world proving right now that they belong with the best in the business will have their opportunity to take the next step at the Pro Tour. Philadelphia, of course, is famous for being <a href="https://magic.gg/news/the-week-that-was-miranda-masters-modern" target="_blank">home to the first Modern Pro Tour</a>, which was a major step forward for competitive <i>Magic</i> (not to mention one of the most entertaining <i>Magic</i> events I've ever watched), so it's fitting that it will be home to the return of the paper Pro Tour. That event will kickstart a yearlong run to the World Championship, and the field – which already includes <a href="https://magic.gg/news/the-week-that-was-the-greatest-steuer-ever-told" target="_blank">reigning World Champ Nathan Steuer</a> along with Eli Kassis, Karl Sarap, and Jakub Tóth (the rest of the Top 4 at <a href="https://magic.gg/events/magic-world-championship-xxviii" target="_blank"><i>Magic</i> World Championship XXVIII</a>. The list is growing all the time, with Jim Tim Lee and Alejandro Sepúlveda adding their names this week. <a href="https://magic.gg/news/metagame-mentor-pioneer-at-the-south-america-and-chinese-taipei-regional-championships" target="_blank">Frank has the most up-to-date list here</a>.</p>

<p>So what does all of that mean, here at the midway point of the RC season? From where I'm sitting, at least, the fire for the Pro Tour is back. Seeing teams of players regroup in person after months or years apart with meaningful tournaments to play in has been frankly really reinvigorating after years of online events.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Not an underdog story but watching <a href="https://twitter.com/misplacedginger?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@misplacedginger</a> put in a ton of effort in the RB deck streaming month after month.

<p>Navigating this season along with Frank, our field reporters and editorial staff has been the most plugged-in to a <i>Magic</i> season I've ever been, and between you and me that's saying something. The vibe I've gotten from most players has been similar, and the continued evolution of Pioneer has been a story in itself. In short, the blueprint is here, and personally I'm excited as hell for what 2023 has to bring for competitive <i>Magic.</i> And I'm not the only one – fun fact: shortly before I sat down to write this, I just got my clock cleaned by Jean-Emmanuel Depraz in <i>The Brothers' War</i> Sealed on <i>MTG Arena.</i> Seriously, is there <i>anywhere</i> that guy isn't at winning matches?</p>

<h1>Looking Ahead</h1>

<p>The holidays approach, and with a handful of Regional Championships left to play, we turn next to Canada, where the second championship of the season is on tap. The Eastern Canada Regional Championship got things rolling two weeks ago, with Christian Trudel <a href="https://www.magic.gg/news/christian-trudel-wins-big-at-torontos-f2f-tour" target="_blank">taking down the FacetoFace Tour Weekend</a> with Mono-Green Devotion.</p>

<p>There are more World Championship seats on the line when players get their shot this weekend at the <a href="https://f2ftour.com/event/f2f-tour-weekend-calgary-2022/" target="_blank">Championship</a> in Calgary, Alberta. Following that we move to the Mexico/Central America/Caribbean Regional Championship before closing out 2022.

<p>You can find the Top 8 bracket, photos, and more on the <a href="https://stage.magic.gg/events/south-america-magic-series-santiago" target="_blank">South American Regional Championship coverage page</a>.</p>

<p>Competition was fierce, with 203 players in attendance to vie for four total invitations to the Pro Tour. The region-dependent number of Pro Tour invites was determined by Wizards of the Coast in early 2022; the specific structure and number of Regional Championship Qualifiers is set by Magicsur Chile. It's great to see the passion of the South American <i>Magic</i> community as many players enthusiastically traveled to compete against the best players in their region.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/5Qxu0GCdlgb6WLOD8pToTm/3b05523745f51ff23f47ba9ded745c26/1920x1000-Alejandro-Sepulveda-MonoRed-Aggro.jpg" /></div></div><br />

<p>Mono-Red Aggro hadn't put up notable results in recent weeks. But with his victory, Alejandro Sepúlveda put it back on the map. "I have a lot of experience with the deck so I was locked on [Red Deck Wins]," he said when asked about his reasons for choosing the deck. "I think that experience can give me a greater edge than playing a better deck I don't know how to play."</p>

<p>Sepúlveda's list offers both board presence and burn. <auto-card>Hazoret the Fervent</auto-card> is excellent against Rakdos Midrange, as it's hard to answer and helps push through <auto-card>Sheoldred, the Apocalypse</auto-card>. The constant fear of <auto-card>Embercleave</auto-card> is also very real, yet Sepúlveda doesn't go all-in on the legendary equipment with cards like <auto-card>Burning-Tree Emissary</auto-card> and <auto-card>Anax, Hardened in the Forge</auto-card>. Rather, he retains a healthy dose of burn spells, supported by <auto-card>Eidolon of the Great Revel</auto-card> and <auto-card>Rampaging Ferocidon</auto-card> to put additional pressure on the opponent's life total.</p>

<p>"During testing I noticed that <auto-card>Rampaging Ferocidon</auto-card> lines up really well vs most of the meta," he said. "The dino dodges <auto-card>Fatal Push</auto-card>, <auto-card>Bloodtithe Harvester</auto-card>, and <auto-card>Bonecrusher Giant</auto-card> and forces your opponent to follow tricky lines where they stop attacking to leave up blockers that usually end up getting bolted."</p>

<p>His sideboard has some spice as well. As he explained, <auto-card>Leyline of Combustion</auto-card> is "your best card" against Rakdos Midrange and Izzet Phoenix. "They can't interact with it; see it as some sort of one-sided <auto-card>Eidolon of the Great Revel</auto-card>." Sepúlveda's experience with the deck allowed him to pick the right cards for the metagame, and it paid off!</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Congratulations as well to Jim Tim Lee, winner of Chinese Taipei&#39;s Regional Championship!<br><br>He took down the tournament with Rakdos Midrange, earning seats at Pro Tour I and the World Championship! <a href="https://t.co/cK0F9bw39X">pic.twitter.com/cK0F9bw39X</a></p>&mdash; PlayMTG (@PlayMTG) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayMTG/status/1599549615098892288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 4, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

===decklistId:Rakdos_Midrange_Jim_Tim_Lee_MIT_Championship_12_3_2022_3fce2c3c-bb26-49d6-8a6f-a6b7a8c29f62===

<p>"If you can't beat them, join them!" Jim Tim Lee explained. Indeed, Rakdos Midrange had been the most popular deck archetype in <a href="https://www.magic.gg/news/metagame-mentor-the-quadruple-regional-championship-weekend" target="_blank">the preceding Regional Championships weekend</a>, and that trend continued globally.</p>

<p>His build, which went undefeated throughout the tournament, is a near-exact copy of Rei Hirayama's list that won the Japan/Korea Regional Championship. <auto-card>Go Blank</auto-card> in the main deck surely helped in beating Izzet Phoenix. The only difference was Jim Tim Lee's use of <auto-card>Canyon Slough</auto-card> instead of the second Swamp. This increases the likelihood of drawing a perfect mix of lands and spells.</p>

<h1>The Metagame and Win Rates</h1>

<p>Based on all decklists from both Regional Championships held last weekend, I determined the combined metagame share of every archetype. I also calculated their non-mirror, non-bye, non-draw match win rates. I used my own algorithms and definitions to assign archetype labels, thereby sidestepping any potential mislabeling on MTG Melee. Let's take a look!</p>

The "Other" category included such deck archetypes as <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/262263" target="_blank">Bant Humans</a>, <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/262301" target="_blank">Rakdos Creativity</a>, <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/262132" target="_blank">Mono-Red Wizards</a>, <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/262088" target="_blank">Mono-Blue Control</a>, <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/262229" target="_blank">Izzet Dragons</a>, <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/262385" target="_blank">Jund Sacrifice</a>, <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/262395" target="_blank">Orzhov Midrange</a>, <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/262308" target="_blank">Bard Class</a>, <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/262280" target="_blank">Elves</a>, <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/262396" target="_blank">Abzan Deathtouch</a>, and <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/262250" target="_blank">Selesnya Auras</a>.</p>

<p>The overall metagame was quite similar to <a href="https://www.magic.gg/news/metagame-mentor-the-quadruple-regional-championship-weekend" target="_blank">the one from the preceding weekend</a>. The most notable difference is an uptick in both Mono-White Humans and Azorius Control. While these decks look to be on an upward trend, sample sizes for the number of players and number of matches were relatively small. So it's hard to draw significant conclusions about either popularity or performance. Indeed, most of the winrates were not different from 50-50 in a statistically significant sense.</p>

<p>Except for Mono-Green Devotion, which fell flat despite being heavily played. One reason for this, based on comparing aggregate decklists from last weekend to the ones from the weekend before, is that many players are making small tweaks to improve their deck against Mono-Green Devotion. For example, many Rakdos Midrange players have added <auto-card>Pithing Needle</auto-card> to their sideboards to stop planeswalkers. Combined with pressure from <auto-card>Misery's Shadow</auto-card>, the right build of Rakdos Midrange may now actually be favored against Mono-Green Devotion.</p>

<p>Likewise, many Mono-White Humans players added main deck <auto-card>Tomik, Distinguished Advokist</auto-card> to stop <auto-card>Kiora, Behemoth Beckoner</auto-card>, and many Azorius Control players increased their <auto-card>Field of Ruin</auto-card> count to destroy <auto-card>Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx</auto-card>. Tomik, <auto-card>Field of Ruin</auto-card>, and <auto-card>Pithing Needle</auto-card> all answer <auto-card>Thespian's Stage</auto-card> as well, thereby providing splash damage against the <auto-card>Lotus Field</auto-card> combo decks. Even though <auto-card>Lotus Field</auto-card> combo <a href="https://twitter.com/CainRianhard/status/1599502466826895362/photo/2" target="_blank">won the Showcase Qualifier</a> on <i>Magic</i> Online, it didn't have a good weekend at the Regional Championships.</p>

<h1>Rise and Success of Anti-Rakdos Decks</h1>

<p>Rakdos Midrange remains the most popular archetype, but like any archetype in Pioneer, it's beatable. More and more players are flocking towards cards or strategies that line up well against Rakdos Midrange, and many found success last weekend.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/1pxASN4scrWeZBO8VIcF2o/468de469acacc8aac58f2f68fd4aafca/1920x1000-Julian-Prado-Dimir-Control.jpg" /></div></div><br />

<p>One of the biggest new developments to come out of the Regional Championship in Santiago de Chile was that two players with nearly the same <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/262277" target="_blank">Dimir Control</a> deck did exceedingly well. Andrés Camargo narrowly missed Top 8 at 6-2, while Julian Prado made the finals and earned a Pro Tour invite.</p>

<p>The unique element in their list is four copies of <auto-card>Day's Undoing</auto-card>. When you control <auto-card>Narset, Parter of Veils</auto-card> or <auto-card>Notion Thief</auto-card>, the symmetry is broken—you get a fresh hand of seven new cards while your opponent receives only one or zero cards. You can be the ultimate villain by first bouncing one of their creatures with <auto-card>Rona's Vortex</auto-card>, then forcing your opponent to draw a card via the alternate cost on <auto-card>Baleful Mastery</auto-card>, and finally casting <auto-card>Day's Undoing</auto-card>. This leaves them with nothing. Then, immediately after they draw a card in their draw step, you activate <auto-card>Geier Reach Sanitarium</auto-card>, effectively locking the opponent out of the game.</p>

<p>The two players on this version of Dimir Midrange went 5-0 against Rakdos Midrange in the Swiss, which is certainly promising. Their lists were extremely similar, with only a few small differences: Andrés Camargo had a third Island and an <auto-card>Urborg, Tomb of Yawgmoth</auto-card> instead of a second <auto-card>Fetid Pools</auto-card> and a second Swamp in the main deck, as well as <auto-card>Sheoldred, the Apocalypse</auto-card> instead of <auto-card>Kaervek, the Spiteful</auto-card> in the sideboard. I'm interested to see if this brew from South America will catch on globally.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/2nsqlX8xIrm5amaQjurX7D/7334635a2540ab0f1838666be480244d/1920x1000-Joaquin-Maletti-Enigmatic-Fires.jpg" /></div></div><br />

<p>Another major story to come out of the Regional Championship in Santiago de Chile was that there were two copies of <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/262462" target="_blank">Enigmatic Fires</a> in the Top 8. Luis Mesa lost the quarterfinals, whereas Joaquin Maletti made it to the semifinals. The archetype preys on Rakdos Midrange because effects like <auto-card>Back to Nature</auto-card> or <auto-card>Erase</auto-card> are not available in red or black, so Rakdos decks are traditionally weak to enchantments.</p>

<p>In Pioneer, <auto-card>Enigmatic Incarnation</auto-card> and <auto-card>Fires of Invention</auto-card> are some of the most powerful enchantments available, and they can overpower Rakdos Midrange opponents with ease. Whether it's fetching <auto-card>Titan of Industry</auto-card> on turn four or casting a free <auto-card>Kenrith, the Returned King</auto-card> with activation mana up, Enigmatic Fires will be well-positioned as long as Rakdos Midrange remains the most popular deck in Pioneer.</p>

<p>Joaquin Maletti's version features <auto-card>Oath of Chandra</auto-card> instead of <auto-card>Trial of Ambition</auto-card>. This is superior for mana base reasons, as black is basically a splash and it's easier to cast <auto-card>Oath of Chandra</auto-card> on turn two.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/29VAmZTSpsRCd304Vz3Vtk/f4c802e8d52ee2aa73b82ca90390126a/1920x1000-Matias-Leveratto-Rakdos-Sacrifice.jpg" /></div></div><br />

<p>Rakdos Sacrifice is another archetype that lines up well against Rakdos Midrange. The <auto-card>Mayhem Devil</auto-card> + <auto-card>Witch's Oven</auto-card> + <auto-card>Cauldron Familiar</auto-card> engine will often bury them in the late game, and if they try to generate early-game card advantage by Stomping one of your creatures, you'll just sacrifice it to <auto-card>Deadly Dispute</auto-card>. <auto-card>Claim the Firstborn</auto-card> and <auto-card>Kari Zev's Expertise</auto-card> also cleanly answer <auto-card>Misery's Shadow</auto-card> and <auto-card>Sheoldred, the Apocalypse</auto-card>, provided you have a sacrifice outlet.</p>

<p>2019 Mythic Championship winner Matias Leveratto put his faith in Rakdos Sacrifice, and his Top 4 finish at the South America Regional Championship earned him a Pro Tour invite.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/7y2T9p64x6d4qLwMPPXTlP/9b3a026e33de8b32466e1163369b7923/1920x1000-Manuel-Sinforoso-Gruul-Vehicles.jpg" /></div></div><br />

<p>Finally, a section on ways to beat Rakdos Midrange wouldn't be complete without mentioning the best <auto-card>Skysovereign, Consul Flagship</auto-card> deck: Gruul Vehicles. It had the highest win rate against the field out of all the top-tier archetypes, and it's one of the most reliable ways to crush Rakdos Midrange.</p>

<p>Manuel Sinforoso made the Top 8 at the South America Regional Championship with his version of Gruul Vehicles. His main deck features a few copies of <auto-card>Lightning Strike</auto-card> and <auto-card>Fable of the Mirror-Breaker</auto-card>, which provide a lower curve compared to the stock version that maxes out on <auto-card>The Akroan War</auto-card>. Sinforoso's sideboard features a little bit of everything; <auto-card>Cindervines</auto-card> is rising in popularity, and <auto-card>Glorybringer</auto-card> is great against midrange decks.</p>

<p>As long as Rakdos Midrange remains on top, Gruul Vehicles will be a solid choice, and Sinforoso's list is a good place to start.</p>

<h1>Looking Ahead</h1>

<p>The schedule for the remaining Regional Championships in this first round is as follows:</p>

They played eight rounds of Pioneer before cutting to the Top 8, where Alejandro Sepulveda, piloting Mono-Red Aggro, emerged victorious. He earned invites to both Pro Tour I in Philadelphia, as well as the World Championship. Congratulations to Alejandro Sepulveda, South America's Regional Champion!</p>

<p>Sepulveda defeated Julian Prado in a finals match that reflected the wide open Pioneer metagame. Sepulveda's offbeat choice of Mono-Red Aggro was matched by Prado's own pick of Dimir Control, both decks that haven't made much of an impression on the metagame in the past two weekends of Regional Championships.</p>

# CONGRATULATIONS TO THE MIT CHAMPIONSHIP TOP 8

The MIT Championship had one of the most interesting sets of Top 8 decklists from a Regional Championship yet. Mono-White Humans made huge gains, putting three copies into the Top 8, while the increasingly popular Rakdos Midrange and the surprise Esper Control were represented in the finals.

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/1kyw8dj7eKuC1GvJGgJ9rW/5c4641782aa020c19659d62d9f8143e2/mit-top8.jpg" /><p class="embedImageCaption">MIT Champs Top 8 Group, caption: The MIT Championship Top 8: Cheng Yu Chang, Tsai ChingChi, Tzujui Huang, ChengHsun Lin, Josh Zhen, Shu-Yu Hsueh, Jim Tim Lee, and Se̍k-Un Khó</p></div></div><br />

Lee taking down the tournament with Rakdos Midrange reflects the deck's increasing popularity in the Pioneer metagame. It, along with Mono-White Humans, has seen some of the biggest gains since the opening weekend of Regional Championships in the middle of November.

<p>With the kickoff for <i>Magic</i>'s 30th anniversary celebrations in the books, we're turning our attention to MagicCon, our new festival event series that further celebrates <i>Magic</i> four more times in 2023. <i>Magic</i> 30 was an amazing experience with 10,000 attendees, and we're making our gathering in Philadelphia even better!</p>

<p>Below, you'll find the details for MagicCon: Philadelphia, many of the ways in which we're looking to improve the experience, a schedule for the other MagicCon events in 2023, and the return and expansion of the New Perspectives grant program!</p>

<p>Tickets go on sale December 1 at <a href="https://mtgfestivals.com/" target="_blank">mtgfestivals.com</a>. In the meantime, read further to learn more information on:</p>

<h1>MagicCon: Philadelphia Experience Updates</h1>

<p>The first stop on the MagicCon tour in 2023 is Philadelphia, the "City of Brotherly Love" and home to Reading Terminal Market (important for visitors—and me). Taking place February 17–19, MagicCon: Philadelphia will feature the first Pro Tour of the year, exclusive events like the new <i>Secret Lair</i> Showdown (more on this below), and the immersive experience fans loved at <i>Magic</i> 30.</p>

<p>We've also taken lessons and your feedback from <i>Magic</i> 30 to improve the attendee experience. While <i>Magic</i> 30 was an unforgettable experience, it was also our first event of this kind <i>and</i> our first live event since the pandemic shut down "the gathering" nearly three years ago. We learned quite a bit from the event and are making some improvements that we think will make Philadelphia even better.</p>

<p>If you prefer information in video form, Director of Play Programs Billy Jensen was recently on Weekly MTG to discuss what we learned from <i>Magic</i> 30, how we're making the experience in Philadelphia even better, and detailing more about our Premier Play programs.</p>

<embed-iframe fallback-img="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/1InItYKoxcVOIjCrA6aO4L/90673d36527a279cbfcb2c4450b31e2f/1920x1080-Weekly-MTG-Thumb-20221110.jpg" has-consent="true"   width="950" height="534" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/br5GczP7v30" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></embed-iframe>

<p>The first big change is just that: Philadelphia will be big, as in <i>double the space from Las Vegas</i>. At <i>Magic</i> 30, the entire event fit into 220,000 square feet. In Philadelphia, we're going to have more than 450,000 square feet, all at the Pennsylvania Convention Center! (This is why we moved the event to Philadelphia from originally announced Charlotte—we couldn't get this much space in Charlotte.) For attendees that's more play space, more event space, and more Command Zone.</p>

<p>For the Command Zone specifically, it was a hot topic over the <i>Magic</i> 30 weekend as we adapted the experience. Players played Commander wherever they could around the hall, and we heard the feedback loud and clear that attendees wanted the Command Zone experience for every badge type. So, for MagicCon: Philadelphia, Command Zone access will be purchasable as an add-on for any ticket for $30/day or $75 for the entire three-day weekend.</p>

<p>Featured artists were popular at <i>Magic</i> 30, and illustrator guests continue at MagicCon: Philadelphia. We're excited to announce that John Avon will be joining our featured artists lineup! <a href="#Art">We'll share more</a> featured artists for MagicCon: Philadelphia soon.</p>

<p>Finally, we also acknowledge that there were difficulties with both event registration and event start times that led to some poor experiences for fans. These difficulties were largely due to event software integration and not a reflection on how our partner Pastimes managed the tournament space. We are working internally and with ReedPop to find better solutions in these spaces ahead of MagicCon: Philadelphia.</p>

<div id="Schedule"></div>

<p>There will be so much to enjoy at this event. The Cosplay Contest is returning (with updated prizes), the <i>Weatherlight</i> and immersive Planeswalker lairs are making the trip, and there will be new panels, merchandise, and events. Whether you were in Las Vegas or missed our inaugural event, you can enjoy plenty of new and returning experiences at MagicCon: Philadelphia.</p>

<h1>The 2023 MagicCon Schedule</h1>

<p>After Philadelphia, the party doesn't stop! We'll have three more MagicCon events in 2023 at the locations below. Note that for 2024 we're exploring expanding MagicCon outside of North America and Europe!</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>February 17–19, 2023</b>: MagicCon: Philadelphia</li>
	<li><b>May 5–7, 2023</b>: MagicCon: Minneapolis</li>
	<li><b>July 2023</b>: MagicCon in Europe</li>
	<li><b>September 22–24, 2023</b>: MagicCon: Las Vegas and <i>Magic</i> World Championship XXIX</li>
</ul>

<div id="Perspectives"></div>

<p>Each of these events will be shaped after the experience at <i>Magic</i> 30, will include a Pro Tour stop (or the World Championship) and, of course, we'll be making improvements along the way!</p>

<h1>The New Perspectives Grant Program</h1>

<p>The New Perspectives Grant Program is a program that aims to support the inclusion of <i>Magic</i> enthusiasts who belong to historically underrepresented groups by providing assistance to attend MagicCon events. After its first successful outing in Las Vegas, we're expanding the program for all of 2023 to all four MagicCon events!</p>

<p>How successful was it? Just ask the winner of the <i>Magic</i> 30 Cosplay Contest!</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thank you for giving me a chance to be at <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Magic30?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Magic30</a>!

I hope my win reminds Wizards that <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MTG?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MTG</a> thrives when we make it accessible to those who come from historically disadvantaged backgrounds. <a href="https://t.co/607e9MzknW">https://t.co/607e9MzknW</a></p>&mdash; Dark Pact Cфsplay, Nightmare&#39;s Muse (he/they) (@DarkPactCosplay) <a href="https://twitter.com/DarkPactCosplay/status/1586832595358126080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 30, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The program will work the same way for MagicCon: Philadelphia as it did for <i>Magic</i> 30. Ten (10) selected applicants will each receive:</p>

<ul>
	<li>One (1) Black Lotus VIP Package, including a three-day badge to MagicCon: Philadelphia</li>
	<li>$2,000 stipend for travel, accommodations, and expenses related to MagicCon: Philadelphia attendance</li>
</ul>

<p>Application submissions will be accepted November 10, 2022, through 12 a.m. PT November 27, 2022.</p>

<p><b>Update December 5, 2022:</b> We appreciate your interest in the New Perspectives Grant Program, and thanks to all applicants for the care and time invested in each submission. We received a large number of applications and prioritize thorough and careful review of every one. We are extending our recipient notification date to no later than 11:59 p.m. Pacific Time on December 9, 2022. Selected applicants must confirm acceptance of their New Perspectives Grant via email response by 12 a.m. PT on December 16, 2022, or the grant may be given to another applicant.</p>

<p>You can see the artwork for these amazing promo cards below.</p>

<p><i>Secret Lair</i> Showdown Qualifiers at MagicCon: Philadelphia will be Pioneer, with events firing at 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. Friday and Saturday. They lead to the <i>Secret Lair</i> Showdown Championship on Sunday morning, also in the Pioneer format. We'll have more information on prizes and pricing on December 1.</p>

<p><b>Black Lotus VIP Event</b>: On Sunday, February 19 at 11 a.m. all Black Lotus VIP badge holders can play in this <i>free</i> event featuring <i>Dominaria Remastered</i> Sealed! This event will feature special prizes for participants, and it only takes place on Sunday at 11 a.m. for these badge holders.</p>

<p><b>Pro Tour 2 Qualifiers</b>: Eight Pro Tour 2 invitations are on the line over the course of the weekend, taking place across two events: one at 12 p.m. Friday, February 17, and one at 12 p.m. Saturday, February 18. Each event will be Sealed Deck with a Top 8 draft. The Top 4 competitors of each event earn invitations. (Pro Tour 2 will take place at MagicCon: Minneapolis May 5–7, 2023.)</p>

<p><b>The Un-Known!</b>: Join Gavin Verhey and friends as they take you on a journey through Un-Known <i>Magic</i>! This event, and the fun within, will never be the same twice as the products (which are unknown), the formats (also unknown), and the twists and turns (uh, obviously unknown) will be at the whim of your host(s)! Bring nothing with you, because the fun and cards will be provided as you experience the Un-Known! Please be advised that this event may be listed multiple times, but it is never the same game twice! Also, despite the name, <i>Un-</i> product will not necessarily be involved in this event. Also also, keep all limbs safely in the vehicle and expect to have no idea what to expect for 3–4 hours of Un-Known <i>Magic</i>-al adventure.</p>

<p>We'll have <i>some</i> more details on December 1, but the rest will be—you guessed it—unknown!</p>

<p><b>Dedicated On-Demand Events</b>: One of the most common requests we received was for more space for on-demand events—and we heard you! On-demand events will be run all weekend and will have a dedicated area in the Play Hall (Hall F). These events are still subject to space and admin availability, but there will certainly be more room available than at <i>Magic</i> 30.</p>

<p><b>The Command Zone</b>: The Command Zone space is popular—so popular we've added the add-on Command Zone benefit for $30 per day or $75 for the whole weekend, available for any ticket package.</p>

<p>And much, much more! Visit mtgfestivals.com and <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayMTG" target="_blank">@PlayMTG</a> on December 1 for a full rundown of all play opportunities!</p>

<h2>Cosplayers and the Cosplay Contest</h2>

<p>We'll continue to have our immersive experiences at MagicCon: Philadelphia, featuring cosplayers in attendance for photographs and fun. The lineup of amazing cosplayers will be available closer to the event.</p>

<div id="Art"></div>

<p>Applications for panels at MagicCon: Philadelphia will open November 17.</p>

<h2>The Art of <i>Magic</i></h2>

<p>Our artist booth area was incredibly popular at <i>Magic</i> 30, and we're looking to improve on that experience at MagicCon: Philadelphia! In addition to John Avon, artists including Dominik Mayer, Justine Jones, Wizard of Barge, and Chris Rallis will be at MagicCon: Philadelphia. We'll share even more artist guests soon.</p>

<p>That's perhaps a misnomer these days, as it's not just Pro Tours – starting with the Pro Tour at <a href="https://magic30.mtgfestivals.com/en-us.html" target="_blank">MagicCon: Philadelphia</a> in just a few months – that draw up to a dozen competitors to share a rental for up to two weeks before a tournament with the sole intention of playing so much <i>Magic</i> that the result will be a material edge once play begins.</p>

<p>The history of high-level play owes a lot to these groups. Perhaps you can trace the origin of this all the way back to those early late '90s testing teams that were tearing up the scene at the time. But one is for certain: over the past decade of high-level <i>Magic,</i> these testing houses were the norm and result was teams emerging more prepared than anyone else in the room (or the world) for the Draft or Constructed format of choice.</p>

<p>Along the way, much <i>Magic</i> is played, and more made. The best stories to come from this tradition rarely had to do with exactly which card was higher in a draft order (though plenty of that was pretty important along the way, too).</p>

<embed-iframe fallback-img="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/1TzbKdTr0eC7lEIZh8S2hP/21f407e22dca180089c98aa97de01080/1920x1080_Blue_Background_Full.png" has-consent="true"   width="920" height="518" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z59M9DheHZ0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></embed-iframe>

<p>With the return of the testing house for recent in-person events (Andrea Mengucci and Javier Dominguez organized a lively one for the <a href="https://magic.gg/news/the-week-that-was-the-gathering-of-winners" target="_blank">Regional Championship in Bulgaria</a> last weekend), it's been a fun throwback as a new generation of Pro Tour players navigate their path and veterans return to the PT. Across the world, teams of <i>Magic</i> players are coming together to do what they dreamed of since their first Friday Night <i>Magic</i>: break the format.</p>

<p>So with the global string of Regional Championships in full swing, I've been thinking about the success of these testing teams – and today I want to focus on the "team" part of that. It might be easy to assume that when we say "teams of up to a dozen players" that it means 12 players who will be competing in the Pro Tour or World Championship in question. But that's not always the case; being a good teammate often means contributing without competing. It's not unheard of for some teams to have designated, non-qualified members dedicated to things like format tracking, draft orders or even cooking for the house – format-breaking is hungry work.</p>

<p>This is even more magnified when it comes to the highest level of competition; namely, the <a href="https://magic.gg/world-championship" target="_blank">World Championship</a>. The event has always been more exclusive than even the Pro Tour and while the size of the field itself has fluctuated over the years, the small-field nature of things has meant that players work in smaller groups. Finding help from those outside the tournament can be hard to come by. All in all, it's a little more complicated than you might expect for even the best players in the world to prepare for a World Championship tournament that often tests skills across multiple formats.</p>

<p>That's where Anthony Lee comes in.</p>

<p>A Pro Tour competitor in his own right, Lee was battling for his breakthrough to the next level. Working with some of the best teams from across the world, the Australian native had experienced his share of success – two Grand Prix Top 8s speak to that – but he never found success rising to the level of the World Championship.</p>

<p>His friends and teammates did, though. So Lee did what good teammates do: he threw in for the cause, with his time, expertise and strengths as a format analyst. He watched along with the rest of the world as his teammates played under the brightest lights, anxious for the chance to earn his own way there one day. He was such a dedicated part of the team that in the one case he couldn't make it, his team made sure he was there anyway – a life-size cardboard cutout of Lee graced the halls that weekend.</p>

<p>Well, after the Regional Championship for Australia/New Zealand last weekend, Lee won't be watching from the sidelines any longer, in cardboard form or no – he'll be competing at the World Championship in 2023 following his <a href="https://magic.gg/news/anthony-lee-wins-anz-super-series-finals-in-sidney" target="_blank">Regional Championship victory</a>.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Congratulations to the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ANZSuperSeries?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ANZSuperSeries</a> champion, Anthony Lee, who locks up a World Championship slot with this win! <a href="https://t.co/krKAFxGnjx">pic.twitter.com/krKAFxGnjx</a></p>&mdash; PlayMTG (@PlayMTG) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayMTG/status/1596744473374957568?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 27, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>"It's amazing to realize that I will get to play in a World Championship after helping competitors for the last five of them," Lee explained. "People were incredible supportive throughout the event, both on this side of the world and the rest as well, and I genuinely believe that meaningfully helped. Those are the people who make it worth coming all the way from Perth."</p>

<p>The format story from week one of the Regional Championship loop was that Mono-Green Devotion wasn't the boogeyman some had feared in Pioneer. The deck underperformed in the first set of events <a href="https://magic.gg/news/metagame-mentor-the-quadruple-regional-championship-weekend" target="_blank">(see Frank's column for more)</a> and the ANZ <i>Magic</i> Super Series Top 8 was more of the same – both of the deck's pilots were knocked out in the quarterfinals and the finals was a Rakdos Midrange mirror between Lee and former Grand Prix winner David Mines, whom Lee dispatched in two games to earn the title and invites to the first Pro Tour next year along with the 2023 World Championship.</p>

<p>"I was reasonably confident going into this event because of course being part of such a strong European testing team is undeniably a compelling advantage, but qualifying was far from a safe bet between both natural variance and that many Australian competitors have been reinvigorated by the return of competitive organized play that suits our region very well," Lee explained. "I was happy with how I played the games throughout the event and could feel how our preparation was getting me wins I wouldn't otherwise have gotten, which is one of the best things you can feel in an event. I had several very intense matches, whether because they involved sweating some critical draw steps or being very technically demanding, so the whole day was full of excitement."</p>

<p>A day of excitement, to put it lightly. Lee's friends and teammates who have been the beneficiaries of his generosity were ecstatic to watch him finally earn the landmark victory he's been working toward for years.</p>

<p>"Anthony's understanding of the game is very deep, and he's extremely good at figuring out how decks work and why," Dominguez gushed. "Anthony has been really helpful and supportive through all of my big <i>Magic</i> scores, and he has also been helping other friends out as well. I'm really excited for him, it is finally his time to play Worlds, and hopefully he takes it home!"</p>

<p>With his win, Lee has set himself up for a big 2023 with the World Championship tournament waiting for him at the end. But he's not making any concrete plans quite yet.</p>

<p>"I don't like to set specific goals and I very much believe in focusing on adapting as we see things unfold. So I'll try to keep doing what I've been doing for the last few years – making sure I contribute as much as I can to whatever testing groups I'm a part of, and whatever it brings me or my colleagues will be a gift," he explained. "So, basically, I have no idea what's next and I prefer it that way!"</p>

<p>While Lee may not want to know exactly what's coming next, the path to the Pro Tour and the World Championship rolls ever on. A handful of players added their names to the World Championship invite list last weekend, while dozens more qualified for the first Pro Tour of the year – and for many of them the first Pro Tour of their careers.</p>

<p>The Regional Championship in Japan/Korea was won by Rei Hirayama, who defeated Masamasa Kyogoku in another Rakdos mirror finals after a brilliant Top 8 that included Hall of Famers Shota Yasooka and Shuhei Nakamura. And it was Azorius Control that took Michael Martin Go to victory at the <a href="https://magic.gg/news/michael-martin-go-triumphs-at-mtg-sea-championships" target="_blank">Regional Championship for Southeast Asia</a>, adding another wrinkle to the settling Pioneer metagame. But In <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Tournament/View/11821" target="_blank">Canada</a>, Christian Trudel showed that Nykthos is still a force, <a href="https://magic.gg/news/christian-trudel-wins-big-at-torontos-f2f-tour" target="_blank">winning the tournament</a> with the big-mana brew.</p>

<p>Coming on the heels of big events in the United States, Europe and Brazil two weeks ago, the Regional Championships are sorting out Pioneer while feeding the first Pro Tour and setting up the stories that we'll watch unfold all the way through the World Championship.</p>

<p>Hirayama was well-aware of the future available to him that had been made possible by the many greats who have come before him from Japan, and he took the time to honor one of this after his victory: the late <a href="https://magic.gg/news/the-week-that-was-the-gathering-of-winners" target="_blank">Kazuyuki Takimura</a>, who was also recognized with a <a href="https://mtg-jp.com/coverage/cc22f1/article/0036532/" target="_blank">special memorial at the event</a>.</p>

<p>"The person I want to convey this victory to the most is Mr. Takimura," <a href="https://mtg-jp.com/coverage/cc22f1/article/0036534/" target="_blank">Hirayama said in part</a> after his victory.</p>

When the dust settled on the competition at the ANZ Super Series, it was the seasoned Pro Tour veteran Anthony Lee who rose above all other competitors with his Rakdos Midrange deck!

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/7aCV84ScvovU8h55uAe4Be/8e3e0c274b7e81a62dce390ac5b6b10e/Anthony-Lee-Trophy-3.jpg" /><p class="embedImageCaption">Congratulations to Anthony Lee!</p></div></div><br />

Rakdos was a very popular deck in Sydney this weekend, also propelling David Mines - who has led Australia to two WMC Top 8s in the past - into the final, where he ultimately fell to Lee. While both secured their spot at the Pro Tour with a top 12 finish, Lee also earned an invitation to the World Championship with his victory.

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/5mEyXOVWf0sggZgPpEFXbk/b1f88937339a8023f047dd525c503c30/anz-finals-anthony.jpg" /><p class="embedImageCaption">Anthony Lee during the finals</p></div></div><br />

Lee will be a familiar face to many, as a member of world-class testing teams alongside the likes of Javier Dominguez and Marcio Carvalho. There are few players as experienced and well-equipped to represent Australia on Magic’s biggest stage at the World Championship!

Rakdos was the deck of the weekend, with four different players on the midrange deck in the Top 8. Mono-Green also put two players into the Top 8, with Mono-Blue Spirits and Lotus Field Combo rounding out the rest of the top decks. 

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/6oY2e1lUy60zpkMNcIkgRx/432df9052da9ea31570341e9a403bad4/anz-top-8.jpg" /><p class="embedImageCaption">Nick Malcolm Preston, David Mines, Steven Hitchcock, Daniel Riley, Dan Bretherton, Chris Miller, Anthony Lee, Brennan Crawford</p></div></div><br />

The top 12 players from the ANZ Super Series will be representing the Australia-New Zealand region at the first Pro Tour next year, taking place at MagicCon: Philadelphia in February. We can’t wait to see them all in Philly! 

Pioneer continued to evolve this weekend, as players adapted to the results from the big Regional Championships in North America, Europe, and Brazil the weekend before. Rakdos and Mono-Green were quite comfortably the most popular decks, with Izzet Phoenix and Abzan Greasefang not managing to break through the Swiss and into the Top 8. 

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/3m5EaWEF10IhaDF091K6q1/e23867b23ee1c443283ded2519148302/ANZSS_Metagame_Finished.png" /></div></div><br />

More than anything else, however, it was the energy in Sydney that made the tournament so special.

The format was Pioneer, and what a show the format put on - Rakdos and Mono-Green failed to deliver, and so we saw some very spicy decks succeed. 

In the end, however, it was Michael Martin Go with Azorius Control who won the day, dispatching Heng Chye Hwee’s Mono-White Humans in the final to lock up a World Championship invitation!

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/2q56AF2ZPSZfZw4RmUWDOD/e6be4edcaf2aadee4e5df8d0e8623d6b/sea-champ-photo.jpg" /><p class="embedImageCaption">Congratulations to Michael Martin Go!</p></div></div><br />

The Top 8 was filled with unexpected decks, and two of them met in the championship match. The aggression of Mono-White Aggro managed to win Heng Chye Hwee one game, at least, but the power of Azorius Control’s sweepers and removal was too much for Heng, and saw Go win 2-1.

All the players in the Top 8 received invitations to the upcoming Pro Tour, taking place at MagicCon: Philadelphia in February. Let’s hope they bring equally spicy decks for us in Philly!

As mentioned, the decks in the Top 8 were pretty wild. Only one copy of Rakdos Midrange made it in, despite Rakdos’ strong performances in other Regional Championships: instead, in addition to Azorius and Mono-White, there was Selesnya Auras, Selesnya Angels, and two different Fires of Invention decks!

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/4GGkiC3hoH77u5DOJ6W14B/9e644287889d86fae76cc237c34ceacf/sea-metagame.jpg" /></div></div><br />

Players also enjoyed a range of other events at the SEA Championships, as Magic fans around the world begin to gather once again and celebrate the game we all love. Players from around Southeast Asia got involved with Commander, drafts, and even Legacy in the side events, as well as a $5,000 Modern event on Sunday. It’s great to have competitive Magic back in full swing!

Tables filled with deckboxes and notepads. The hum of hundreds of players shuffling cards at the same time. The quiet that fills the room when a round begins, palpable to spectators gathered around the top tables—and pierced by the head judge chiming in.</p>

<p>Across, next to, behind, around... <a href="https://dreamhack.com/atlanta/magic/" target="_blank">DreamHack Atlanta</a>. Thousands of enthusiasts and competitors converging from across the continent to share in a passion for gaming, with thousands more watching along. Every step around the venue was an opportunity to stumble across a new game, a new cosplay, a new fandom or community—each as engaging as our own. That was DreamHack Atlanta, and it was there that the first <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Tournament/View/12649" target="_blank">US Regional Championship</a> was taking the stage while their counterparts in Europe and Brazil did the same, all in pursuit of Pro Tour and <a href="https://magic.gg/world-championship" target="_blank"><i>Magic</i> World Championship</a> invitations. It was an in-person <i>Magic</i> tournament, and that meant a lot to the players and people who worked hard to get back to here: high-stakes tabletop <i>Magic</i> with all the pressure and accolades that come.</p>

<p>Matthew Saypoff was right at home.</p>

<p>"I first started playing competitive tournaments 20 years ago, when my parents would drive me around to play in the Junior Super Series tournaments," he explained. "So when the news of the paper Pro Tour coming back came out, I had the competitive desire again."</p>

<p>With the fire came the battle, and a perfect demonstration of one of the strengths of competitive play: a local Brooklyn veteran went from a small Regional Championship Qualifier to the large-scale Regional Championship. And then he took the Pioneer field by storm with one of his favorite decks: <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/256856" target="_blank">Mono-White Humans</a>. He snuck into the Top 8 and then upset a Pro Tour winner in Eli Loveman in the quarterfinals. He kept up the momentum with a semifinals win, and then it all came together with a finals victory over Ken Takahama.</p>

<p>And like that, Saypoff went from local RCQs to qualifying for the World Championship, where he'll compete in 2023 thanks to his ascendant Regional Championship victory.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A huge congratulations to the Dreamhack Showdown Regional Champion, Matthew Saypoff with Mono-White Humans!<br><br>And Congrats to our finalist, Ken Takahama.

<p>"It's all so surreal," Saypoff explained. "My goal had been to make it to this event and then try and finish in the Top 48 to qualify for the paper Pro Tour; the rest would all be gravy. Before this I had a handful of PTQ Top 8s and Grand Prix cashes—it was enough to know I was good enough to do okay, but doing something like this is so completely unexpected. ... I'm ecstatic about the entire situation."</p>

<p>As my column-mate Frank Karsten reported from his Regional Championship experience in Sofia, Bulgaria, Regional Championship genuinely felt like the return of the "<a href="https://magic.gg/pro-tour" target="_blank">Pro Tour experience</a>." The fields in Atlanta and Sofia featured almost all of the best players rising to the top tables, we had World Champions organizing old-school testing houses, we had Hall of Famers hanging on round-by-round results on social media. With video coverage and big stakes and satellite events running hot–with the promise of the Pro Tour percolating through it all–it was clear "the gathering" was back, boosters and all.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Took this picture at the hotel with my prize winnings from today. Is it good enough for Twitter? <a href="https://t.co/ighr8CZaGl">pic.twitter.com/ighr8CZaGl</a></p>&mdash; Andrea Mengucci (@Mengu09) <a href="https://twitter.com/Mengu09/status/1594393239754113024?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 20, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>In the United States, Saypoff's Mono-White Humans deck took the diverse field by surprise—eight different decks in the Top 8—on his way to victory. Meanwhile, Pedro Mocelin stayed to the well-known path in Brazil's Regional Championship, defeating Jorgemi Sant'Anna in a Rakdos Midrange mirror in the City Class Games Showdown final to <a href="https://magic.gg/news/brazils-pedro-mocelin-wins-regional-title-at-city-class-showdown" target="_blank">win the title</a>.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/5YgoBYnC1C1ims0HcXmyx7/8c791a69b9cfc6b08d5cc8286b3a5a2d/ccs-pedro-mocelin-champion.png" /><p class="embedImageCaption">Pedro Mocelin</p></div></div><br />

<p>Mocelin's victory is a key part of the first weekend of Regional Championships, as it blasts another hole in the narrative that Mono-Green Devotion is the only deck in Pioneer worth playing at a high-level event. The deck's explosive <auto-card>Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx</auto-card>-fueled starts give it one of the highest ceilings in the format, and its proactive gameplan made it an easy choice for many of the 1,500 competitors. But in fact, despite leading the field at 20% Mono-Green managed a sub-50% winrate over three Regional Championships (Thanks for the insight, Frank!). Rakdos was the second-most popular archetype, and it boasted a better rate than the feared Devotion deck.</p>

<p>"I chose Rakdos because I like to stand a chance in all matches, and this deck gives you that," Mocelin explained. "<auto-card>Thoughtseize</auto-card> was my best card in the tournament; I like to have all the information I can to make the right plays."</p>

<p>Across the Atlantic, it was Madrid native Miguel Castro who took down the Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) Regional Championship, piloting Izzet Phoenix through a Top 8 that featured a handful of new faces on familiar archetypes (plus a sighting of the 2017 Italian national champion Adriano Moscato).</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/8W1Zeq4cdyFxkboXG7uoI/f71b7b6ad1e5b94dd6bce26078a18bd6/euro-champ-cycle-1-2022.png" /><p class="embedImageCaption">Miguel Castro</p></div></div><br />

<p>Castro was one of three Phoenix players in the Top 8 in Europe, the same deck that made the finals in America in Takahama's hands (one copy made the Top 8 of a diverse field in Brazil). Castro was one of the players who made a full experience of the EMEA Regional Championship, spending a week at a testing house with friends in advance of the tournament. Their conclusion was that in an open field like Pioneer where few decks held distinct advantages—a belief shared by most competitors I spoke to—was that playing a deck they were comfortable with trumped most other concerns, and Izzet Phoenix has long been the go-to deck in those kinds of circumstances.</p>

<p>And for good reason: it carried three players to the Top 8 and Castro to the title.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark"><p lang="es" dir="ltr">Ya en casa tras un fin de semana increíble, aún tratando de asimilar todas las emociones y acontecimientos vividos.

<p>All of this sets the stage perfectly for the next month of Regional Championships as the rest of the <i>Magic</i>-playing world completes their own events and awards their World Championship invitations. These events bring the best in the world together and will build the field as we go for the first paper Pro Tour of 2023, coming at <a href="https://mcphiladelphia.mtgfestivals.com/" target="_blank">MagicCon Philadelphia</a>. Much <a href="https://magic.gg/news/the-week-that-was-the-greatest-steuer-ever-told" target="_blank">like Nathan Steuer's victory</a> at <a href="https://magic.gg/events/magic-world-championship-xxviii" target="_blank"><i>Magic</i> World Championship XXVIII</a>, we are witnessing the future of <i>Magic</i> that has been stewing in a world of online tournaments arrive in person and announce their arrival.</p>

<p>Speaking of <i>Magic</i> World Championship XXIX coming in 2023, five players in all punched their ticket to join Steuer there. The finalists in the United States and EMEA along with the winning player in Brazil add their names to the list:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Matthew Saypoff</li>
	<li>Ken Takahama</li>
	<li>Miguel Castro</li>
	<li>Théau Méry</li>
	<li>Pedro Mocelin</li>
</ul>

<p>The World Championship invite list will continue to fill in the weeks ahead, as <i>Magic</i> dreams are made and the gathering continues. As for Saypoff, the Regional Championship victory is a long way—hundreds of miles and a couple of decades—from the 12-year-old who pestered his parents for rides to Friday Night <i>Magic</i>. At the same time, it's not all that far: he's still dreaming of the Pro Tour.</p>

<p>"I first discovered <i>Magic</i> when I went into my local hobby store to look at a Gundam model, and the players there taught me to play. I was immediately hooked as a 10-year-old," he recalled. "As a kid, I loved looking at all the different art. I got insanely into it and I was very fortunate to have a family that was supportive.</p>

<p>"That turned into playing as much as I could, and eventually I qualified for one of the online events. I felt like I could check it off my list, but then I learned I could make it onto the paper Pro Tour. So I worked really hard with my friend Dan Sondike, a well-known <i>Magic Online</i> player who was able to get us hooked up to other players on Discord. We did a lot theorcrafting about the format, and played in a <i>lot</i> of leagues. I'm really excited for next year, and I'm going to take it really seriously because the World Championship is an opportunity you can't pass up. But for the next few weeks at least, I'm looking forward to relaxing over the holidays and relaxing with some Cube!"</p>

<h1>Looking Ahead</h1>

<p>The schedule for the remaining Regional Championships in this first round is as follows (including those from over the weekend):</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>November 26-27</b>: <a href="https://ssl.bigmagic.net/championscup/factsheet-final" target="_blank">Japan/Korea</a>, <a href="https://www.anzmtg.com.au/super-series-finals/" target="_blank">Australia/New Zealand</a>, <a href="https://f2ftour.com/event/f2f-tour-weekend-toronto-2022/" target="_blank">East Canada</a>, <a href="https://www.mtgseachampionships.com/upcoming-events" target="_blank">Southeast Asia</a></li>
	<li><b>December 3-4</b>: <a href="https://gamesquare.tw/mit-register-3-1.php?cid=3" target="_blank">Chinese Taipei</a>, <a href="https://southamericamagicseries.com/regional-championship/" target="_blank">South America</a>, <a href="http://www.kadouevents.cn/" target="_blank">China </a></li>
	<li><b>December 10-11</b>: <a href="https://f2ftour.com/event/f2f-tour-weekend-calgary-2022/" target="_blank">West Canada</a></li>
	<li><b>December 17-18</b>: <a href="https://thegatheringseries.com/en/prizes/" target="_blank">Mexico/Central America/Caribbean</a></li>
</ul>

<p>It's not a stretch to say that these events will tell the story of 2023, even if we don't know what it is yet. But <i>Magic</i> history is filled with opportunities seized by upcoming players who make the Top 8 of a seemingly one-off event, only to announce themselves as a mainstay soon after. Is the next Chris Kvartek or Nathan Steuer or Yudai Miyano lurking among these tournaments fields? Almost certainly. And that what makes them so fun to watch play out—not to mention the impact this slate of events will have on Pioneer. (I'll leave that part to Frank to break down.)</p>

<p>The gathering is back, and the path to the Pro Tour marches on.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Metagame Mentor: Pioneer at the EMEA, US, and Brazilian Regional Championships</title><link>https://magic.gg/news/metagame-mentor-pioneer-at-the-emea-us-and-brazilian-regional-championships</link><guid>https://magic.gg/news/metagame-mentor-pioneer-at-the-emea-us-and-brazilian-regional-championships</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>Last weekend featured the debut of the Regional Championships, the thrice-yearly step on the path to the Pro Tour. In Europe, U.S.A., and Brazil, over 1500 total players arrived with their best Pioneer decks to compete for a combined 92 Pro Tour slots, 5 World Championship invitations, and $255,000 in prizes. And this was only the start of this Regional Championship season, as eight other geographic regions will follow in the weeks to come.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/DJPNxAlrmrCNwY5ZB7Fc6/a1e2363f540575f16e5741b149b2280d/1080x1080-Magic-Premier-Play-Path-2022-2023-Infographic.jpg" /></div></div><br />

<p>I competed in Sofia, Bulgaria myself, and it genuinely felt like high-level paper <i>Magic</i> again, with all the big names playing at the top tables and the excitement of win-and-ins for Pro Tours. This sentiment was echoed by many players I talked to, some of whom gathered in testing houses a week before the event. The tournament was well-ran, we had video coverage all weekend, and there were big prizes on the line. Even though I didn't win a lot of matches, I had a great time.</p>

<p>In this article, I will analyze all of last weekend's Regional Championships in a combined way. The article is structed as follows: First, I will celebrate the champions, who received well-earned trophies. Second, I will provide the combined metagame breakdown and the match win rates for all major archetypes. Third, I will showcase the most-played cards from <i>The Brothers' War</i>, as this was the first weekend in which the new set was legal. Fourth, I will go over the top deck archetypes in Pioneer right now. Fifth, I will highlight the spiciest decklists that earned a Pro Tour qualification. Sixth, I will look ahead to next weekend's Regional Championships. Let's get started.</p>

<h1>The Metagame and Win Rates</h1>

<p>Based on the decklists from all three Regional Championships, unweighted, I determined the combined metagame share of every archetype. I also calculated their non-mirror, non-bye match win rates. I used my own algorithms and definitions to assign archetype labels, thereby sidestepping any potential mislabeling on MTG Melee. Let's take a look!</p>

<p>The metagame across the three Regional Championships was largely many players expected. The most-popular archetype was Mono-Green Devotion, but it had a clear target on its head and scored a below-average win rate as a result. Players were ready for it, and no deck in Pioneer is unbeatable.</p>

<p>Lotus Field combo and Izzet Phoenix had an excellent performance; they were superb choices for the weekend, and I would expect to see them rise in popularity in the coming weeks. By contrast, Keruga Fires did poorly, largely as a result of a bad matchup against Mono-Green Devotion.</p>

<p>To me, the format looks diverse and balanced. The Top 8 of the U.S. Regional Championship had eight different deck archetypes, every color is represented, and the winrates of the most-played archetypes are close to 50-50. When this is the case, skill and expertise at piloting your deck and knowledge of your matchups and interactions is often the crucial factor.</p>

<p>As U.S. Regional Champion Matthew Saypoff said in his winner interview: "Any deck can do well in Pioneer … So it's really a matter of picking a deck you like the play pattern of and can get really good at."</p>

<h1>The Most-Played Cards from <i>The Brothers' War</i></h1>

<p>In last weekend's Regional Championships, the most-played cards overall, summing copies in both main decks and sideboards other than basic lands, were <auto-card>Llanowar Elves</auto-card>, <auto-card>Elvish Mystic</auto-card>, <auto-card>Fable of the Mirror-Breaker</auto-card>, <auto-card>Bonecrusher Giant</auto-card>, <auto-card>Thoughtseize</auto-card>, and <auto-card>Fatal Push</auto-card>. These are the real format staples of Pioneer that fit into multiple archetypes, but that shouldn't come as a surprise.</p>

<p>What's more interesting is the impact of <i>The Brothers' War</i> on Pioneer, as this was the first weekend where the new set was legal. The following table has the 25 most-played new-to-Pioneer cards in decklists submitted to last weekend's Regional Championships.</p>

<p>To show where some of these new cards found home, let's go over the top-tier decks in the metagame right now.</p>

<h1>The 8 Decks to Beat in Pioneer</h1>

<p>The eight decks I will highlight in this section include the four most popular archetypes—Mono-Green Devotion, Rakdos Midrange, Izzet Phoenix, and Mono-White Humans, all of which gained new cards from <i>The Brothers' War</i>—plus four promising archetypes that had a great performance last weekend. If you're unfamiliar with Pioneer, then I recommend reading <a href="https://www.magic.gg/news/metagame-mentor-pioneer-before-the-regional-championships" target="_blank">my format primer from last week</a> first.</p>

<p>All of the decklists I will show were played by players who placed highly enough to earn a Pro Tour invitation, so we'll see all of them at the Pro Tour held during <a href="https://magic30.mtgfestivals.com/en-us/home.html" target="_blank">MagicCon: Philadelphia</a> on February 17-19, 2023. In selecting specific decklists to highlight, I favored the ones with innovations from <i>The Brothers' War</i>.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/7Dcvi42lfHCFffte8Eqcrr/d97d9fbec747132af7b41f153bef741b/Mono-Green_Devotion.jpg" /></div></div><br />

<p>Mono-Green Devotion was the most popular deck archetype at 20.7% of the field, but it merely had a 48.6% non-mirror match win rate. According to the data, it was great against Rakdos Sacrifice and Keruga Fires but weak to Selesnya Auras, Boros Heroic, and Mono-Blue Spirits.</p>

<p>The deck did gain a lot of new cards from <i>The Brothers' War</i> to bolster <auto-card>Karn, the Great Creator</auto-card>, most notably <auto-card>The Stone Brain</auto-card>, <auto-card>Cityscape Leveler</auto-card>, and <auto-card>Haywire Mite</auto-card>. Many players included <auto-card>The Mightstone and Weakstone</auto-card> and <auto-card>Woodcaller Automaton</auto-card> as well.</p>

<p>Brent Vos, who finished 9th at the European Championship, went even further by running three total copies of <auto-card>Woodcaller Automaton</auto-card>: Two in the main deck and one in the sideboard. The main deck copies replaced flex slots customarily taken by <auto-card>Sylvan Caryatid</auto-card>, <auto-card>Lovestruck Beast</auto-card>, and/or <auto-card>Nicol Bolas, Dragon-God</auto-card>. The reason why <auto-card>Woodcaller Automaton</auto-card> fits so well is that it adds two devotion to green while untapping <auto-card>Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx</auto-card>. This makes it easier to generate absurd amounts of mana and combo off.</p>

<p>His list also goes against the mold by running 22 lands, which I believe to be the correct number. Little tweaks can go a long way.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/6ZrzXC3RwCHUdju7GRLd0I/a20f1c675abee862f6a69ed20fcdeeaa/Rakdos_Midrange.jpg" /></div></div><br />

<p>Rakdos Midrange was solid all around, with a 14.0% metagame share and a 50.4% match win rate. It was soft to Enigmatic Fires and Gruul Vehicles, but it performed well against Bant Spirits and Abzan Greasefang.</p>

<p>The most-played card overall from <i>The Brothers' War</i> was <auto-card>Misery's Shadow</auto-card>. Eli Loveman, who finished in the Top 8 of the U.S. Regional Championship, ran three copies in his Rakdos Midrange deck. Like <auto-card>Kalitas, Traitor of Ghet</auto-card>, it prevents the death triggers on <auto-card>Old-Growth Troll</auto-card> and <auto-card>Cavalier of Thorns</auto-card>, and it's a solid mana sink in the late game. Yet <auto-card>Misery's Shadow</auto-card> adds more pressure in the early game, which matters a lot in matchups where you have to be the aggressor.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/4LguGoZO5Yf117GS7RommI/58e5bdb53d08b760dc2804b39fcee7fe/Izzet_Phoenix.jpg" /></div></div><br />

<p>Izzet Phoenix had an excellent weekend, with a 11.3% metagame share and a 53.3% match win rate. (To give an indication of significance based on the sample size: the 95% Clopper-Pearson confidence interval for Izzet Phoenix's win rate ranged from 50.5% to 56.2%.) In terms of matchups, Izzet Phoenix was particularly strong against Mono-Blue Spirits, Bant Spirits, and all decks lumped in the "Other" category, yet it had a terrible time against Lotus Field combo.</p>

<p>A popular sideboard inclusion from the new set was <auto-card>Brotherhood's End</auto-card>. Miguel Castro, who won the European Championship, had two copies in his sideboard. It not only sweeps creatures and planeswalkers but also gives an out to <auto-card>Unlicensed Hearse</auto-card>. But this tweak was only a small part of his success—Miguel Castro had played <auto-card>Arclight Phoenix</auto-card> in Standard and Modern in the past, and he leaned on his extensive multi-format experience with the card to navigate the matches and claim the trophy.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/19Ht2C5nZB70TPSY37SNCb/e4d3d7c2f6bae710655ab001763872bb/Mono-White_Humans.jpg" /></div></div><br />

<p>Mono-White Humans was 6.2% of the field and posted a solid 51.9% match win rate. According to the data, it had a favorable matchup against Mono-Green Devotion, but it did terribly against Selesnya Angels, Rakdos Sacrifice, and Gruul Vehicles.</p>

<p><i>The Brothers' War</i> introduced <auto-card>Recruitment Officer</auto-card>, which has replaced <auto-card>Soldier of the Pantheon</auto-card> in most lists. Matthew Saypoff, who won the U.S. Regional Championship, had the full four copies in his main deck. The abilities on <auto-card>Soldier of the Pantheon</auto-card> rarely mattered, whereas <auto-card>Recruitment Officer</auto-card> offers a good mana sink to ensure you won't run out of steam in the late game. You're about 96% to hit at least one creature in your top 4 cards.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/D08TEt3ziiGl4IrmE31dR/401606755227ac8c6c050fcb2f3c6b7a/Gruul_Vehicles.jpg" /></div></div><br />

<p>Gruul Vehicles was 4.4% of the field and posted a solid 52.0% match win rate. According to the data, it performed particularly well against Rakdos Midrange and Mono-White Humans.</p>

<p><i>The Brothers' War</i> introduced <auto-card>Obliterating Bolt</auto-card> as an upgrade over <auto-card>Lava Coil</auto-card>. Lino Torretta, who finished 23rd at the European Championship, had the full four copies in his main deck. The ability to damage planeswalkers can make quite the difference against Mono-Green Devotion, although exiling <auto-card>Old-Growth Troll</auto-card> is still the main purpose of the card.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/33ZeXXFgMIMDsOwOg1D5Tm/5d93056858985fe60c78c420a06dc68f/Selesnya_Angels.jpg" /></div></div><br />

<p>Selesnya Angels was 2.4% of the field and posted an impressive 54.0% match win rate. According to the data, it crushed Mono-White Humans decisively.</p>

<p><i>The Brothers' War</i> introduced <auto-card>Brushland</auto-card> as a mana base upgrade over <auto-card>Sunpetal Grove</auto-card> and <auto-card>Kayla's Reconstruction</auto-card> as an additional <auto-card>Collected Company</auto-card> effect. In the list of Socrates Rozakeas, who finished 31st at the European Championship, <auto-card>Collected Company</auto-card> puts 1.86 creatures with total mana value 4.8 on the battlefield in expectation, and <auto-card>Kayla's Reconstruction</auto-card> for X=2 provides 1.92 creatures with total mana value 5.1 in expectation. So it's card advantage and mana advantage all in one.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/1xAm1gEVlEoscA14n8Shbm/816b82741944c2fd7ae43a6a8ff7fdca/Lotus-Field-combo-proper.jpg" /></div></div><br />

<p>Lotus Field combo was 1.8% of the field and posted an enormous 57.2% match win rate, which is the highest out all major archetypes. So it can be called the breakout deck of the weekend, and that's largely due to its amazing matchup against Izzet Phoenix.</p>

<p>The list of John Tatian, who finished in the Top 4 at the U.S. Regional Championship, did not contain any new cards from <i>The Brothers' War</i>, but he made sure he had <auto-card>Fae of Wishes</auto-card> to diversify his win conditions against opposing <auto-card>The Stone Brain</auto-card>.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/1mf9e7QxavHqrrLbzxNZa8/b6b3013fc4eeb3f5f2e12e9b9d56f5de/Selesnya_Auras_proper.png" /></div></div><br />

<p>Selesnya Auras was merely 0.5% of the field, which may seem low until you realize that it basically didn't exist in the competitive landscape before <i>The Brothers' War</i>. Yet it posted a very promising 54.7% match win rate. According to the data, it decisively crushed Mono-Green Devotion in particular.</p>

<p>This is all largely due to the addition of <auto-card>Brushland</auto-card>. In a deck that wants to cast <auto-card>Gladecover Scout</auto-card> on turn one followed by <auto-card>Ethereal Armor</auto-card> and <auto-card>Sentinel's Eyes</auto-card> on turn two, you need every untapped dual land you can get. <auto-card>Brushland</auto-card> is a massive consistency boost.</p>

<p>In addition, <auto-card>Audacity</auto-card> is reminiscent of <auto-card>Rancor</auto-card> and is perfect for a deck that wants to boost its creatures with Auras while drawing cards with <auto-card>Sram, Senior Edificer</auto-card> and fetching one-ofs with <auto-card>Light-Paws, Emperor's Voice</auto-card>. Michael Letsch crafted a superb list and made the Top 4 at the U.S. Regional Championship.</p>

<h1>Spice Corner</h1>

<p>It's always exciting to see brewers do well with their own creations, and the top tables of the Regional Championships featured plenty of decks that no one or almost no one had on their radar. To support this, I'll highlight the three spiciest decks from the Regional Championships to earn a Pro Tour qualification. I am already looking forward to seeing what these players might bring to the Pro Tour in February, as the depth of Pioneer remains underexplored.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/66eXHYe89Sbw9fD4SznPxP/0bc8a564278d54c91c3c5b60cc155d0d/Storm_Herald_combo.jpg" /></div></div><br />

<p>Pro Tour <i>Amonkhet</i> Top 8 competitor Marc Tobiasch always brews the spiciest decks, and he didn't disappoint at the European Championship. He finished 21st with a deck that no one saw coming.</p>

<p>The game plan of this deck is to put <auto-card>Colossification</auto-card> and <auto-card>Burning Anger</auto-card> into the graveyard and to return them to the battlefield with <auto-card>Storm Herald</auto-card>. This allows you to immediately ping your opponent for upwards of 20 damage. The deck has numerous self-mill cards and discard enablers to put the Auras into the graveyard, while <auto-card>Gather the Pack</auto-card> and <auto-card>Traverse the Ulvenwald</auto-card> can find <auto-card>Storm Herald</auto-card>.</p>

<p>At first glance, this combo might seem inferior to <auto-card>Greasefang, Okiba Boss</auto-card> plus <auto-card>Parhelion II</auto-card>, which needs only one card in the graveyard rather than two. Why go through extra steps? The answer is that <auto-card>Storm Herald</auto-card> combo plays much better against removal. When <auto-card>Storm Herald</auto-card>'s enters-the-battlefield trigger resolves, you may attach your Auras to any creature you control. It doesn't target. So if you have another untapped creature, say a <auto-card>Satyr Wayfinder</auto-card>, then a single spot removal spell won't break up your combo. That's a big benefit over Abzan Greasefang.</p>

<p>Another benefit is that <auto-card>Storm Herald</auto-card> doesn't target the Auras in your graveyard, so you can run <auto-card>Silent Gravestone</auto-card> in your sideboard to stop your opponent's <auto-card>Graveyard Trespasser</auto-card> and <auto-card>Unlicensed Hearse</auto-card>. Genius!</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/32TsMy6tI1vyocS00bx8i8/9c101a79a09a102a07a399dab94bc524/Grinning_Ignus_combo.jpg" /></div></div><br />

<p>Dimitar Erinin, who finished 17th at the European Championship, showed that <auto-card>Grinning Ignus</auto-card> combo is the real deal. After winning the Warsaw Classic Qualifier—a large RCQ—last month, he took the deck to win the <auto-card>Last Chance</auto-card> Qualifier on Friday in Sofia, and then he promptly went 9-0 on Day 1! Overnght, he found himself on top of the standings as the sole undefeated player in the European Championship. On Day 2, he won enough matches to clinch a Pro Tour invite. If he sticks with the same deck, then he's definitely a player to watch.</p>

<p>So what does the deck actually do? The game plan is to continually cast <auto-card>Grinning Ignus</auto-card> while controlling <auto-card>Birgi, God of Storytelling</auto-card>, <auto-card>Hazoret's Monument</auto-card>, or <auto-card>Runaway Steam-Kin</auto-card>. This generates infinite enters-the-battlefield triggers, which then turns into infinite cards with <auto-card>Risen Reef</auto-card>, infinite life with <auto-card>Prosperous Innkeeper</auto-card>, or infinite damage with <auto-card>Defiler of Instinct</auto-card>. <auto-card>Fauna Shaman</auto-card> from <i>The Brothers' War</i> added a small consistency boost.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/59wMHsYDBirxOVdUj2LttC/7c59a17d103fbd63e54e580d1c65f212/Selesnya_Company.jpg" /></div></div><br />

<p>Grand Prix Sao Paulo 2014 champion Tulio Jaudy is another renowned deck builder, and he made the Top 8 of the Brazil Regional Championship with a spicy brew.</p>

<p>As he explained, "I wanted to play a deck that could play well against all matchups, with aggressive and controlling capabilities, and some toolboxing to help some situations and adapt. Also, it has access to a combo-ish finish, which can outpace the combo decks." Indeed, being able to loop <auto-card>Charming Prince</auto-card> and <auto-card>Yorion, Sky Nomad</auto-card> can overpower anyone, and chaining <auto-card>Chord of Calling</auto-card> into <auto-card>Fierce Empath</auto-card> into <auto-card>Decimator of the Provinces</auto-card> is another sweet combo-esque way to win the game.</p>

<p>Yet the defining feature of his deck are the various disruptive creatures or "hatebears". <auto-card>Phyrexian Revoker</auto-card> stops planeswalkers, <auto-card>Scavenging Ooze</auto-card> eats graveyards, and <auto-card>Voice of Resurgence</auto-card> stops interaction on your turn. <auto-card>Anointed Peacekeeper</auto-card>, which Jaudy mentioned as the best card of his weekend, fills a similar role. "Should've played four copies of it."</p>

They played eight rounds of Pioneer before cutting to a Top 8, where Pedro Mocelin, piloting Rakdos Midrange, emerged victorious. Congratulations to Pedro Mocelin, winner of the City Class Showdown and Brazil's Regional Champion!

Mocelin defeated Jorgemi Sant'Anna, also on Rakdos Midrange, in the finals. In addition to earning a Pro Tour invite, Mocelin's win also secured him an invite to next year's World Championship. Mocelin chose Rakdos Midrange because "I like to stand a chance in all matches and this deck gives me this chance."

# Back to the Gathering

It was a great weekend of Magic around the world as the first set of Regional Championships kicked off. While Mono-Green Devotion was the most played deck at the City Class Showdown, it only put a single copy into the Top 8, and the metagame breakdown also spoke to a format that still has a lot of room for exploration;

# NO REPETITIONS IN THE TOP 8

The format for all Regional Championships this cycle is Pioneer, and it’s proving to be a diverse metagame. The Top 8 decks in Atlanta were all unique, with no repetitions in archetypes. Popular choices like Mono-Green Devotion and Izzet Phoenix clashed with less-played decks like Selesnya Auras.

# TOP 48 PLAYERS QUALIFY FOR THE PRO TOUR

Congratulations as well to the Top 48 players at the DreamHack Magic Showdown for earning invites to Pro Tour I at MagicCon Philadelphia next February!

# BACK TO THE GATHERING

It was a stellar weekend of watching players get back to in-person competitive play all over the world, and we can’t wait to see them all come together at Pro Tour I in Philadelphia next year! 

The Pioneer metagame was wide-open, with some of the most popular decks barely able to break into the Top 8.

On Saturday morning, 409 competitors from the Europe / Middle East / Africa region, mostly qualified via Regional Championship Qualifiers (RCQs), arrived at the Inter Expo Center in Sofia, Bulgaria. After fifteen rounds of Pioneer and a Top 8 playoff, we can say congratulations to our new European champion.</p>

<h1>Miguel Castro Takes the Trophy With Izzet Phoenix</h1>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/8W1Zeq4cdyFxkboXG7uoI/f71b7b6ad1e5b94dd6bce26078a18bd6/euro-champ-cycle-1-2022.png" /><p class="embedImageCaption">Miguel Castro, European Champion</p></div></div><br />

<p>Miguel Castro, a 29-year-old <i>Magic</i> player from Madrid, Spain, was no newcomer to competitive <i>Magic</i>. As a member of team Show &amp; Tell MTG, his previous <i>Magic</i> accomplishments included two Grand Prix Top 8s and six Pro Tour appearances. But becoming the European Champion eclipses all that. It comes with a trophy, $16,000 in prizes, and the ability to call yourself the best <i>Magic</i> player in Europe.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/1E4gewnFck0vgU8vhs4Mpb/bd9c3cc2b4db55bcf99d4705af00bfa7/lec-sofia-castro-finals.png" /><p class="embedImageCaption">Miguel Castro in the finals</p></div></div><br />

<p>Miguel Castro's Pioneer deck was Izzet Phoenix: "It is the deck I used to qualify in an RCQ, and I have played Phoenix in Standard and Modern in the past. After preparing for the event—I came a week before to a testing house with some friends—I was happy with the deck and the plan."</p>

<p>This plan involved <auto-card>Crackling Drake</auto-card> to beat <auto-card>Rest in Peace</auto-card> after sideboard, which is exactly how he won the decisive third game in the finals.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/58lgFlE64LaqIfEJqqqJJc/5118f991c2805c3cfa5ee0eebc785740/lec-sofia-theau-mery-finals.png" /><p class="embedImageCaption">Théau Méry in the finals</p></div></div><br />

<p>In the finals, he defeated Théau Méry, who also prepared for a week in Sofia, in a French testing house. You may know Méry from the podcast "Podcaster Mage" or from his two Grand Prix finals appearances. Since he hails from Nantes, the hometown of Hall of Famer Guillaume Wafo-Tapa, Méry played Azorius Control: "I live in Nantes and as the tradition says and as Wafo says, you got to play it if you live there."</p>

<p>With their performance, Miguel Castro and Théau Méry both earned an invitation to the World Championship in 2023. Congratulations!</p>

<h1>Three Izzet Phoenix Decks in the Top 8</h1>

<p>Congratulations to all <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayMTG/status/1594346469477294082" target="_blank">Top 8 players</a>! The defining deck of the tournament was Izzet Phoenix, which not only won the event but also put three players in the Top 8, all of whom won their quarterfinals.</p>

<p><auto-card>Brotherhood's End</auto-card> for the sideboard was an important addition from <i>The Brothers' War</i>, besides <auto-card>Misery's Shadow</auto-card>, <auto-card>The Stone Brain</auto-card>, <auto-card>Obliterating Bolt</auto-card>, and other cards for other archetypes.</p>

The main way to qualify for the Pro Tour is by placing highly at a Regional Championship, and this weekend features the very first of those!</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/DJPNxAlrmrCNwY5ZB7Fc6/a1e2363f540575f16e5741b149b2280d/1080x1080-Magic-Premier-Play-Path-2022-2023-Infographic.jpg" /></div></div><br />

<p>In today's article, I'll summarize key details of this first round of Regional Championships, and I will provide an overview of the Constructed format, Pioneer, right before the release of <i>The Brothers' War</i>.</p>

<p><b>Format</b>: For all of these first Regional Championships, the format is Pioneer, and <i>The Brothers' War</i> will be legal. (In 2023, the format for the second round will be Standard, and the format for the third round will be Pioneer.)</p>

<p><b>Decklists</b>: Regional Championships will use open decklists, to be submitted by competitors on <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/" target="_blank">MTG Melee</a> on the day before the event starts. Exact details and timing are provided by the local organizer. Once the event gets underway, decklists will become publicly available and you can follow the standings live. To do so, bookmark the MTG Melee pages for the Regional Championships held in <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Tournament/View/12649" target="_blank">U.S.A</a>, <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Tournament/View/12521" target="_blank">Europe</a>, and <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Tournament/View/12349" target="_blank">Brazil</a>. For more updates on the events, follow the regional organizers for <a href="https://twitter.com/DreamHack" target="_blank">U.S.A.</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/LegacyEUTour" target="_blank">Europe</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/CityClassGames" target="_blank">Brazil</a> on Twitter, or keep an eye on our <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayMTG" target="_blank">@PlayMTG account</a>.</p>

<p><b>Invites</b>: Regional Championships are invitation-only events. Most of the invites stem from Regional Championship Qualifiers (RCQs) held at local stores or larger conventions in July, August, and September of this year. On the Friday before each Regional Championship, the event hall can also hold Last Chance Qualifiers. Additional invitees include players who qualified through <i>Magic Online</i> or <i>MTG Arena</i>, members of the 2021-22 <i>Magic</i> Pro League and <i>Magic</i> Rivals League, top challengers from that season, and members of the Hall of Fame who use their "once-per-year" invite. More precise details can be found <a href="https://magic.gg/news/return-of-the-pro-tour-details" target="_blank">here</a>. All in all, the level of competition will be fierce, and many of the best players in each region will be in attendance.</p>

<h1>Pioneer Metagame Snapshot</h1>

<p><a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/formats/pioneer" target="_blank">Pioneer</a> is a nonrotating format based on expansion sets and core sets from <i>Return to Ravnica</i> forward, and the most notable cards on <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/banned-restricted-list#pioneer-banned" target="_blank">the ban list</a> are the fetch lands.</p>

<p>To provide a metagame snapshot that combines popularity and performance, I used decklists from competitive events over the past few weeks. Specifically, I used all available <a href="https://www.mtgo.com/en/mtgo/decklists" target="_blank"><i>Magic Online</i> decklists</a> from Pioneer Preliminary and Pioneer Challenge events held from October 28 through November 15. (Due to publication issues, at the time of writing there were no such decklists available from events held after November 8.) In addition, I used Top 8 decklists from the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/RNGGamesPG/posts/pfbid0ehY49g3uydbd2bfRcMc3fE7kSGQC3TX6r1HPx7NW6kPuH3uv6N2rjuuGcctBjNe4l" target="_blank">RCQ at RNG Games</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/gameshavensg/posts/pfbid0ouU7bdhyL9kC1XzR6dGyk63gea4DpFyX7amErp7xjYCFUb3sRQQPJREqxu6g9P24l" target="_blank">RCQ at Games Haven</a>, and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=548880940578694&amp;id=100063703792050" target="_blank">RCQ at Block 101 Hobbies Store</a>, and I used decklists with at most one more loss than win from the <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Tournament/View/11718" target="_blank">NRG Series $5K Trial Fort Wayne</a>, <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Tournament/View/11888" target="_blank">SCG CON 1 p.m. Trial</a>, <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Tournament/View/11889" target="_blank">SCG CON 4 p.m. Trial</a>, <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Tournament/View/11890" target="_blank">SCG CON $30K RCQ</a>, and <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Tournament/View/11892" target="_blank">SCG CON $5K RCQ.</a> This yielded 687 decks, with archetype labels algorithmically assigned by me.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Congratulations to your <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MTG?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MTG</a> Pioneer $30K champion...<a href="https://twitter.com/BlsmcVinn?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@BlsmcVinn</a> 🏆<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SCGCON?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#SCGCON</a> <a href="https://t.co/1heWMJBQaB">pic.twitter.com/1heWMJBQaB</a></p>&mdash; SCG CON (@SCGCON) <a href="https://twitter.com/SCGCON/status/1591918532270620673?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 13, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>A large source of decklists was last weekend's SCG CON in Philadelphia. It featured several RCQs that awarded invitations for the second Regional Championship, which can be scheduled between February 25 and April 9 in 2023. In the finals of the 288-player $30K event at SCG CON, Vincent Vitanza, playing <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/253665" target="_blank">Gruul Vehicles</a>, defeated Dan Jessup, playing <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/253529" target="_blank">Rakdos Midrange</a>. <auto-card>Skysovereign, Consul Flagship</auto-card> was one of the key cards; in <a href="https://twitter.com/BlsmcVinn/status/1591924184988487681" target="_blank">the words of the champion</a>, "Boat boat boat boat BOOOOOAT!"</p>

<p>But we'll get to the boats later. For each deck I used from SCG CON and the other competitive events, I assigned a number of points equal to its rectified number of match wins minus its number of match losses. For example, a deck that went 5–1 in the Swiss followed by a loss in the quarterfinals was assigned three points. The sum of these numbers for every archetype was then used to determine its record-weighted metagame share, which represents its share of total net wins. In the table below, archetype names hyperlink to a well-performing decklist closest to the aggregate of the archetype.</p>

The number of competitively viable Pioneer archetypes remains enormous.</p>

<p>The most-played nonland cards across all main decks and sideboards were <auto-card>Fable of the Mirror-Breaker</auto-card>, <auto-card>Thoughtseize</auto-card>, <auto-card>Fatal Push</auto-card>, <auto-card>Bonecrusher Giant</auto-card>, <auto-card>Mystical Dispute</auto-card>, <auto-card>Llanowar Elves</auto-card>, <auto-card>Elvish Mystic</auto-card>, and <auto-card>Unlicensed Hearse</auto-card>. These are the true staples of the format.</p>

<p>The breakdown in the above table could be interpreted as a winner's metagame, i.e., a distribution of the types of decks that you could expect to face at the top tables if you were to make a deep run in a Pioneer tournament over the last few weeks. The top four archetypes in the metagame right now are Green Devotion, Izzet Phoenix, Rakdos Midrange, and Mono-White Humans. The biggest developments since <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/feature/metagame-mentor-pioneer-metagame-roundup-october-2022" target="_blank">my previous Pioneer analysis in October</a> are the uptick for Izzet Phoenix, the emergence of Keruga Fires, and the downtick in Rakdos Midrange.</p>

<p>To showcase good, typical lists for all archetypes with at least a 2% record-weighted metagame share, I used a proprietary aggregation method that combines popularity and performance. The core of the method was explained in <a href="https://strategy.channelfireball.com/all-strategy/mtg/channelmagic-articles/magic-math-a-new-way-to-determine-an-aggregate-deck-list-rg-dragons/" target="_blank">an article</a>, but I have since extended it by considering win rates, sideboards, companions, land counts, and other relevant aspects, inspired by the theory behind artificial neural networks. It provides a systematic way to pinpoint the top fourteen "Decks to Beat" in Pioneer right before the release of <i>The Brothers' War</i>. Let's take a look.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Green_Devotion____ece2bcda-3b7f-4f50-b920-cd070aa58f94===

<p>Green Devotion, at 13.8% of the winner's metagame, has been the #1 archetype in Pioneer for a while. With Elves and <auto-card>Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx</auto-card>, you can potentially ramp into a turn-three <auto-card>Storm the Festival</auto-card> and put <auto-card>Karn, the Great Creator</auto-card> and <auto-card>Cavalier of Thorns</auto-card> onto the battlefield. With such raw power, it can go over the top of midrange decks. However, it is weak to blazingly fast aggro decks, which can exploit Green Devotion's lack of creature removal and reliance on expensive spells.</p>

<p>When playing against this deck, you should be aware that Green Devotion is capable of convoluted infinite loops. In tabletop events, I recommend using pen and paper to track your opponent's mana in pool, potential land drop for the turn, the number of <auto-card>The Chain Veil</auto-card> activations, the number of times <auto-card>Karn, the Great Creator</auto-card> has been activated, and the number of times <auto-card>Kiora, Behemoth Beckoner</auto-card> has been activated. This way, you'll make sure the game state remains clear and accurate.</p>

<p><i>The Brothers' War</i> will introduce a lot of cards that could bolster <auto-card>Karn, the Great Creator</auto-card>. New sideboard options include Cityscape Leveler, Haywire Mite, The Stone Brain, Woodcaller Automaton, The Stasis Coffin, The Mightstone and Weakstone, and Portal to Phyrexia. We'll see this weekend which ones deserve a slot and how impactful they are.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Izzet_Phoenix____eeb8a96b-67de-4df0-ba4c-692dfc2c6b71===

<p>Izzet Phoenix, also at 13.8% of the record-weighted metagame, has been on the rise and is now basically tied with Green Devotion in terms of metagame dominance. The game plan is to put multiple <auto-card>Arclight Phoenix</auto-card> into the graveyard, typically via <auto-card>Pieces of the Puzzle</auto-card> or <auto-card>Lightning Axe</auto-card>, and then recur them by chaining three one-mana spells in a single turn. <auto-card>Ledger Shredder</auto-card>, which has edged out <auto-card>Thing in the Ice</auto-card> in most lists, is also a good way to set up your graveyard.</p>

<p>When playing against this deck, try to avoid jamming into <auto-card>Spell Pierce</auto-card> if you can avoid it. It's usually only a two-of, but if your opponent is conspicuously holding a blue mana up, then consider casting a noncreature spell instead. Also, keep in mind that Izzet Phoenix is capable of copying <auto-card>Treasure Cruise</auto-card> or <auto-card>Temporal Trespass</auto-card> with <auto-card>Galvanic Iteration</auto-card>, which is often a game-winning play.</p>

<p><i>The Brothers' War</i> introduces Brotherhood's End, which may be superior to <auto-card>Sweltering Suns</auto-card> from the sideboard. It not only damages planeswalkers but also gives you an out to <auto-card>Unlicensed Hearse</auto-card>. The artifact is a popular sideboard card against Izzet Phoenix, and Brotherhood's End may help to fight back.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Rakdos_Midrange____5e68e4f0-f5dd-42e3-81f4-fc909ff5e31e===

<p>Rakdos Midrange, at 9.5% of the winner's metagame, has been on the downtick over the past few weeks, but it's still the premier traditional midrange deck in Pioneer. Featuring discard, removal, value-generating permanents, and mid-sized creatures, it can take the role of an aggro deck against control players or the role of a control deck against aggro players. Add a flexible sideboard, and Rakdos Midrange has the tools to fight anything, especially creature decks. From <i>Dominaria United</i>, <auto-card>Liliana of the Veil</auto-card> has not lived up to expectations, but <auto-card>Sheoldred, the Apocalypse</auto-card> has established a home in most lists.</p>

<p>When playing against this deck, you should mulligan slightly less aggressively than you otherwise might because you'll need all the resources you can muster. If you mulligan aggressively in search of certain key cards, then that will often be foiled by <auto-card>Thoughtseize</auto-card> and <auto-card>Dreadbore</auto-card>. When they deprive you of further resources with <auto-card>Kroxa, Titan of Death's Hunger</auto-card>, mulligans look even less appealing. Against Rakdos Midrange, you need raw cardboard, so a mediocre seven-card hand is often better than a synergistic six-card hand.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Mono-White_Humans____d86f9995-8a5e-4acc-8652-4e42cecca9fb===

<p>Mono-White Humans, at 8.8% of the record-weighted metagame, is the premier aggro deck in Pioneer. Human tribal decks in Pioneer come in many colors, but all of them rally around <auto-card>Thalia's Lieutenant</auto-card>. The benefit of staying mono-color is that you can effortlessly fit <auto-card>Mutavault</auto-card> and <auto-card>Castle Ardenvale</auto-card> into your mana base and that you can steal games with <auto-card>Brave the Elements</auto-card>.</p>

<p>When playing against this deck, you should always have surprise lethal of <auto-card>Brave the Elements</auto-card> in mind. The instant can not only counter removal spells but also provides a massive burst of damage past your opponent's blockers. <auto-card>Consider</auto-card> blocking and trading off early to avoid the crowded battlefields where the card excels. Also remember that <auto-card>Mutavault</auto-card> is colorless.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Azorius_Control____f4849cdb-6249-4097-a0cc-764f49e61687===

<p>Azorius Control, at 6.7% of the winner's metagame, is the premier control deck in Pioneer. It has all the typical ingredients you might expect: Spot removal, countermagic, card draw, sweepers and planeswalkers. Nearly everyone over the past few weeks opted for a 60-card version, steering clear of <auto-card>Yorion, Sky Nomad</auto-card> to get better consistency.</p>

<p>When playing against this deck, you always have to be wary of sweepers and countermagic. Don't overextend your threats into <auto-card>Supreme Verdict</auto-card>, and sometimes play a cheaper but worse spell to play around <auto-card>Censor</auto-card>. Their exact suite of answers is always changing; lately in Azorius Control main decks, we're seeing more <auto-card>Temporary Lockdown</auto-card> and <auto-card>Make Disappear</auto-card> and fewer <auto-card>Portable Hole</auto-card> and <auto-card>Detention Sphere</auto-card>. In sideboards, <auto-card>Settle the Wreckage</auto-card> has returned as well. Every Azorius Control list is different, but these are relevant aggregate trends.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Lotus_Field____7c52cde2-0140-46c8-989c-86cf7014077b===

<p><auto-card>Lotus Field</auto-card>, at 5.8% of the record-weighted metagame, has made a comeback as the premier combo deck in Pioneer, perhaps with the intention to prey on Izzet Phoenix. The game plan is to find <auto-card>Lotus Field</auto-card>, get another copy via <auto-card>Thespian's Stage</auto-card>, and untap those lands with <auto-card>Hidden Strings</auto-card> and <auto-card>Pore Over the Pages</auto-card>. This allows you to generate loads of mana in a single turn. Through some wild combination of <auto-card>Emergent Ultimatum</auto-card>s, wishes, and tutors, you then generally put <auto-card>Omniscience</auto-card> into play, grab <auto-card>Approach of the Second Sun</auto-card> from your sideboard, and cast it twice to win the game.</p>

<p>From <i>The Brothers' War</i>, The Stone Brain could be a problem for this deck. Previously, <auto-card>Karn, the Great Creator</auto-card> would grab <auto-card>Damping Sphere</auto-card> to nullify <auto-card>Lotus Field</auto-card>, but that artifact was easily destroyed by <auto-card>Boseiju, Who Endures</auto-card>. Now, Karn unlocks The Stone Brain to exile <auto-card>Mastermind's Acquisition</auto-card>, after which the list shown above may no longer be able to win. I'd expect <auto-card>Lotus Field</auto-card> players to add <auto-card>Fae of Wishes</auto-card> // Granted to diversify their win conditions.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Keruga_Fires____d75bcc76-58c6-4a83-8bf4-1545fcfbf43e===

<p>Keruga Fires, at 5.1% of the record-weighted metagame, has rapidly emerged as a prominent archetype over the past few weeks, perhaps also with the intention to prey on Izzet Phoenix. The key cards in the deck are <auto-card>Keruga, the Macrosage</auto-card> and <auto-card>Fires of Invention</auto-card>. <auto-card>Fires of Invention</auto-card> essentially doubles up your mana while allowing you to spend your lands on <auto-card>Kenrith, the Returned King</auto-card>'s activated abilities. <auto-card>Keruga, the Macrosage</auto-card> comes with a substantial companion restriction, but it can create massive card advantage, especially when you control <auto-card>Fires of Invention</auto-card>.</p>

<p>When playing against this deck, remember that their only ways to do something for less than three mana are <auto-card>Bonecrusher Giant</auto-card>'s adventure, <auto-card>Mystical Dispute</auto-card> from the sideboard, and <auto-card>Leyline Binding</auto-card>. Always keep an eye on their domain count because that determines the cost of <auto-card>Leyline Binding</auto-card>.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Bant_Spirits____b73035d1-ff03-4d2c-8e26-592dea42f55e===

<p>Bant Spirits, at 4.3% of the winner's metagame, is the most prominent home for <auto-card>Mausoleum Wanderer</auto-card>, <auto-card>Shacklegeist</auto-card>, and <auto-card>Supreme Phantom</auto-card>. There's also Mono-Blue Spirits with <auto-card>Curious Obsession</auto-card> and <auto-card>Geistlight Snare</auto-card>, which crushed the Explorer rounds of <a href="https://www.magic.gg/events/magic-world-championship-xxviii" target="_blank">World Championship XXVIII</a>, but it has been seeing comparatively less play in Pioneer in recent weeks.</p>

<p>When playing against Bant Spirits, be wary of <auto-card>Spell Queller</auto-card> when they have three mana untapped or four mana for a <auto-card>Collected Company</auto-card>. Think twice before jamming your best spell on turn three into open mana. Likewise, remember that <auto-card>Rattlechains</auto-card> can counter your spot removal spells.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Gruul_Vehicles____889397f6-5719-4773-91e8-817baa7b22a5===

<p>Gruul Vehicles, at 3.5% of the record-weighted metagame, rose to prominence early in October. It's a novel midrange deck whose best draws use <auto-card>Llanowar Elves</auto-card> or <auto-card>Elvish Mystic</auto-card> to ramp into a turn-two <auto-card>Reckless Stormseeker</auto-card>. If you can grant haste to <auto-card>Esika's Chariot</auto-card>, a creature stolen by <auto-card>The Akroan War</auto-card>, or <auto-card>Skysovereign, Consul Flagship</auto-card>, then you'll be dominating the battlefield by turn three or four. <auto-card>The Akroan War</auto-card> is particularly potent against Green Devotion, and <auto-card>Skysovereign, Consul Flagship</auto-card> can singlehandedly defeat Rakdos Midrange.</p>

<p>When playing against this deck, keep a close eye on their companion after sideboard. If they don't reveal <auto-card>Jegantha, the Wellspring</auto-card>, then that generally means that they boarded in <auto-card>Embercleave</auto-card>, so watch out for that. Another interaction to be aware of is that with the third chapter of <auto-card>The Akroan War</auto-card> on the stack, they can tap the stolen creature to crew one of their vehicles.</p>

<p>From <i>The Brothers' War</i>, Obliterating Bolt should be a small upgrade over <auto-card>Lava Coil</auto-card>.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Abzan_Greasefang____5db1aea3-23ad-4c04-8347-1a7d3ddc606a===

<p>Abzan Greasefang, at 3.1% of the record-weighted metagame, is a combo deck with a decent midrange backup plan. The dream is to put <auto-card>Parhelion II</auto-card> into the graveyard on turn two and to crew it with <auto-card>Greasefang, Okiba Boss</auto-card> on turn three. The latest versions have mostly moved <auto-card>Witherbloom Command</auto-card> to the sideboard, instead favoring the duo of <auto-card>Stitcher's Supplier</auto-card> and <auto-card>Eldritch Evolution</auto-card> to increase consistency in the main deck. The archetype has been waxing and waning over the past months based on the popularity of <auto-card>Leyline of the Void</auto-card> and <auto-card>Karn, the Great Creator</auto-card> (which completely shuts down <auto-card>Parhelion II</auto-card>'s crew ability).</p>

<p>When playing against this deck, remember that the best time to kill Greasefang depends on the situation. If they have lots of spare creatures, then kill Gresefang in their main phase before it can trigger. If they have no other pilots, then kill it with the trigger on the stack so that <auto-card>Parhelion II</auto-card> returns to their hand. Also, if you board in <auto-card>Unlicensed Hearse</auto-card>, then consider leaving a 2-power creature untapped so you turn it into a creature in response to a <auto-card>Witherbloom Command</auto-card> that attempts to destroy it.</p>

<p>From <i>The Brothers' War</i>, <auto-card>Diabolic Intent</auto-card> may be an interesting option if you'd want more than four copies of <auto-card>Eldritch Evolution</auto-card>.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Dimir_Control____ce58b85f-d0bc-4a9d-9fd6-6fd47d6ad8e7===

<p>Dimir Control, at 2.8 of the winner's metagame, is a relatively new archetype on the competitive Pioneer stage, with no consensus build whatsoever. There's countermagic, removal, discard, planeswalkers, and card draw, but the precise cards differ a lot. <auto-card>Extinction Event</auto-card> is arguably better than <auto-card>Supreme Verdict</auto-card> in the current metagame because it can exile <auto-card>Old-Growth Troll</auto-card> and <auto-card>Cavalier of Thorns</auto-card>.</p>

<p>When playing against this deck, remember the static ability of <auto-card>Narset, Parter of Veils</auto-card>. Don't discard to <auto-card>Fable of the Mirror-Breaker</auto-card>, and try not to trigger <auto-card>Ledger Shredder</auto-card> on your own turn.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Rakdos_Sacrifice____1eb993a0-dcbc-43df-95bd-a80754dcb53a===

<p>Rakdos Sacrifice, at 2.8% of the winner's metagame, is based on the trio of <auto-card>Mayhem Devil</auto-card>, <auto-card>Cauldron Familiar</auto-card>, and <auto-card>Witch's Oven</auto-card>. Together, it creates a once-per-turn loop that drains your opponent, shoots two damage and lets you block for free. This combo appears in both Rakdos Sacrifice and Jund Sacrifice, but the two-color variant with the cleaner mana base has become more prominent.</p>

<p>When playing against this deck, kill <auto-card>Mayhem Devil</auto-card> on sight and be weary of the latest hotness: <auto-card>Kari Zev's Expertise</auto-card> alongside <auto-card>Village Rites</auto-card>. Not everyone has it, but it's a potent combo especially against <auto-card>Old-Growth Troll</auto-card> or <auto-card>Cavalier of Thorns</auto-card>. To mitigate the impact, keep multiple blockers untapped.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Selesnya_Angels____33967caf-5ed2-4199-8496-1eda2284fc88===

<p>Selesnya Angels, at 2.2% of the winner's metagame, is another tribal deck on the rise. Payoffs for focusing on the Angel tribe include <auto-card>Youthful Valkyrie</auto-card>, <auto-card>Bishop of Wings</auto-card>, and <auto-card>Giada, Font of Hope</auto-card>. <auto-card>Righteous Valkyrie</auto-card> and <auto-card>Resplendent Angel</auto-card> have the right creature type, and they love the life gain provided by <auto-card>Bishop of Wings</auto-card>.</p>

<p>From <i>The Brothers' War</i>, Brushland could be an upgrade for the mana base. Also, Kayla's Reconstruction is worse then <auto-card>Collected Company</auto-card> but still worth considering. For reference, in this deck with 12 two-drops and 15 three-drops, <auto-card>Collected Company</auto-card> would put 1.84 creatures with total mana value 5.0 on the battlefield in expectation, which is a gain of 1.0 mana. Kayla's Reconstruction for X=2 would put 1.91 creatures with total mana value 5.28 on the battlefield in expectation, which is a gain of 0.28 mana. Not great, not terrible.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Enigmatic_Incarnation____ce7e9e50-7e31-4d61-ab5c-abf4204aab72===

<p><auto-card>Enigmatic Incarnation</auto-card>, at 2.2% of the record-weighted metagame, has become a Pioneer mainstay ever since <i>Dominaria United</i> added <auto-card>Leyline Binding</auto-card>. The dream is to cast <auto-card>Leyline Binding</auto-card> on turn two or turn three, followed by <auto-card>Enigmatic Incarnation</auto-card> on turn four. This allows you to turn your six-mana enchantment into <auto-card>Titan of Industry</auto-card>, which will rule the battlefield on turn four.</p>

<p>When playing against this deck, you should generally try to win the game before they draw all colors of mana and deploy their key pieces. When given the chance, they will quickly take over the game with <auto-card>Fires of Invention</auto-card> and <auto-card>Yorion, Sky Nomad</auto-card> from the companion zone.</p>

<h1>Looking Ahead</h1>

<p>In the hands of experienced pilots, all archetypes shown above are capable of doing well at a Regional Championship or RCQ. There is something for everyone, whether you like aggro, midrange, control, ramp, or combo. And I haven't even gotten to some of the more fringe Pioneer archetypes!</p>

<p><i>The Brothers' War</i> will surely also have an impact on Pioneer. I already mentioned several cards while going over the top archetypes, but new archetypes may emerge as well. Brushland could herald the return of Selesnya Aura decks, and there are several enablers for wacky new combos. For example, Gwenna, Eyes of Gaea goes infinite in combination with <auto-card>Acererak the Archlich</auto-card> and <auto-card>Kinnan, Bonder Prodigy</auto-card>. The rewards for breaking the format with a spicy brew are huge, and many Regional Championship competitors will be trying their best. I'm looking forward to seeing everyone's innovations.</p>

<p>As a reminder, the first Regional Championship season will start this weekend with events in <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Tournament/View/12649" target="_blank">U.S.A</a>, <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Tournament/View/12521" target="_blank">Europe</a>, and <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Tournament/View/12349" target="_blank">Brazil</a>. By Sunday evening, nearly 100 players will have made the Pro Tour. I'll be vying for a slot myself, and I'm excited to see who will prove to be the best in their region. To follow along, don't miss the live streaming coverage from U.S.A. and Europe!</p>]]></description></item><item><title>The Week That Was: Regional Championships Rise</title><link>https://magic.gg/news/the-week-that-was-regional-championships-rise</link><guid>https://magic.gg/news/the-week-that-was-regional-championships-rise</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>The Pro Tour is back, and for thousands of competitors across the world the path there continues this weekend at a Regional Championship.</p>

<p>The Pro Tour champions of tomorrow are forged in the tournaments of today, and the path to competitive heights is clearer than it has been in some time. That's best exemplified by the reigning World Champion Nathan Steuer, a 20-year-old who has come from winning local tournaments to winning online tournaments to winning <i>Magic Online</i> Championships to winning <a href="https://magic.gg/news/the-week-that-was-the-greatest-steuer-ever-told" target="_blank">the World Championship at <i>Magic</i> 30 last month</a>.</p>

<p>As competitive play returns to tabletop, the stage is reset in a way almost never seen before in <i>Magic's</i> 30-year history of pro play. There are still plenty of legends in their own right playing the game at the highest levels, but there's no denying that the door is open more than ever before for someone to looking to make their mark on the rejuvenated competitive <i>Magic</i> scene.</p>

<p>For months, players have been hitting the tournament circuit, going from store to store to secure an invitation for the Regional Championship, and a six-week stretch of the best competitors <i>Magic</i> has to offer is about to begin across the globe. That begins with a four-continent kickoff this weekend as players across North and South America, Europe and Asia hit the ground running in our first Regional Championship weekend.</p>

<p>The full schedule looks like this:</p>

<h1>What's at Stake</h1>

<p>The last couple of years have been interesting, to say the least, when it comes to covering competitive <i>Magic</i>. From the introduction of <i>MTG Arena</i> to learning how to make coverage happen in a fully remote world, add in the rotation of the game's top players and teams in that time and you have a world where the previous things I took to be true no longer held up. Grand Prix Top 8s? Still a useful metric, except for the hundreds of players who have made their way up the competitive ranks entirely in a time of online play. <i>MTG Arena</i> lifetime win percentages? How useful is that when you're talking about a proven Hall of Famer?</p>

<p>Without the ins and outs of the weekly grind, fewer events have come to mean more. And even with that we've seen a consistent stream of the new best in the world demonstrate one part of <i>Magic</i> that has always been – and I suspect always will be – true.</p>

<p>One event can change a life.</p>

<p>That's what's on the line when we talk about the Regional Championships to follow, and those are the stories we'll be looking to tell. These aren't just one-off events that award a trophy and some cash – the top players from each Regional Championship will earn themselves an invitation to the first Pro Tour of 2023, taking place February 17-19, 2023 at <a href="https://mcphiladelphia.mtgfestivals.com/" target="_blank">MagicCon: Philadelphia</a>. For some future champion out there, their path to the top of the Pro Tour begins now. Not to mention that there's even more on the line here – some of the very best finishers will also punch their ticket to the next <i>Magic</i> World Championship.</p>

<h1>What to Watch For</h1>

<p>All of which means that for many players these are the biggest events to hit the tournament circuit in years. And at least one <a href="https://twitter.com/Mengu09/status/1591893862511173632" target="_blank">burgeoning chef</a> moonlighting as a <i>Magic</i> champion is treating the Regional Championship in Sofia, Bulgaria with all the attention it deserves.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">On my way to Sofia with <a href="https://twitter.com/PivoUlivo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@PivoUlivo</a> to join the rest of the testing house for the Regional Championship. Excited for this week! 🤩 🇧🇬 <a href="https://t.co/hTqSSWmcIB">pic.twitter.com/hTqSSWmcIB</a></p>&mdash; Andrea Mengucci (@Mengu09) <a href="https://twitter.com/Mengu09/status/1592133828541550593?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 14, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>With the return of the Pro Tour, it only makes sense that someone would resurrect the pro testing house. An age-old tradition that faced a pause during the pandemic is back at the Regional Championships courtesy of ringleader (and Mythic Invitational winner) Andrea Mengucci. Historically, Pro Tours would fall quickly after the release of the latest Standard set, and over the years the biggest teams figured out the best way to get ahead of the field was to lock themselves in a house with the best testing teammates they could find, emerging from seclusion two weeks later with the next format-breaking deck.</p>

<p>And plenty of that happened. But along the way, the testing house experience became more than just a data crunch: it was a rite of passage in the competitive <i>Magic</i> world, and the place where players made some of their most enduring memories whether the process yielded the next Caw-Blade or the tournament's worst deck.</p>

<p>So with the Regional Championship once again bringing together most of the best players across Europe, Mengucci joined forces with former World Champion Javier Dominguez and Portuguese legend Márcio Carvalho to bring things back in style.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/353LTOD4colHh1S48xVIxr/3b93a1fdf4d9f82da31c71aea97db157/281x225-2021-MPL-Andrea-Mengucci-Front.png" /><p class="embedImageCaption">Andrea Mengucci</p></div></div><br />

<p>"We wanted to live the old glory days again and treat this like a true Pro Tour," Mengucci explained. "We've had it. I was able to bring in new people, including my friends Marco del Pivo and Tian fa Mun, who have never lived this experience before and I knew could bring a lot to the team," he said. "Testing has been amazing; I love discovering new things. But walking 30 minutes in the wood in the rain in November wasn't as good!"</p>

<p>For the dozen or so members of the Sofia testing house, that memory will blend in with the hundreds of games of Pioneer they're playing right now, right in between Mono-Green Devotion and the latest serving of #MenguCuisine.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Baccalà con patate. A very traditional way to cook cod, reminds me of both my granmothers. 😊 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/menguccicuisine?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#menguccicuisine</a> 🇮🇹 <a href="https://t.co/Nuu07dqGdx">pic.twitter.com/Nuu07dqGdx</a></p>&mdash; Andrea Mengucci (@Mengu09) <a href="https://twitter.com/Mengu09/status/1591893862511173632?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 13, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>For Mengucci, it's all part of the experience. And as someone who has accomplished so much in <i>Magic</i> – he's won the World <i>Magic</i> Cup, the million-dollar Mythic Invitational, and posted seven Top Finishes in all – it's a return to the experience of the Pro Tour gathering that drives him in <i>Magic</i> right now. Since his incredible run that culminated in an Invitational victory, Mengucci has shifted his focus more to his true passion in <i>Magic</i>: content creation. His articles, "veedeos" and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/andreamengucci" target="_blank">Twitch stream</a> are can't-miss events every week, and he's maintained that success while remaining a world-class competitor at the same time. And with the Pro Tour on the horizon, the Italian is ready to tick a few more boxes off in his illustrious career.</p>

<p>"I hope to qualify for all of the Pro Tours in 2023, but really my true goal is to make it to the [<i>Magic</i>] Hall of Fame," he admitted. "I've been focusing more on work and less on competitive <i>Magic</i>, but I've been waiting for Wizards to bring it back after stopping nominations in 2019."</p>

<p>That motivation has led Mengucci to great heights before, and this weekend could be the first step toward the next milestone. One event can change the course of a career – or kickstart one to ever-greater heights. And with a new wave of players he's showing the ropes to, Mengucci is enjoying the ride.</p>

<h1>All Eyes on Atlanta, Sofia</h1>

<p>While the Regional Championships are the most visible event in years for every region's top players, the next six weeks will also be an extremely interesting stress test of Pioneer. The public consensus of those like Mengucci who are deep in testing for the event is a resulting… shrug.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I’m sure someone out there has a broken pioneer deck for the RCs and is just laughing at all of us who can’t find anything good</p>&mdash; Will Krueger (@Will__Krueger) <a href="https://twitter.com/Will__Krueger/status/1592890557269184513?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 16, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>That raises the stakes even higher for the first weekend of events, when players will square off across four countries and several Twitch broadcasts. It begins with Sofia, which will be streamed at <a href="https://www.Twitch.tv/legacyeuropeantour" target="_blank">Twitch.tv/legacyeuropeantour</a>. The commentators are Matej Zatlkaj, TheWillHallExp, Filipa Carola, and HarryMTG. Soon after, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/DreamHackMagic" target="_blank">coverage will begin in Atlanta</a>.</p>

<p>That's a lot of eyes on a relatively unexplored format still finding its footing. Mono-Green Devotion is undoubtedly the leader in the clubhouse but, by all accounts it's got some weaknesses that players will be aiming to exploit. And how things play out this first weekend is sure to impact things in the weeks ahead, as we look toward large Championship events in Canada and Japan, among others, next week. Looming over it all is the release of <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/products/the-brothers-war" target="_blank"><i>The Brothers War</i></a><i></i>, which is sure to throw a wrench into the format and send players inside testing houses across the world up the wall as they try get an edge on the competition.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Awake at 5.40 AM in the last day of testing for RC. Too many ideas and need much more practice.

<p>The more things change, the more they stay the same. And with the Pro Tour back and the Regional Championships kicking things off in earnest, I couldn't be more excited for it. And some things will never change, no matter how many thousands of games get played in testing houses.</p>

<h1>Standard Metagame Snapshot</h1>

<p><a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/formats/standard" target="_blank">Standard</a> is a rotating format that currently allows expansion sets from <i>Innistrad: Midnight Hunt</i> forward.</p>

<p>To provide a metagame snapshot, I used all <a href="https://www.mtgo.com/en/mtgo/decklists" target="_blank"><i>Magic Online</i> decklists</a> from Standard Preliminary, Standard Qualifier, Standard Showcase Challenge, and Standard Challenge events held between October 19 and November 7. In addition, I used top decklists from <a href="https://magic.gg/events/magic-world-championship-xxviii" target="_blank"><i>Magic</i> World Championship XXVIII</a>, <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Tournament/View/12467" target="_blank">The Pizza Box: Standard Slice</a>, <a href="https://www.hareruyamtg.com/en/deck/result?pageSize=&amp;eventName=&amp;archetypeIds=&amp;dateFrom=2022%2F10%2F19&amp;dateTo=&amp;capacityFrom=&amp;capacityTo=&amp;card=&amp;player=&amp;eventName=%E3%80%90WPN+Premium+Store+Exclusive%E3%80%91Chanpions+Cup+Premium+Quarifier+in+Nagoya&amp;grades=grades&amp;public_status=private" target="_blank">Nagoya Premium RCQ</a>, and <a href="https://gamesquare.tw/game-deck-list.php?id=136" target="_blank">Castelo RCQ</a>. The majority of these tournaments took place after the <a href="https://magic.gg/decklists/magic-world-championship-xxviii-standard-decklists" target="_blank">World Championship decklists</a> were revealed.</p>

<p>By assigning to each deck a number of points equal to its number of match wins minus its number of match losses, I derived the following record-weighted metagame breakdown. It may be interpreted as a winner's metagame that you can expect to see at the top tables. Archetype names hyperlink to a well-performing decklist closest to the aggregate of the archetype.</p>

<p>The most-played nonland cards were <auto-card>Fable of the Mirror-Breaker</auto-card>, <auto-card>Reckoner Bankbuster</auto-card>, <auto-card>Make Disappear</auto-card>, and <auto-card>Cut Down</auto-card>.</p>

<p>Standard has been in a constant state of flux over the past month. At first, after <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/october-10-2022-banned-and-restricted-announcement" target="_blank">the ban</a> of <auto-card>The Meathook Massacre</auto-card> shook up the metagame, Esper Midrange emerged as the Deck to Beat. Indeed, Esper Midrange formed the majority of the <a href="https://magic.gg/decklists/october-2022-qualifier-weekend-day-2-4-win-decklists" target="_blank">4+ win decks from the October Qualifier Weekend</a> and the <a href="https://magic.gg/decklists/magic-world-championship-xxviii-standard-decklists" target="_blank">Standard decks submitted for <i>Magic</i> World Championship XXVIII</a>.</p>

<p>Yet the World Championship also showed that Esper Midrange could be beaten, as Izzet Tempo, Mono-Blue Tempo, and Grixis Midrange all posted positive records against it. We've been seeing more <auto-card>Haughty Djinn</auto-card> decks ever since, and Grixis Midrange has taken over both Jund Midrange and Esper Midrange.</p>

===decklistId:_Nathan Steuer_Magic World Championship XXVIII_10_28_2022_0f5087ce-a25e-4ad7-93f8-5e52a5144b15===

<p><a href="https://magic.gg/news/the-week-that-was-the-greatest-steuer-ever-told" target="_blank">Nathan Steuer</a> not only confirmed that he is the best <i>Magic</i> player in the world right now but also showed that Grixis Midrange was the best way to tackle the October Standard metagame. Relying on the power of <auto-card>Make Disappear</auto-card>, <auto-card>Fable of the Mirror-Breaker</auto-card>, and <auto-card>Invoke Despair</auto-card>, the deck has a small edge against Esper Midrange at the cost of a slightly worse matchup against the rest of the field.</p>

<p>While we saw Grixis Midrange, Esper Midrange, Mono-Blue Tempo, Jund Midrange, and Izzet Tempo at <a href="https://magic.gg/events/magic-world-championship-xxviii" target="_blank">the World Championship</a>, the sixth archetype in today's Standard breakdown is a fresh development.</p>

===decklistId:Esper_Legends_Jujubean__2004___b1e82d61-a1e0-4f3b-b703-148cf060e0be===

<p>Esper Legends is fueled by <auto-card>Plaza of Heroes</auto-card>; <auto-card>Thalia, Guardian of Thraben</auto-card>; and <auto-card>Otawara, Soaring City</auto-card>. These cards enable a completely different take on the color combination. The list shown above has zero noncreature spells to maximize Thalia and a whopping 29 lands to support large numbers of legendary lands.</p>

<p>With enough legendary creatures to reduce the channel cost, <auto-card>Otawara, Soaring City</auto-card> effectively turns into an Island/<auto-card>Unsummon</auto-card> split card, which is worth running four copies of. As always, the lands reveal what is possible in any format, and the deck building possibilities enabled by these legendary lands are still getting explored.</p>

<p>The importance of lands is worth bearing in mind as <i>The Brothers' War</i> enters the format. The new set releases online on Tuesday November 15 and worldwide on Friday November 18. For Standard, I expect that the most important additions will be the nonbasic lands.</p>

<p><auto-card>Brushland</auto-card>, <auto-card>Llanowar Wastes</auto-card>, <auto-card>Underground River</auto-card>, and <auto-card>Battlefield Forge</auto-card> will improve the mana bases of various multicolor decks. <auto-card>Battlefield Forge</auto-card> and <auto-card>Brushland</auto-card> may single-handedly enable Boros Aggro and Selesnya Aggro as viable options. In addition, Fortified Beachhead will enable a white-blue Soldiers archetype, and Mishra's Foundry will boost all kinds of mono-color decks.</p>

<p>The set introduces many powerful spells as well, of course. In particular, the dream of melding Urza, Lord Protector; Mishra, Claimed by Gix; or Titania, Voice of Gaea should get your brewing gears turning. But in the end, mana bases form the foundation of a format, and the consistency at which you can cast your spells or use your mana is the main driver of a deck's competitive viability. Since <i>The Brothers' War</i> introduced many powerful nonbasic lands, I think it will have a large impact on the format, and it'll be exciting to see how Standard will develop.</p>

<br />

<p>The most-played nonland cards were <auto-card>Fatal Push</auto-card>, <auto-card>Thoughtseize</auto-card>, and <auto-card>Fable of the Mirror-Breaker</auto-card>.</p>

<p>In the table, I've added up and down arrows to signify the biggest changes compared to <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/metagame-mentor-pioneer-metagame-roundup-october-2022" target="_blank">last month's Pioneer metagame roundup</a>. As you can see, Izzet Phoenix has been on the rise, whereas Rakdos Midrange and Abzan Greasefang took a plunge.</p>

<p>Yet the biggest news is the re-emergence of two archetypes: Keruga Fires and Dimir Control. They were not a significant part of last month's competitive metagame, but they have risen up in the ranks in recent weeks. If you plan to compete in an upcoming Pioneer event, then it's useful to be aware of these decks.</p>

===decklistId:Keruga_Fires_Pancake_Sock___3f411cf7-c0b4-4553-9f84-a3c87b351291===

<p>Keruga Fires is built around <auto-card>Keruga, the Macrosage</auto-card> and <auto-card>Fires of Invention</auto-card>. <auto-card>Fires of Invention</auto-card> essentially doubles up your mana while allowing you to spend your lands on <auto-card>Kenrith, the Returned King</auto-card>'s activated abilities. <auto-card>Keruga, the Macrosage</auto-card> comes with a substantial companion restriction, but it can create massive card advantage, especially when you control <auto-card>Fires of Invention</auto-card>.</p>

<p>After <i>Dominaria United</i> introduced <auto-card>Temporary Lockdown</auto-card> and <auto-card>Leyline Binding</auto-card>, many players were excited to try these enchantments in <auto-card>Enigmatic Incarnation</auto-card> shells. It took a while for deck builders to catch on to their synergy with <auto-card>Keruga, the Macrosage</auto-card>, but based on recent results, the archetype has legs.</p>

===decklistId:Dimir_Control_Gabriel_Nassif___e024a23c-2830-4d37-a282-d2bdfc29f580===

<p>Hall of Famer Gabriel Nassif started a trend by brewing a Dimir Control deck with <auto-card>Narset, Parter of Veils</auto-card>. Besides a singleton <auto-card>Ertai Resurrected</auto-card>, there aren't any notable gains from <i>Dominaria United</i>, but the color pair has always had a good combination of countermagic, discard, spot removal, card draw. Pioneer even offers <auto-card>Extinction Event</auto-card> as a sweeper.</p>

<p><i>The Brothers' War</i> will surely also have an impact on Pioneer. Besides the lands—<auto-card>Brushland</auto-card> in particular could improve the mana base of Selesnya Aura decks—the set offers various new toolbox artifacts for <auto-card>Karn, the Great Creator</auto-card>. For example, Cityscape Leveler, Haywire Mite, The Stone Brain, Woodcaller Automaton, and The Stasis Coffin. Green Devotion remains on top of the format, and it can only get better.</p>

<p>Another interesting new option is <auto-card>Diabolic Intent</auto-card>, which could enable combos in sacrifice-themed decks. Speaking of combos, how about <auto-card>Phyrexian Portal</auto-card> in a <auto-card>Refurbish</auto-card> deck? Arcane Proxy to copy <auto-card>See the Truth</auto-card>? Gwenna, Eyes of Gaea to go infinite with <auto-card>Acererak the Archlich</auto-card> and <auto-card>Kinnan, Bonder Prodigy</auto-card>? <auto-card>Fauna Shaman</auto-card> in a <auto-card>Prized Amalgam</auto-card> deck? Yotian Dissident in <auto-card>Hardened Scales</auto-card>? There are options aplenty, and with the first Regional Championships fast approaching, the rewards for breaking the format with a spicy brew can be enormous.</p>

<p>To provide a metagame snapshot, I used all <a href="https://www.mtgo.com/en/mtgo/decklists" target="_blank"><i>Magic Online</i> decklists</a> from Modern Preliminary and Modern Challenge events held between October 19 and November 7. In addition, I used top decklists from the <a href="https://events.axionnow.co.uk/Information/GIGAModTop8Oct22" target="_blank">GIGA Modern at Axion Now's The Gathering</a>, <a href="https://www.aarebogemagic.ch/2022/10/28/swiss-magic-masters-2022/" target="_blank">Swiss <i>Magic</i> Masters 2022</a>, <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Tournament/View/11716" target="_blank">NRG Series $5K Trial Newark</a>, and <a href="https://www.magic.gg/news/metagame-mentor-modern-decks-for-the-magic-30-beta-draft" target="_blank"><i>Magic</i> 30 Beta Draft Championship</a>.</p>

<p>The most-played nonland cards were <auto-card>Lightning Bolt</auto-card>; <auto-card>Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer</auto-card>; and <auto-card>Expressive Iteration</auto-card>.</p>

<p>The metagame has not seen major upheavals after <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/october-10-2022-banned-and-restricted-announcement" target="_blank">the ban</a> of <auto-card>Yorion, Sky Nomad</auto-card>. Izzet Murktide put up several good finishes over the past few weeks, and Four-Color Omnath players have embraced different companions.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Izzet_Murktide____f8c59b99-0803-47f9-8133-82eb49852585===

<p>Izzet Murktide remains a good deck choice in Modern, with game against the field. It combines cheap cantrips, efficient interactive spells, and the best one- or two-mana threats in the Izzet colors to quickly overpower everyone.</p>

<p>The main development is that most lists have started to run <auto-card>Blood Moon</auto-card> over <auto-card>Archmage's Charm</auto-card>. Four-color decks like <auto-card>Indomitable Creativity</auto-card> are weak to <auto-card>Blood Moon</auto-card>, and <auto-card>Abundant Growth</auto-card> has been disappearing after the Yorion ban. As a result, <auto-card>Blood Moon</auto-card> is well-positioned right now, and you should keep it in mind when deciding which lands to fetch.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Four-Color_Omnath____57d6c558-7dd1-48af-b932-2710e79246ed===

<p><auto-card>Omnath, Locus of Creation</auto-card> remains exceptionally powerful when combined with fetch lands, and companions other than <auto-card>Yorion, Sky Nomad</auto-card> are viable as well. Four-Color Omnath players have been trying out <auto-card>Kaheera, the Orphanguard</auto-card> and <auto-card>Keruga, the Macrosage</auto-card>, and while there is no consensus yet, Kaheera builds have put up the best numbers so far.</p>

<p>Compared to the 80-card lists of yore, typical cuts have been <auto-card>Ice-Fang Coatl</auto-card>, <auto-card>Abundant Growth</auto-card>, and the <auto-card>Traverse the Ulvenwald</auto-card> package. The aggregate list over the past few weeks is more controlling, featuring spells like <auto-card>Teferi, Hero of Dominaria</auto-card> and <auto-card>Leyline Binding</auto-card>. But given that there are so many different builds going around, this probably isn't even the deck's final form yet.</p>

<p>Modern is a large format, so new expansion sets are unlikely to cause enormous changes. However, Third Path Iconoclast has my attention. <auto-card>Young Pyromancer</auto-card> nearly won <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptrix" target="_blank">a Modern Pro Tour in 2018</a>, and this new variant can be triggered via <auto-card>Mishra's Bauble</auto-card> or <auto-card>Mox Amber</auto-card>. Moreover, it produces artifacts, which boosts your <auto-card>Urza's Saga</auto-card> tokens and helps cast <auto-card>Thought Monitor</auto-card>. In an artifact-centric go-wide brew, Third Path Iconoclast could easily make a Modern impact.</p>

<p>Another thing that is always worth doing when evaluating new sets for Modern is to look for one-mana cards with unique effects, as they might be worth including in decks with <auto-card>Urza's Saga</auto-card> or <auto-card>Chord of Calling</auto-card>. From <i>The Brothers' War</i>, Haywire Mite stands out as an interactive option.</p>

<p>"<i>Magic</i> is many different things to many different people."</p>

<p>That's a phrase I've worn out over the last decade but I've found that not only is it true, it's more true than ever before. Over 30 years of evolution in <i>Magic</i>, the tent has always expanded to welcome in more ways to play the game, more places to play the game, and more people to play the game with.</p>

<p>But even that doesn't do it justice. Because <i>Magic</i> is more than a game. It always has been. It's always been The Gathering, and over time that tent has expanded from Type 1.5 and Type 2 in 2002 all the way to <i>Magic</i> 30 in Las Vegas a few weeks ago, where many of the people in the room were content to play no tournaments at all – they were there to share their love of all things <i>Magic</i>, far beyond the limits of sixties and sideboards.</p>

<p>That much was evident as soon as you walked into the convention hall. Because this wasn't a <i>Magic</i> tournament; even though <a href="https://magic.gg/events/magic-world-championship-xxviii" target="_blank"><i>Magic</i> World Championship XXVIII</a> happened (<a href="https://magic.gg/news/the-week-that-was-the-greatest-steuer-ever-told" target="_blank">and crowned Nathan Steuer its champion</a>), <i>Magic</i> 30 was a celebration of all things <i>Magic</i>, past, present and future. The World Championship was next to a live Commander show, which was the prelude to a packed house for an interview with Richard Garfield himself, which then led into panels about the lore behind the game and the finer details of life on Dominaria.</p>

<p><i>Magic</i> has been many things to many people over the past 30 years. But one thing has been constant: it's always been about the people, not the <i>Magic</i>. And today I want to recognize a few of them who made <i>Magic</i> 30 the spectacle it was, building on the work done by the people who have shaped <i>Magic</i> into the gathering it is today.</p>

<p>Meet Evan Braun. Perhaps better known as <a href="https://twitter.com/DarkPactCosplay" target="_blank">DarkPactCosplay,</a> or as <auto-card>Ashiok, Nightmare Weaver</auto-card>, or as the Milwaukee native who helped to grow <i>Magic</i> in their hometown by putting together free get-togethers for newer players.</p>

<p>Or, as they're known after <i>Magic</i> 30, the winner of best-in-show at <i>Magic</i>'s first large-scale cosplay competition.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Your phobias and doubts have aged like a fine wine, hidden beneath a veneer of resolve. I am here to crack open the bottle. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MagicTheGathering?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MagicTheGathering</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MTG?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MTG</a> <a href="https://t.co/QStLDLPEfN">pic.twitter.com/QStLDLPEfN</a></p>&mdash; Dark Pact Cфsplay, Nightmare&#39;s Muse (he/they) (@DarkPactCosplay) <a href="https://twitter.com/DarkPactCosplay/status/1589710287959363585?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 7, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>"I've been cosplaying since 2017 when my local store in Milwaukee, Open Shield Tavern, did a small cosplay competition. I was immediately hooked by the community of people I met," he recalled. "I loved it. Ever since that night, I've been going to conventions like GenCon and cosplaying."</p>

<p>They've created some amazing cosplays in that time. From the first character Braun worked on for an impromptu cosplay at the LGS, his theater background, ingenuity and more than anything his perseverance has led to some incredible moments.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Since I have so many new followers, I want to introduce myself! I am Dark Pact Cosplay, your local cosplay cult leader. With your devotion and worship, I forge dark and terrible costumes and props from my favorite pieces of fiction. Links to all socials are in my bio! <a href="https://t.co/M83gWNzNs4">pic.twitter.com/M83gWNzNs4</a></p>&mdash; Dark Pact Cфsplay, Nightmare&#39;s Muse (he/they) (@DarkPactCosplay) <a href="https://twitter.com/DarkPactCosplay/status/1587151507358629889?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 31, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>When <i>Magic</i> 30 was announced with a cosplay competition, Braun knew he wanted to be there. But cross-country trips aren't always in the budget–especially when trying to create and travel with large pieces of cosplay apparel–and Braun was resigned to missing the opportunity.</p>

<p>"Then I found out about the <a href="https://magic.gg/news/magiccon-philadelphia-new-perspectives-grant-program" target="_blank">New Perspectives Grant Program</a>, so I applied for that and shared my experience with setting up game nights at the pub for new players," he explained. "I ended up receiving it, which was just wild–never in a million years would I have been able to go if not for that. I'm so thankful for them giving me and the other nine amazing individuals the opportunity."</p>

<p>And Braun made the most of it. They spent weeks planning and preparing the cosplay, and then a furious two weeks before the event making sure everything was ready to go ("con-crunch" was a new term I learned from Braun this week! I'm sure fellow cosplayers can relate).</p>

<p>"I've been playing since <i>Born of the Gods</i>, ever since I first got the intro deck with <auto-card>Eater of Hope</auto-card> on the front," he explained. "I played Standard for a while, and I began watching creators like the Professor and the Command Zone that kept me in the game. Now I'm at <i>Magic</i> 30 getting to meet people I've looked up to for years. I was so star-struck, but amazing, established cosplayers like <a href="https://twitter.com/goberthicks" target="_blank">Olivia Gobert-Hicks</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/TappyToeClaws" target="_blank">Tappy Toe Claws</a> were backstage talking me up the entire time. To have people like that who I've looked up to for years be so nice and wonderful, I was so overwhelmed by how nice and welcoming the community is. I made so many new friends; the overall vibe in the community is amazing and I will always remember that above anything else."</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Of course, there was plenty of <i>Magic played</i> at <i>Magic</i> 30 as well, including one format that those of us who weren't around for drafts in 1993 have never experienced: the <i>Beta</i> draft.</p>

<p>It was a fitting way to celebrate <i>Magic</i>'s 25th anniversary (we even did a <i>Beta</i> draft at the Pro Tour), and as unopened <i>Beta</i> packs become ever rarer, it was a headline event at <i>Magic</i> 30 as well. Tournaments throughout the convention fed into the Top 8 draft, and large crowds gathered around to watch players crack packs that had been sealed for longer than some of them had been alive. And while I can't say much about the gameplay – it turns out Wizards has learned a <i>lot</i> about draft formats in the past three decades – it's undeniably cool to watch players break out the gloves and sleeves and crack some of the packs that started it all.</p>

<p>When the dust settled and the <auto-card>Craw Wurm</auto-card>s and <auto-card>Merfolk of the Pearl Trident</auto-card>s and <auto-card>Hurloon Minotaur</auto-card>s had all done their thing, it was Chas Hinkle who came out on top of the once-in-a-lifetime experience.</p>

<p>"The <i>Beta</i> draft was just about the only reason I made the trip," he explained. "Large conventions aren't really my thing, but I planned on playing multiple qualifiers for the draft."</p>

<p>It only took Hinkle, a 22-year veteran of the game and former Pro Tour competitor with two Grand Prix Top 8s to his name, one qualifier to get there.</p>

<p>"I hadn't done a serious Rochester draft since I don't know when, so that was a nice nostalgia trip and everyone's reaction to the number of basics in packs was pretty entertaining too," he said of the draft. "I was the lucky one whose pack contained a <auto-card>Time Walk</auto-card> in the second pack opened, and to top it off I got to draft a deck full of X spells so it was a ton of fun to play. As far as winning, it was a major rush. It was by far my most successful finish in the 20+ years I've been playing <i>Magic</i>."</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Finally back home after a great weekend in Vegas.

<p>Two <i>Magic</i> 30 stories with two very different motivations, bound together by the magic of the gathering. That's what the celebration of Magic's 30 years was, all set to the backdrop of the World Championship and the rich history of the Pro Tour. And like those who came before them, Braun and Hinkle and Steuer are adding their own chapters to <i>Magic</i>.</p>

<p>There's room enough for everyone in this gathering—and it's "the gathering" that helps us remember.</p>

<p><i>(Note: Kazuyuki Takimura remembrance provided by Wizards of the Coast.)</i></p>

<p>With the return of the Pro Tour at <a href="https://magic.gg/news/magiccon-philadelphia-and-the-2023-magiccon-schedule" target="_blank">MagicCon Philadelphia</a>, gatherings grow once more with the best tabletop <i>Magic</i> players in the world meeting—and battling—to become the next champion. From across the world, connections form that reach beyond the tournaments as friendships are forged.</p>

<p>Recently, one of Japan's greatest players passed. Kazuyuki Takimura may be renowned for winning Pro Tour <i>Battle for Zendikar</i> in 2015 but his accomplishments extend far deeper into the Japanese <i>Magic</i> community.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/6xzttWHCTUHXdbBNj1DYMk/211681fae69c1bf17cb6f5a1eb148593/1920x1280-Kazuyuki-Takimura-Pro-Tour-BFZ-Winner-Trophy.jpg" /><p class="embedImageCaption">Kazuyuki Takimura, winner Pro Tour Battle for Zendikar</p></div></div><br />

<p>In addition to his five Grand Prix Top 8, including at win at Grand Prix Kyoto 2016 with teammates Yuki Matsumoto and Yuuki Ichikawa, Takimura shared his skill and helped build Team Kusemono for the Pro Tour Team series—packed with some of Japan's greats. That team continued on into online play and ushered to the stage more strong players, such as Riku Kumagai, that continue the excellence Takimura exemplified.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/3o4W56xWL6BrmBnIq0URrH/b71937d03320ca9bd59e1709e0e5c23d/1920x1280-Kazuyuki-Takimura-Pro-Tour-BFZ.jpg" /></div></div><br />

<p>Our hearts and condolences are with Takimura's family and the Japanese <i>Magic</i> community after his passing.</p>

<p><i>(Note: Remembering Mort provided by Brian David-Marshall.)</i></p>

<p>The <i>Magic</i> coverage family lost someone very dear to us recently. The name John "Mort" Mortensen might not be well known to even the most die-hard follower of Pro Tour coverage over the years, but if you followed any cable from any camera, microphone or steady-cam to the backstage area they would all lead to Mort's chair. He was the person—along with his hand-picked, amazingly talented Think-a-Tron team—that made it all work. And to be clear: Mort was at the vanguard of streaming game play long before the term "esports" was ever coined.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/31ClbjEBLOK4SviYln4gXQ/7d8140c36ba5cc13da3ad11525ea04cb/1024x1365-Mort-Think-A-Tron-Chair.jpg" style="width: 450px;" /></div></div><br />

<p>When I arrived on the coverage scene Mort was already there. An irascible curmudgeon who made it possible to watch some of the greatest moments in the history of <i>Magic</i> and not just read about them. And he continually pushed the envelope on what was possible. What started out as downloadable video files on the Wizards website grew up to become embedded YouTube links. Text articles about how a deck worked became an on camera discussion with the deck's designers from the floor of the event. And eventually those short videos and Top 8 coverage became live streams with multiple studios that ran from before Round One until the winner's interview.</p>

<p>Someone who worked closely with Mort and his team throughout a lot of that evolution was Wizards of the Coast Play Studio member Mike Rosenberg.</p>

<p>"Mort was more than a technical director for <i>Magic</i> coverage in all of its iterations from era to era of tournament systems. He was instrumental in the development of the news desk as we moved to the live broadcasting medium back in 2012, and over the years continued to find ways to evolve the approach to covering Swiss-style tournaments with multiple rounds each day over each iteration of the <i>Magic</i> Pro Tour's coverage," Rosenberg shared. "One such innovation was with equipment to detail clearer, legible board states and to allow for zoom to see and even read <i>Magic</i> cards present on a table from the overhead. This technical concept was put into full effect during Pro Tour 25th Anniversary when broadcasting the <i>Magic: The Gathering</i> Beta Rochester Draft live and, later, in various feature matches and events beyond that, zooming in on complex board states to break down the sheer number of creatures and other cards present and active in a game."</p>

<p>In addition to being at the cutting edge with his technical direction, Mort had an entire other side of him touring the world as a musician with his band The Mono Men, a hugely influential act that grew out of the Pacific Northwest punk and grunge scenes. He was often flying off from Pro Tours in one far-flung location to some other corner of the globe to tour with his band for throngs of adoring fans. He was a rock star in all senses of the word—but he never acted like one.</p>

<p><i>Magic: The Gathering</i> Hall of Famer Randy Buehler was someone who, as a commentator in the booth, worked with Mort throughout his career in coverage.</p>

<p>"His secret history as a grunge musician was not something he ever brought up, but totally made sense to me when I learned about it. I still can't believe he's gone," Buehler said.</p>

<p>Mort was punk in the absolute best sense of that word. He did not suffer fools gladly, he would always figure out how to cut through the bullshit (I am owed one curse word from my time on coverage and I will cash it in here) and get stuff done, and ultimately his gruff exterior contained a deep well of friendship, loyalty, and creativity. And if you were a member of the coverage team putting yourself out there you could have no better champion on your side, even if behind the scenes you strained his patience just a little bit.</p>

<p>Pro Tour commentator, and host of the Limited Resources podcast, Marshall Sutcliffe recounted one of his first times working with Mort.</p>

<p>"I remember doing one of my first shows with him, and he was so nice and encouraging and made sure I was comfortable on air," Marshall explained. "But then he forgot to switch his mic off and cursed about me moving or looking at the wrong camera or something, but he didn't know I could hear it. Then he came back on with me and was super nice and encouraging. It was so funny because it gave me a glimpse of all the crap he was dealing with me being new and not really getting it yet, but he never let me know, at least not on purpose. I told him that I had heard what he said and we both laughed about it after. I'll miss him."</p>

<p>Someone else Mort worked closely with was Deb Slater. Deb was his right hand on the Pro Tour and a dear friend to him away from it. She has organized a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/in-memory-of-mort" target="_blank">GoFundMe</a> for Mort's daughters and her words about Mort's crowning achievement in a storied career are a perfect note to end this memorial with.</p>

<p>"John will be remembered as an esteemed trailblazer in his professional field of video production, a rock star in the music world and an amazing friend," Slater shared. "But the most important role to him was as a loving father of his two daughters, Madeline and Annabelle."</p>

<p>SCG events began in 2009 with tight event halls and tighter budgets as they sought to recreate the success previously seen only by the Wizards-sponsored Grand Prix circuit. It was a bold endeavor in a period of economic uncertainty, and it was a risk that they took in the name of growing the game. The first advertised SCG Open was in April at SCG's home in Roanoke, Virginia, and the prize pool was $1,000.</p>

<p>Things have changed quite a bit since then.</p>

<p>For starters, the SCG circuit—now known as SCG CON—is the largest and most well-known in North America. It has been the home for the rise of now-household <i>Magic</i> names. Frankly, there's way too many players here to highlight without leaving out someone I should name, so instead I'll just share the story of one player who lived the promise the SCG circuit offered at a time when there were few other options.</p>

<p>Brian Braun-Duin was a Friday Night <i>Magic</i> kind of player when he began. Like many of you reading this, he eventually dipped his toes into the next step—a PTQ in his area. When the SCG series came around, he gave it a shot.</p>

<p>It didn't go great for him. He lost, sometimes a lot. It was at times a harsh reminder that there were levels in competitive <i>Magic</i>, and he had a long way to go; not everyone is born into the game a <i>Magic</i> prodigy like many of those whose names have graced Pro Tour Top 8s at a young age.</p>

<p>But it was the perfect steppingstone experience for someone looking to level up their game, and BBD kept at it. He was the quintessential SCG grinder, traveling across the country with the circuit and battling week in and week out in a way that tested skills that even the Pro Tour didn't necessarily test. It was a long journey for Braun-Duin, and he documented it extensively in weekly writing as he shared his sometimes-harrowing tales of the work it took to truly improve, even if it was often a tumultuous trajectory.</p>

<p>But improve he did. A lot. And he rose to the top of the SCG ranks. Then the Pro Tour ranks. Then, in 2016, Brian Braun-Duin won the <i>Magic</i> World Championship.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/7g7f8en5rSDbAcr6Gz2uqQ/58b7fa44322abeaab28d9a55da5a9617/BBD-2016wc-trophy_1_.jpg" /><p class="embedImageCaption">Brian Braun-Duin, 2016 Magic World Champion</p></div></div><br />

<p>That's the pedigree the SCG circuit brings to every event—the knowledge every entrant has that <i>Magic</i> stars were forged in these battlefields, and that you're just as likely to play against a well-known pro or content creator as you are your friend who made the car ride with you to the event. It's a cachet that has only grown over the years, because while BBD may be the best example of the benefits of playing these tournaments, he's far—<i>far</i>—from the only one-day Pro Tour Top 8 member or winner who got their start on the SCG streets.</p>

<p>Which brings us to today, SCG CON Columbus and Brady Munroe.</p>

<h1>Munroe's Modern Mastery</h1>

<p>As the return of tabletop <i>Magic</i> events has played out, SCG CON has played a key role for North American competitors, and a few weeks ago in Columbus that meant a full trio of high-stakes Modern tournaments. Large prize pools and Modern means a selection of the game's best will turn out to compete, and Columbus was no exception. Pro Tour competitor (when he's not busy being entertaining as heck in the commentary booth) Corey Baumeister was one of several accomplished players to add another big finish to their resume along with Pete Ingram and Ross Merriam, all of whom were piloting a version of the <auto-card>Underworld Breach</auto-card> combo deck that <a href="https://magic.gg/news/the-week-that-was-the-very-model-of-a-modern-major-series" target="_blank">Jesse Robkin took the finals using at an NRG Open</a> a few weeks earlier.</p>

<magic-cards>
  Underworld Breach
</magic-cards>

<p>Those are players you may have heard of. They have long resumes and Top 8s in more cities than they can remember. But like I said, the biggest draw of these events to me is the newer players following in the footsteps of the many who came before them.</p>

<p>That's where Munroe comes in. His passion for card games was sparked as a child, and he grew up playing <i>Yu-Gi-Oh!</i> with friends at his local game store, Alternate Universes. When <i>Magic</i> eventually made its way into his life back in 2019, he was ecstatic to find out there was a path toward high-stakes tournaments and a dream he could watch come true for someone at the Pro Tour every few months. Like BBD before him, Munroe's own ascent had begun.</p>

<p>Three years later, he's a champion. Munroe won the massive $20,000 Modern tournament in Columbus, and his story is proof that the role the SCG circuit has served players for almost fifteen years is still going strong.</p>

<p>"The first set I drafted was <i>Rivals of Ixalan</i>—I already had a big competitive drive from playing <i>Yu-Gi-Oh!</i> for many years, so I was equally interested in playing <i>Magic</i> tournaments with higher and higher stakes," Munroe recalled. "That summer, I made Top 8 at a modern PPTQ, and in fall of 2019 I finished second in a <i>Magic Online</i> Modern challenge. A few more Top 8s and together this progression solidified the idea to myself that I was good at Constructed."</p>

<p>All of which came just in time for competitive <i>Magic</i> play to move to online venues, and as the landscape around the game changed, Munroe continually adapted. He served as the president of the <i>Magic</i> club at Carnegie Mellon University—an institution that was the home to future <i>Pro Tour</i> Hall of Famers and champions in <i>Magic</i>'s early competitive days.</p>

<p>When in-person events began to return earlier this year, Munroe saw a renewed opportunity to live out those <i>Magic</i> dreams delayed and jumped right in.</p>

<p>"The majority of larger events that I have traveled to in the past couple of years have been SCG events," he explained. "And I am glad that they host these conventions, because one of the best parts of <i>Magic</i> is the gathering—the ability to see a bunch of friends and meet new cool people, and hang out for an entire weekend is amazing. I've been actively looking for various Constructed tournaments to play in, both local weekend 1-2ks, and reasonably drivable larger events such as the SCG CON event and the Legacy Pit Open."</p>

<p>Munroe was looking for a new weapon of choice in Modern for Columbus, and as he drifted in and out of Izzet Murktide and tried out various flavors of Modern combo, he flashed back to a deck he had enjoyed in the past.</p>

<p>"I knew that I really enjoyed playing artifact prison decks, so I decided to try out prison Tron; the third Modern deck I played ever was UG/UR Whir of Invention Prison, which helped me fall in love with artifacts and <auto-card>Ensnaring Bridge</auto-card> in particular," Munroe explained. "Then when <auto-card>Oko, Thief of Crowns</auto-card> came out that fall, the deck became significantly worse, so I switched over to the Urza/Emry/Jeskai Ascendancy combo deck until <auto-card>Mox Opal</auto-card> was banned), which so far is my favorite Modern deck that I have played."</p>

<magic-cards config="fan">
  Karn, the Great Creator
  Ensnaring Bridge
  Mystic Forge
  Chalice of the Void
</magic-cards>

<p>"So, to specifically prepare for this tournament, I used various lists posted on MTGGoldfish as well as some of the sentiments shared by other Prison Tron players from the artifact prison Discord. Pretty soon before the event, I decided that I wanted to play a copy of <auto-card>Warping Wail</auto-card>, which I was thankfully able to borrow from my carmate Brian Coval."</p>

<p>It worked, <auto-card>Warping Wail</auto-card> and all. Munroe finished third after the Swiss rounds, and after a tight three-game match against Five-Color Indomitable Creativity in the quarterfinals, Munroe posted back-to-back 2-0 victories to take the title.</p>

===decklistId:Prison_Tron_Brady_Munroe___3cd4172d-a9bb-478e-a0f7-21c058a35a17===

<p>With his best finish to date now under his belt, Munroe is looking toward the future and the Pro Tour he can now reach—and he aspires to add his name to the list of greats who got started with a Top 8 SCG run.</p>

This was, after all, the biggest match of his life and the one that would define his future as a competitive <i>Magic</i> player, and coming against one of the best players in the room. This was a moment where champions were made, stars rising to the occasion or falling to the wayside in their pursuit of the <i>Magic</i> World Championship.</p>

<p>So with barely contained nerves, Steuer sweated every draw step as if it were his last. Agonized over every decision, every attack or block. Played like everything was on the line, like he was at the World Championship and playing against a Hall of Famer like Reid Duke.</p>

<p>The year was 2015, and young Nathan Steuer was playing in his first-ever Grand Prix Day Two.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/6taCpZS4HHxMU3VobJqnql/8bd3b355d7d6968639d79e65b8cd5c46/1920x1280-Nathan-Steuer-Day-2-Grand-Prix-San-Diego-2015.jpg" /><p class="embedImageCaption">Nathan Steuer, Day 2 Grand Prix San Diego 2015</p></div></div><br />

<p>And while he may have only been at the World Championship in his mind, he <i>was</i> playing against Hall of Famer Reid Duke.</p>

<p>"That's what I remember most about [Grand Prix San Diego 2015], getting a feature match and then beating Reid for the best finish of my career," Steuer recalled. "That was the first time I remember feeling like I could beat a really good player.</p>

<p>"Now I'm playing next to him at the World Championship."</p>

<p>It's been quite the journey for the <a href="https://magic.gg/events/magic-world-championship-xxviii" target="_blank"><i>Magic</i> World Championship XXVIII</a> winner.</p>

<p>Steuer first picked up <i>Magic</i> at summer camp in 2010 and rose through the ranks of competitive play. Soon he was playing six or seven days a week at his local game store, and it wasn't long before Grands Prix, <i>Magic Online</i>,<i></i> and <i>MTG Arena</i> play followed.</p>

<p>Steuer is the rare case of a "prodigy" who not just lived up to expectations but blew past all of them–including his own. Even at that first Grand Prix Day Two against Duke all those years ago Steuer was pegged among the next generation of elite <i>Magic</i> players, and he took that to heart. He sought out guidance from those better than him, he practiced with other up-and-coming players in his area, and all along he nurtured a dream that snuck into his mind in those tense moments against one of his <i>Magic</i> idols in Duke.</p>

<p>That formative experience was fresh in his mind during the closing rounds of <i>Magic</i> World Championship XXVIII, when he faced down Hall of Famers, seasoned World Championship competitors, and opponents of the highest caliber in every round.</p>

<p>"The World Championship was as mentally taxing as it was anything else," Steuer said, introspective in the days following his incredible run from the lower bracket to <a href="https://magic.gg/news/title-match-of-magic-world-championship-xxviii" target="_blank">defeat Eli Kassis in the finals</a>. "Every round was such an intense experience, and it was a battle. It feels incredible to have gone through all of that and to have won ... it's an actual dream or fantasy, even, that I've had since I started playing and discovered I could qualify for the Pro Tour."</p>

<p>For 12 years those who know Steuer best watched him give everything he had to <i>Magic</i>. And at the World Championship, with all its bells and whistles on display, they finally had the opportunity to watch the game give something back: the fulfilment of a dream that's occupied more than half of Steuer's life.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">My nephew <a href="https://twitter.com/Nathansteuer1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Nathansteuer1</a> is KICKING BUTT at the Magic:The Gathering world championships! We are watching on Twitch, uncomprehending yet very proud!</p>&mdash; Marjorie Ingall (@MarjorieIngall) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarjorieIngall/status/1586865353476513792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 30, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>It was a dream so close to Steuer's heart, he couldn't bring himself to think about it during his incredible run. He wore his emotions on his sleeve throughout the tournament, including in a memorable moment after he lost what was a win-and-in for the Top 4. When he dropped that match, he saw his World Championship hope fade before his eyes—and with it that dream born 12 years ago.</p>

<p>But history—and his tiebreakers—were on his side. Steuer made the Top 4 of <i>Magic</i> World Championship XXVIII despite the final-round loss, and the rest became history. Just history the 20-year-old kept as far from his mind as possible.</p>

<p>"Honestly, I spent a lot of energy <i>not</i> thinking about the idea of winning the World Championship," he explained. "I feel like I fought the whole weekend to keep my mind in check. It was amazing with the World Champs and the stage and everything, but I wanted to keep my focus on playing <i>Magic</i> like I have all year.</p>

<p>"Even going into the finals, it was something I pushed out of my mind. It wasn't until the very final game, when I was in a good spot on board, that I started to let myself consider it."</p>

<p>In other words, Steuer may have been the last person at the World Championship to realize what has become more and more obvious over the past two years as the American has taken down online tournament after online tournament – two <i>Magic Online</i> Champions Showcase titles attest to that – and he cruised through the most challenging rounds of <i>Magic</i> imaginable in the World Championship.</p>

<p>Nathan Steuer is the best player in the world right now.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/522xprjvUsFrdRGzsJL26L/a22f87ecdc4c32415320438715f2461c/1920x1280-Steuer-battles-in-the-Upper-Semifinal-match-of-Magic-World-Championship-XXVIII.jpg" /><p class="embedImageCaption">Steuer battles in the Upper Semifinal match of Magic World Championship XXVIII.</p></div></div><br />

<p>In a world of storied <i>Magic</i> professional careers that span decades and reputations that are often measured in years rather than months, it's rare for such a major tournament to showcase a transition so starkly. <i>Magic</i> World Championship XXVIII featured its share of past Pro Tour winners and Hall of Famers, but it also featured a host of younger players who grew up hoping for the chance to be paired against Reid Duke and have now come of age in the <i>MTG Arena</i> era of competition.</p>

<p>The 32-player World Championship field was filled with the best of this bunch. Steuer has spent the lsat few years testing with a handful of notable young players who also qualified for the World Championship, including David "Tangrams" Inglis, Sam Rolph, and Simon Nielsen. The shift captivated the competitive <i>Magic</i> world and is sure to be a dominant storyline again as we look toward the Pro Tour in 2023.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I’m just a fanboy here while those kings do their work.</p>&mdash; Michael Sigrist (@MSigrist83) <a href="https://twitter.com/MSigrist83/status/1586183920982204416?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 29, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Steuer has what even the best <i>Magic</i> professionals spend a lifetime chasing but never achieve. A World Championship changes things in a way no other tournament can, so what's next for the reigning champ?</p>

<p>Not all that much has changed since 2015.</p>

<p>"I want to win a Pro Tour," he said with a laugh. Premier competitive tabletop play will be found at <a href="https://twitter.com/wizards_magic/status/1586900840551714816" target="_blank">Magic Con Philadelphia</a> with the return of the Pro Tour. "I really want to Top 8 one, and winning one would kind of be the last thing to check off the list. But I'll start with practicing for the first Pro Tour back next year and doing everything I can to work at it like I did the World Championship, and hopefully make it to a Top 8."</p>

<p>Modest enough, coming from a player who has thus far achieved every goal he has set his sights on in competitive <i>Magic</i>. But as he already looks ahead to the next event, he's also finding more time to explore other aspects of <i>Magic</i> he hasn't had the chance to while chasing the World title.</p>

<p>"I've found that I really enjoy the teaching aspect of <i>Magic</i>," he explained. "When I was coming up, I had a lot of help from good players and adults around me who helped me play in events and level up my game. Now I'm spending more time coaching and doing the same for other players."</p>

<p>In the immediate future, we can expect more of the same from Steuer. He was already qualified for next year's <i>Magic</i> World Championship even before winning this year's—yes, he's now <i>double</i> qualified—and he remains the most accomplished player on the best testing team in the world. With so many titles under his belt, the <i>Magic</i> world in 2023 will be defined by Steuer and his peers, just like 2022.</p>

<p>Well, with maybe one difference.</p>

<p>"I cannot wait to have my face on a card that will hopefully be competitive!" Steuer gushed. "I've seen previous winners get to <a href="https://magic.gg/news/the-elite-spellbinder-paulo-vitor-damo-da-rosa" target="_blank">play with the card they designed</a>, and it's an amazing thing. I had my first planning call with Wizards on the card this week, and that's when it really began to sink in that I was the world champion."</p>

<p>Nathan Steuer, one of the youngest members of the <i>Magic</i> World Championship XXVIII field, had risen through the ranks of competitive play online over the past few years. But his main previous successes were on <i>Magic Online</i>, where he had won the prestigious Champions Showcase twice. Last weekend, he was able to prove that he's also the best of the best at the highest possible competitive <i>Magi</i>c stage. You can find all the details on the <a href="https://magic.gg/events/magic-world-championship-xxviii" target="_blank"><i>Magic</i> World Championship XXVIII event coverage page</a>, but he impressed everyone by navigating complicated matchups with a level of skill befitting a World Champion.</p>

<p>To clinch the trophy and to have the honor of having his likeness feature on a future <i>Magic</i> card, he had to display mastery in both Standard and Explorer. In Standard, the most popular deck by far was Esper Midrange. It went 19-19 in non-mirror matches throughout all the World Championship Standard rounds. Many of those losses were at the hands of Nathan Steuer and <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/251300" target="_blank">his Grixis Midrange deck</a>; <auto-card>Corpse Appraiser</auto-card> turned out to be an excellent way to break the metagame. <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/251335" target="_blank">Izzet Tempo</a> and <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/251342" target="_blank">Mono-Blue Tempo</a> went 3-0 against Esper Midrange, so <auto-card>Haughty Djinn</auto-card> was a good choice as well. Jund Midrange and Jund Reanimator went 0-5 and 1-6 respectively against Esper Midrange, so they turned out to be poor choices for the field.</p>

<p>In Explorer, Mono-Blue Spirits was the best deck choice for the field by far. With a 17-5 non-mirror record, it put multiple players into the Top 4 playoffs. Most other archetypes hovered around the 50% winrate mark, with small sample sizes making it difficult to point out significant results. <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/251330" target="_blank">Rakdos Midrange</a>, however, had the worst performance of all: 0-6 against the field. While Explorer differs from Pioneer—for example, Nythkos, Shrine to Nyx is not legal, which means fewer Devotion decks with <auto-card>Karn, the Great Creator</auto-card>, more artifact-reliant decks that crush Rakdos Midrange, and fewer anti-Devotion aggro decks that are weak to Rakdos Midrange–I have to imagine that the metagame in both Explorer and Pioneer will shift towards less Rakdos Midrange. Also, even though <auto-card>Spell Queller</auto-card> is not available in Explorer, fans of the tribe may want to give another look at Mono-Blue Spirits in Pioneer, as <auto-card>Curious Obsession</auto-card> can single-handedly win games.</p>

<h1>The Modern Qualifiers for the <i>Magic</i> 30 <i>Beta</i> Draft</h1>

<p>While Nathan Steuer was winning the World Championship, there was another major event on the other side of the <a href="https://magic.gg/news/magic-30-tickets-and-events-details" target="_blank"><i>Magic</i> 30</a> event hall: the <i>Magic</i> 30 Championship. Friday and Saturday featured four 224-player Modern qualifiers, making for nearly 1000 entrants in total, and the Top 8 from each qualifier advanced to the Top 32 on Sunday.</p>

<p>After two brutal single-elimination rounds, again with their Modern decks, the last eight standing on Sunday then get to the <i>Limited Edition Beta</i> Rochester Draft. In Rochester Draft, players take turns drafting from all cards opened in a booster pack, and all picks are known by each player. It's a high skill way to draft as there's no hidden information of what cards were opened and who may be playing them.</p>

<p>It was quite a spectacle, as iconic cards like <auto-card>Time Walk</auto-card>, <auto-card>Plateau</auto-card>, and <auto-card>Underground Sea</auto-card> were opened to the cheers of the crowd.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">8 players will soon be opening these <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Magic30?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Magic30</a> <a href="https://t.co/cbNqCpHEkf">pic.twitter.com/cbNqCpHEkf</a></p>&mdash; ⌽✯ 𝕋𝕙𝕖𝕎𝕚𝕝𝕝ℍ𝕒𝕝𝕝𝔼𝕩𝕡 ✯⌽ ➡️ Magic30 (@TheWillHallExp) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheWillHallExp/status/1586826191557709824?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 30, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>I received the paper Modern decklists of almost all 32 players who advanced to Sunday, and I'm excited to share them in this article today. First, here is the overall metagame breakdown.</p>

<br />

<p>Based on these results, <auto-card>Indomitable Creativity</auto-card> and Jeskai Breach are the Decks to Beat in Modern now. Both put many players in the Top 32, plus two in the Top 8. Rakdos Undying, Hammer Time, and Rhinos all put up solid results as well.</p>

<p>One of the biggest surprises was Merfolk, which put two players in the Top 8. The archetype has been growing in popularity ever since <i>Dominaria United</i> added <auto-card>Vodalian Hexcatcher</auto-card>, and this weekend marked its breakout. If you venture into a Modern tournament now, then be sure to factor in the possibility that an untapped <auto-card>Aether Vial</auto-card> on two counters may result in your noncreature spells getting countered.</p>

<p>Another surprise was a relatively poor showing of Izzet Murktide, Yawgmoth, and <auto-card>Living End</auto-card>. I don't know if they simply weren't popular in the qualifiers or whether they were unable to convert into the Top 32, but I had expected to see more of them.</p>

<p>In the remainder of this article, I'll provide all available decklists, grouped by archetype. I included the names of only the players who made the Top 8 because many others were not properly legible. The decklists that I received contained one duplicate, which I removed, and missed one Jeskai Breach player that <a href="https://twitter.com/TheWillHallExp/status/1586820246559604737" target="_blank">other sources</a> indicated had made the Top 8. So, I operate under the assumption that these two paper decklists were unfortunately swapped while collecting them for this article. Additional errors may not be impossible, but I was able to independently verify most lists as belonging to Sunday competitors. In any case, the remaining 31 decklists give an excellent snapshot of the current Modern metagame.</p>

<h1>Indomitable Creativity</h1>

===decklistId:Indomitable_Creativity_Justin_Rouse_Top_8__af1bed87-a8e7-4265-97df-30616a77c29b===

===decklistId:Indomitable_Creativity_Wan_Tingfeng_Top_8__6637f33a-177b-492e-885d-01bdeb5b04ed===

===decklistId:Indomitable_Creativity__Top_32_at_the_Beta_Draft_Qualifier__57ff3516-7f0b-49e4-8e42-7de5217f948d===

===decklistId:Indomitable_Creativity__Top_32_at_the_Beta_Draft_Qualifier__1cb45146-0451-427a-9857-8b84e81bd711===

===decklistId:Indomitable_Creativity__Top_32_at_the_Beta_Draft_Qualifier__9530b3bb-c2d9-4bfd-ba2c-612c13f87413===

<p><auto-card>Indomitable Creativity</auto-card> is a top-tier deck in the current Modern metagame. The game plan is to fetch for <auto-card>Dwarven Mine</auto-card>, then use the namesake spell to transform the 1/1 token into a game-winning creature. <auto-card>Archon of Cruelty</auto-card> is the most common one. Thanks to <auto-card>Leyline Binding</auto-card> and <auto-card>Wrenn and Six</auto-card>, there's plenty of interaction in the early game.</p>

<p>The card choices of the two Top 8 players patch specific strategic holes. For context, <auto-card>Blood Moon</auto-card> and <auto-card>Orvar, the All-Form</auto-card> have became more prominent in recent weeks as answers to the ever-more-popular <auto-card>Indomitable Creativity</auto-card> archetype. Yet the lists of the Top 8 players show ways around them:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Justin Rouse's sideboard contains <auto-card>Abundant Growth</auto-card>, which helps beat <auto-card>Blood Moon</auto-card>.</li>
	<li>Wan Tingfeng's decklist contains <auto-card>Serra's Emissary</auto-card>, which is not affected by <auto-card>Orvar, the All-Form</auto-card>. (Orvar can be discarded to <auto-card>Archon of Cruelty</auto-card> to copy it and take over the game, so it's awesome sideboard tech, but it's useless against <auto-card>Serra's Emissary</auto-card>.)</li>
</ul>

<h1>Jeskai Breach</h1>

===decklistId:Jeskai_Breach_Chas_Hinkle_Top_8__95b326c0-bd03-46f1-a683-f8d163da9896===

===decklistId:Jeskai_Breach__Top_32_at_the_Beta_Draft_Qualifier__a42c372f-0aca-46e5-9e19-16fe3f4e815c===

===decklistId:Jeskai_Breach__Top_32_at_the_Beta_Draft_Qualifier__b7914557-e80c-49fe-b543-4a3d91f79151===

===decklistId:Jeskai_Breach__Top_32_at_the_Beta_Draft_Qualifier__5ce77767-6f78-47b1-a355-7ac6be401f7f===

<p>Jeskai Breach is also a top-tier Modern deck, and it can win in various ways. One option is to combo off by repeatedly milling yourself. This involves sacrificing <auto-card>Mishra's Bauble</auto-card> or <auto-card>Mox Amber</auto-card> to <auto-card>Grinding Station</auto-card> and recasting the zero-mana artifact via <auto-card>Underworld Breach</auto-card>. You loop until you win the game with <auto-card>Thassa's Oracle</auto-card>. But if you don't draw the combo, then you can also win a fair game by attacking with <auto-card>Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer</auto-card>; <auto-card>Ledger Shredder</auto-card>; or <auto-card>Urza's Saga</auto-card> tokens.</p>

<p>I unfortunately did not receive the decklist of Michael Lee, one of the two Jeskai Breach players in the Top 8. The other, Chas Hinkle, made the most of his Beta draft experience.</p>

<h1>Rakdos Undying</h1>

===decklistId:Rakdos_Undying__Top_32_at_the_Beta_Draft_Qualifier__978c3793-d76f-4b27-adb9-10f1306b2b00===

===decklistId:Rakdos_Undying__Top_32_at_the_Beta_Draft_Qualifier__b534c4f9-c54b-4dd6-8f82-dbb9f2f5de7b===

===decklistId:Rakdos_Undying__Top_32_at_the_Beta_Draft_Qualifier__b9dfc63d-e627-4d6e-938f-0f60900df7b1===

===decklistId:Rakdos_Undying__Top_32_at_the_Beta_Draft_Qualifier__883f6801-828a-46b2-8316-2b9ae28e1c6b===

<p>The dream with Rakdos Undying is to evoke <auto-card>Grief</auto-card> of <auto-card>Fury</auto-card> on turn one, then cast <auto-card>Feign Death</auto-card> or <auto-card>Undying Malice</auto-card> to return it to the battlefield. In case of <auto-card>Grief</auto-card>, this yields two pain-free <auto-card>Thoughtseize</auto-card>s and a 4/3 menace on turn one. In case of <auto-card>Fury</auto-card>, it produces a 4/4 double striker on turn one. Both can leave opponents feeling like they were scammed out of playing a fair game.</p>

<p>One list has a fascinating combo: <auto-card>Lightning Skelemental</auto-card> plus <auto-card>Village Rites</auto-card>. The 6/1 haster gives the deck a more aggressive bent, and being able to sacrifice it to draw two cards is a sweet deal. Note that there is no synergy with <auto-card>Undying Malice</auto-card> because you also have to sacrifice <auto-card>Lightning Skelemental</auto-card> at the end of the opponent's end step.</p>

<h1>Hammer Time</h1>

===decklistId:Hammer_Time__Top_32_at_the_Beta_Draft_Qualifier__09e814aa-14ad-48af-92e9-600421cdd325===

===decklistId:Hammer_Time__Top_32_at_the_Beta_Draft_Qualifier__2a4fc828-60a5-49e9-ada3-44f9443103e6===

===decklistId:Hammer_Time__Top_32_at_the_Beta_Draft_Qualifier__494abc44-df91-472c-87ce-551f32351016===

<p>Hammer Time put three players in the Top 32, but all fell in the single-elimination rounds. The main goal of the deck is to attach <auto-card>Colossus Hammer</auto-card> for free with <auto-card>Sigarda's Aid</auto-card> or <auto-card>Puresteel Paladin</auto-card>. A turn-two kill is even possible with the right opening hand: <auto-card>Sigarda's Aid</auto-card> and <auto-card>Ornithopter</auto-card> on turn one, followed by double <auto-card>Colossus Hammer</auto-card> on turn two. Kills on turn three or turn four are more realistic and, thanks to <auto-card>Urza's Saga</auto-card> and <auto-card>Stoneforge Mystic</auto-card>, consistent.</p>

<h1>Merfolk</h1>

===decklistId:Merfolk_Jon_Paton_Top_8__84820ad9-b7a0-4195-a0ec-8e15b0890c14===

===decklistId:Merfolk_Jonathon_Zaczek_Top_8__7be5806e-795e-4b59-be85-11eec2ff7a20===

<p>Two Merfolk players made it to the Top 8, marking a breakout performance for the tribe. It has been slowly growing in popularity ever since <i>Dominaria United</i> added <auto-card>Vodalian Hexcatcher</auto-card>, which is particularly powerful against combo decks relying on expensive spells like <auto-card>Indomitable Creativity</auto-card>.</p>

<p>The two decklists have small differences in their creature bases, such as whether to use <auto-card>Harbinger of the Tides</auto-card> or <auto-card>Cursecatcher</auto-card>. Sideboard tweaks like <auto-card>Spreading Seas</auto-card> are also spicy, as they can turn on the islandwalk ability on <auto-card>Lord of Atlantis</auto-card>. If you have to decide between the two decklists, then I would trust the card choices of legendary Merfolk master Jonathon "Nikachu" Zaczek!</p>

<h1>Rhinos</h1>

===decklistId:Rhinos_Miles_Wilson_Top_8__582b10d1-f652-4e7c-a48d-3120b0d657c4===

===decklistId:Rhinos__Top_32_at_the_Beta_Draft_Qualifier__a891b897-2246-43e7-a376-e1132d032e13===

<p>Rhinos doesn't use <auto-card>Yorion, Sky Nomad</auto-card> anymore, and there are now several variants involving either <auto-card>Leyline Binding</auto-card> or <auto-card>Blood Moon</auto-card> in the main deck. But all of them try to cascade into <auto-card>Crashing Footfalls</auto-card> on turn three. I like the spicy <auto-card>Become Immense</auto-card> in one of the lists; it can lead to a lot of damage when pumping targeting trampling Rhinos or a double-striking <auto-card>Fury</auto-card>.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">What a crazy weekend went 9-1 in the modern qualifier with 🦏 rhinos 🦏 .

<h1>Burn</h1>

===decklistId:Burn__Top_32_at_the_Beta_Draft_Qualifier__49781099-7d68-4602-8584-2f71f651e06c===

===decklistId:Burn__Top_32_at_the_Beta_Draft_Qualifier__3ecf9847-caa1-41d6-86ff-330758c676d4===

<p>The one surprise to point out here is two copies of <auto-card>Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer</auto-card> in the main deck of one of the two lists. I recently proposed this change several weeks ago because in my experience, the best draws from Burn are the ones where you stick one or two early creatures as repetitive damage sources. By going from 12 to 14 creatures, you increase the probability of having a creature in your opening hand from 81% to 86%, which is significant. It's nice to see other players find success with this as well.</p>

<h1>Four-Color Omnath</h1>

===decklistId:Four-Color_Omnath_Harrison_Kanfer_Top_8__c651ea0b-e3a8-48f2-8e38-863825235731===

<p>This 60-card list is how Four-Color Omnath can look like with <auto-card>Kaheera, the Orphanguard</auto-card> instead of <auto-card>Yorion, Sky Nomad</auto-card>. The list is controlling in nature and almost seems like an Azorius Control deck splashing for <auto-card>Omnath, Locus of Creation</auto-card>; <auto-card>Expressive Iteration</auto-card>; and <auto-card>Wrenn and Six</auto-card>. Indeed, with <auto-card>Teferi, Hero of Dominaria</auto-card> and <auto-card>Jace, the Mind Sculptor</auto-card> in the flex slots, there is a lot of interaction and card advantage in the late game. This may be the new look of Four-Color Omnath.</p>

<h1>Other Archetypes</h1>

<p>The remaining archetypes are singletons that did not survive the single-elimination rounds yet showcase the diversity of the Modern format.</p>

<p><a href="https://magic.gg/news/return-of-the-pro-tour-your-path-to-playing-magic-at-the-highest-level" target="_blank">The new Path to the Pro Tour is already underway</a> and as players are competing to qualify for the first Pro Tour of 2023—"Pro Tour 1" taking place in Philadelphia, PA, USA—we have more details for you on the qualifying round for the second Pro Tour next year, "Pro Tour 2."</p>

<h1>Upcoming Regional Championship Qualifiers</h1>

<p>The qualifying round for the Regional Championships for Pro Tour 2 starts October 1, 2022, and runs through December 18, 2022. Participating WPN stores as well as larger organizers will be running Regional Championship Qualifiers (RCQs) that provide invitation to the Regional Championship for their respective region. These Regional Championships will take place in the first quarter of 2023 and qualify players for Pro Tour 2 later in 2023.</p>

<p>This round of RCQs includes new promos you can earn competing in these events within your region—and this time, they feature new, never-before-seen art in a borderless treatment:</p>

<p>Eli Kassis. One of the veterans of the field. The longtime pro who has consistently upped his game over the years, his hard work paying off with a title at the Neon Dynasty Championship.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/3B9rCrrmjeKUXpimWtAMf8/97bea2b79627971586d1dbcf3cbe3fd7/1920x1280-MWC-XXVIII-Nathan-Steuer-Trophy.jpg" /><p class="embedImageCaption">Nathan Steuer</p></div></div><br />

<p>Nathan Steuer. The wunderkind and <i>Magic Online</i> endboss who has risen through the ranks of competitive play online over the past three years and put it all together in 2022 with a string of event victories, a World Championship qualification and now a finals run.</p>

<p>Two friends and competitors, now facing off where only one would earn the title of <i>Magic</i> World Champion.</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><embed-iframe fallback-img="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/1TzbKdTr0eC7lEIZh8S2hP/21f407e22dca180089c98aa97de01080/1920x1080_Blue_Background_Full.png" has-consent="true"   src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=ThirstyFancyChowderTooSpicy-6YZTnUFd2eXogmqH&autoplay=false" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" height="561" width="920"></embed-iframe></p>

<p>As the finals opened, Kassis led with a pair of the flexible <auto-card>Wedding Announcement</auto-card>, while a pair of <auto-card>Make Disappear</auto-card> provided Steuer with a reactive opening hand. Instead, Steuer found <auto-card>Fable of the Mirror-Breaker</auto-card>, which he opted to deploy over leaving up interaction.</p>

<p>Fable proved one of the strongest cards in a wide variety of formats, and Steuer followed his first with a second copy. It led to a flow of Treasures, powering the second <auto-card>Make Disappear</auto-card> on Kassis' turn.</p>

</magic-cards>

<p>Ahead on both card selection and mana, Steuer found himself in commanding position to deploy what might be his best card against the Esper MIdrange decks: <auto-card>Invoke Despair</auto-card>, and it was aptly named. A bunch of sacrifices later, Kassis fell to the clean-up <auto-card>Liliana of the Veil</auto-card> that destroyed his hand.</p>

<p>It was a lightning-fast first game that turned on a dime; the second clash in the match was the complete opposite. Neither player cast a spell until the fourth turn, when <auto-card>Bloodtithe Harvester</auto-card> on Steuer's side opened the floodgates.</p>

<p>From there, an <auto-card>Anointed Peacekeeper</auto-card> for Kassis (naming the <auto-card>Infernal Grasp</auto-card> that did indeed reside in Steuer's hand) gave him the lead in tempo, and a follow-up Kaito Shizuke put him ahead on cards as well. On the defensive, Steuer tried to block with a <auto-card>Bloodtithe Harvester</auto-card>, only for it to fall to a channeled <auto-card>Eiganjo, Seat of the Empire</auto-card>. That exchange cleared the path for Kassis to resolve <auto-card>The Wandering Emperor</auto-card>, and a follow-up <auto-card>Raffine, Scheming Seer</auto-card> a turn later was more than though to beat Steur's land-heavy hand and send the pair into a third game.</p>

<magic-cards>
  548337
  555414
  548538
</magic-cards>

<p>The decider (of the first match of the best-of-three) saw competing three-drops resolved, as Steuer had <auto-card>Fable of the Mirror-Breaker</auto-card> against Kassis' <auto-card>Kaito Shizuki</auto-card>. Both players had found their engines and the match hinged on who could best leverage it, though it certainly took some time to sort out. The reflection of Kiki-Jiki gave Steuer a steady stream of <auto-card>Corpse Appraiser</auto-card>s while Kassis leaned on Kaito and Raffine for his cards.</p>

<p>The result? As it has often in this format, Raffine's schemes proved superior to all other forms of card advantage, and a massive attack with four creatures allowed Kassis to pump an unblockable token to epic proportions to take down the first match of the World Championship final.</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><embed-iframe fallback-img="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/1TzbKdTr0eC7lEIZh8S2hP/21f407e22dca180089c98aa97de01080/1920x1080_Blue_Background_Full.png" has-consent="true"   src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=SavoryCheerfulCoyoteTakeNRG-gY6zXAnHIRgMon2v&autoplay=false" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" height="561" width="920"></embed-iframe></p>

<p>The opening game of the second match played out differently than the first. Neither player was able to get out to a huge early advantage, but both set up value engines with <auto-card>Reckoner Bankbuster</auto-card> for Steuer and <auto-card>The Wandering Emperor</auto-card> for Kassis. When Steuer attempted to fight back with a planeswalker of his own, <auto-card>Liliana of the Veil</auto-card> ran headlong into <auto-card>Ertai Resurrected</auto-card>. It was a game-defining play for Kassis, who followed up with <auto-card>Ao, the Dawn Sky</auto-card>.</p>

<p>Ao fell from the sky thanks to <auto-card>Infernal Grasp</auto-card>, but even more concerning for Kassis was completely whiffing on its trigger and finding nothing to put into play. That forced a chump-block to save his Emperor from Bankbuster, and Kassis was forced to pass the turn back ahead on board but with his shields down. Would Steuer capitalize on the moment?</p>

<p>He could, and did. He played a seventh land and lined things up perfectly for both a Sheoldred of his own as well as a Fable. That eliminated the advantage Kassis had hoped to gain, and when another <auto-card>Invoke Despair</auto-card> followed Steuer had again taken the first game of the match.</p>

<p>This time it was the second game of the match that went fast. Steuer landed an early <auto-card>Reckoner Bankbuster</auto-card>, but when it fell to a removal spell and he had no answer for the Sheoldred that followed, he scooped his cards up quickly to move to game three.</p>

<p>That meant that Kassis was now just one game away from winning the World Championship title. But a slow start with match point on the line meant he couldn't deploy <auto-card>Negate</auto-card> to head off <auto-card>Fable of the Mirror-Breaker</auto-card>. When Steuer transformed it into its creature side and began to accumulate value, Kassis looked for a way back into the game. <auto-card>Sanctuary Warden</auto-card> was a start, but it wasn't enough. Steuer found interaction on the top of his deck and finally broke his losing streak against Kassis evening up the title match with one match apiece.</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><embed-iframe fallback-img="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/1TzbKdTr0eC7lEIZh8S2hP/21f407e22dca180089c98aa97de01080/1920x1080_Blue_Background_Full.png" has-consent="true"   src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=BlightedWealthyOxLitty-MgPMLWjYRTur-_Qb&autoplay=false" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" height="561" width="920"></embed-iframe></p>

<p>This was it. One final match with the title on the line. A World Champion was about to be crowned.</p>

<p>But to start, Kassis would have to do it short on lands. He failed to find a fourth as Steuer systematically rstopped his early plays via countermagic, removal, and then <auto-card>Liliana of the Veil</auto-card>. That put Kassis heavily on the back foot and at just 10 life while Steuer built a battlefield with <auto-card>Corpse Appraiser</auto-card> and more. Sheoldred from Steuer was the final blow.</p>

<p>This time Game 2 belonged to Kassis. Steuer couldn't find blue mana, and the duo were quickly on to the final game, with absolutely everything attached to it.</p>

<p>A second turn <auto-card>Reckoner Bankbuster</auto-card> from Steuer forced the action from Kassis, but that left the door open for Steuer to deploy the topdecked <auto-card>Fable of the Mirror-Breaker</auto-card> to the board. And when Steuer untapped with Fable, he devised a gameplan around protecting a reflection of Kiki-Jiki. That meant holding up countermagic as Kassis struggled to make land drops, and several turns later the Reflection was ready to begin copying creatures–protected by a pair of counterspells.</p>

<p>That fourth land Kassis needed never came. But the <auto-card>Corpse Appraiser</auto-card> from Steuer did, and a it was all over. Nathan Steuer had battled back from dropping three matches in the row to Kassis, claiming the final victory screen of the weekend.</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><embed-iframe fallback-img="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/1TzbKdTr0eC7lEIZh8S2hP/21f407e22dca180089c98aa97de01080/1920x1080_Blue_Background_Full.png" has-consent="true"   src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=AdventurousHappyFalconTheRinger-aozff1Bmx2q1xpmb&autoplay=false" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" height="561" width="920"></embed-iframe></p>

<p><a href="https://magic.gg/events/magic-world-championship-xxviii" target="_blank"><i>Magic </i>World Championship XXVIII</a> kicked off on Friday with 32 competitors who spent the past year working toward this moment. We were treated to two days of incredible competition through three formats that all brought their own challenges, not to mention the nerves that only an event like a World Championship can bring.</p>

<p>Now here we are, with the final four from the fracas battling it out in a double-elimination bracket for the title of World Champion.</p>

<p>Here's how the Top 4 played out.</p>

<h1>The Upper Bracket</h1>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/xGdRqXfNJWGi4ZazNSMF2/2d908d7435f315c5462d4d2761350498/Magic-World-Championship-XXVIII-Top-4-Player-Bracket-00.jpg" /></div></div><br />

<p>Round 14 of <i>Magic </i>World Championship XXVIII came packed with as much drama as possible, as many final rounds do. In this case, and no players secured the 11 wins nededto guarantee themselves a Top 4 spot, things stood more open than usual. That brought on the biggest match of young Nathan Steuer's life: a clean win-and-in against Eli Kassis, who stood atop the crowded standings.</p>

<p>The result was a heartbreaking match for Steuer, who came up just short. But when the dust settled and the tiebreakers were sorted out, it was Steuer who occupied the fourth and final spot on the Sunday stage, following Kassis after he secured the top slot. That meant that the first match of the Top 4 bracket would be a rematch of Round 14, and an opportunity for Steuer to avenge his Historic loss with a trip back to Standard.</p>

<p>After the players split the first two games, it all came down to a third to decide the match. And as players traded resources back and forth it looked like the Grixis Midrange deck piloted by Steuer would do what it was designed to do: grind out the Esper Midrange deck that was piloted by 69% of the field and the three other members of the Top 4.</p>

<p>But <auto-card>Sanctuary Warden</auto-card> changed all that. Kassis landed the bomb Angel and used it to stave off defeat long enough for Sheolded, the Apocalypse to arrive. Another incredibly close match between the pair, and another going to Kassis.</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><embed-iframe fallback-img="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/1TzbKdTr0eC7lEIZh8S2hP/21f407e22dca180089c98aa97de01080/1920x1080_Blue_Background_Full.png" has-consent="true"   src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=SpicyBusyPlumageUWot--MIyWEEvCXKyLc-q&autoplay=false" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" height="561" width="920"></embed-iframe></p>

<p>The other match of the semifinals featured Sarap and Tóth battling in an Esper Midrange mirror. Or, more accurately, the <auto-card>Wedding Announcement</auto-card> mirror. Both players flooded the board with tokens and the grindy games were everything the midrange mirror promised to be. Combat became increasingly tricky and each player looked for a way to go over the top.</p>

<p>After a narrow victory in the opener, Tóth found a way to go over the top in the next game, though perhaps not in the way he expected; Sarap got stuck on three lands and a much healthier mix of mana allowed Tóth to slowly pull ahead on board until his army of tokens grew too large for Sarap to match.</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><embed-iframe fallback-img="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/1TzbKdTr0eC7lEIZh8S2hP/21f407e22dca180089c98aa97de01080/1920x1080_Blue_Background_Full.png" has-consent="true"   src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=BlindingGeniusPangolinHassaanChop-VnjINI6nK0GD2gEg&autoplay=false" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" height="561" width="920"></embed-iframe></p>

<p>Next up was the Upper Finals. The winner between Kassis and Tóth would move on to the best-two-of-three-matches Title Match while the loser would await either Steuer or Sarap from the Lower Semifinals.</p>

<p>The two teammates had met twice previously in the tournament, splitting the matches with Tóth coming out on top in Standard. But in the rematch it was all Kassis all the way, as he leveraged a stream of high-level threats against an off-balance Tóth forced into a reactive role.</p>

<p>The second game played out similarly, with Sheolded doing the heavy lifting to prop up Kassis while <auto-card>Raffine, Scheming Seer</auto-card> did what it has done all weekend: sculpt the perfect hand while growing a board presence. The curve out allowed Kassis to take the driver's seat in the deciding game, until <auto-card>Ludevic, Necrogenius</auto-card> arrived to seal the deal.</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><embed-iframe fallback-img="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/1TzbKdTr0eC7lEIZh8S2hP/21f407e22dca180089c98aa97de01080/1920x1080_Blue_Background_Full.png" has-consent="true"   src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=ExpensiveAmazingAlbatrossKAPOW-_K41C-J7MH4Pxq40&autoplay=false" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" height="561" width="920"></embed-iframe></p>

<p>With that, the first Title Match participant was in. Kassis, who has been a longtime Pro Tour player with eight Grand Prix Top 8s and two wins to his name, has truly broken through over the past several seasons with two Top Finishes including a victory at the Neon Dynasty Championship. Now he found himself to add the one trophy he's missing: the world title.</p>

<h1>The Lower Bracket</h1>

<p>With that, all that remained was to determine who would meet Kassis in the World Championship Title Match.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/7vJgx9jui5MQILT34SjT4o/e1a79e76b350b6441740744176e7f5f0/Magic-World-Championship-XXVIII-Top-4-Player-Bracket-04.jpg" /></div></div><br />

<p>It began with Steuer and Sarap, where an unfortunate day for Sarap continued as he failed to keep up with Steur's value engines in the first game, then fell apart in the second as he couldn't find an answer to <auto-card>Fable of the Mirror-Breaker</auto-card>.</p>

<p>The powerful enchantment was the reason Steuer chose to play a Grixis deck over Esper, and it paid off with a quick 2-0 victory that sent Steuer to the lower final against Tóth.</p>

<p>In the Title Match, Kassis awaited the winner. It would be his teammate Tóth, or a prodigious competitor who took the online world by storm?</p>

<p>Steuer wanted another shot at Kassis, and thanks to <auto-card>Invoke Despair</auto-card> that's exactly what he would get. Steuer's contorted manabase supported the difficult-to-cast sorcery, but doing sopaid off the Lower Finals as he was able to cast the game-winning bomb after both players had whittled each other out of resources.</p>

<p>A long and complex first game had gone Steuer's way, and the next game proved it was his day: Tóth never found a third land, and a few turns later Steuer won his way into the Title Match and one more rematch against Kassis.</p>

Competitors were back to battle for their place in the Top 4 through six rounds of Explorer, the third format for the weekend and one left wide open by the small field. With nerves, matchups, and math to manage, the Saturday sprint to elimination rounds provided all the drama that only a World Championship can provide, and it didn't disappoint.</p>

<p>We also thought we knew what the road to the Top 4 might look like. A pair of the youngest players in the tournament in Julian Wellman and Nathan Steuer had outpaced the field on Friday, and early in Day Two it looked like they might cruise into Sunday. But as the early rounds faded into the afternoon, so too did the leaders of the field. As we entered the final rounds of Explorer, everything was still on the table and no one had locked the 11 wins for a Top 4 berth.</p>

<p>The scrum of players battling it out for win-and-ins was a joy to watch. When the dust settled, one leader had managed to squeak into the Top 4 of <i>Magic</i> World Championship XXVIII.</p>

<h1>From Explorer to the Top 4</h1>

<p>The unique challenge presented by the World Championship was that players must have a mastery of <i>three</i> separate formats to do well: <i>Dominaria United</i> Draft, Standard, and Explorer, a more recent addition to formats on <i>MTG Arena</i> (that's every Pioneer legal card there).<i>.</i> And no matter how well players did in Draft and Standard on Day One, it would all be for naught if they couldn't bring see it through with performance in Explorer.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/58jNU9TS1zOBeqb6eMlwUr/1340f6d4b77b166abb627f2e30cc1b29/WC-XXVIII-Metagame-Explorer.jpg" /></div></div><br />

<p>A diverse field offered up incredible games all day, including what was almost certainly of the match of the day in Round 11, as Jakub Tóth and his team's well-positioned Mono-Blue Spirits deck tore through a field of powerful-but-sometimes-clunky decks like <auto-card>Greasefang, Okiba Boss</auto-card> and <auto-card>Transmogrify</auto-card>-into-<auto-card>Titan of Industry</auto-card> (or <auto-card>Hornet Queen</auto-card>) combos.</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><embed-iframe fallback-img="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/1TzbKdTr0eC7lEIZh8S2hP/21f407e22dca180089c98aa97de01080/1920x1080_Blue_Background_Full.png" has-consent="true"   src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=PoliteUglyHerringStrawBeary-Z9RxTV5mY-9dVHFJ&autoplay=false" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" height="561" width="920"></embed-iframe></p>

<p>Backed up by creatures that could poke in early damage (and be boosted by <auto-card>Supreme Phantom</auto-card>), the Spirits deck backed up its aggressive starts with <auto-card>Curious Obsession</auto-card> and a host of countermagic to keep the other decks off balance. Between <auto-card>Rattlechains</auto-card>, <auto-card>Mausoleum Wanderer</auto-card> and the countermagic the mono-blue deck could play at instant speed and choose between deploying creatures or interacting with the stack. They even put <auto-card>Leyline of Combustion</auto-card> in the sideboard, unable to cast it in the main deck at all, for the anticipated <auto-card>Witch's Oven</auto-card> and <auto-card>Cauldron Familiar</auto-card> sacrifice decks.</p>

<p>It was a brilliant, effective plan that propelled its five pilots to strong finishes.</p>

<p>"We really liked the deck. Greasefang was our best matchup," explained Kassis, who finished as the only undefeated 6-0 Explorer player. "During our testing we played five matches between the two decks, and then switched sides for five more; Spirits won them all. That helped us feel more comfortable with it."</p>

<p>It was clear that the field was ready for Abzan Greasefang. In addition to Kassis, Jakub Tóth also punched his Top 4 ticket with a "spirited" run on Saturday, his final victory coming over Jim Davis in an incredibly intricate Spirits mirror in Round 14. <auto-card>Supreme Phantom</auto-card> is great; all four of them is <i>even better</i> and in an absolute heartbreaker for Davis he ended up one creature short.</p>

<p>Tóth's incredible run had at least one fan ready for more to come.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If Jakub has million number of fans i am one of them 🙋🏻. if Jakub has ten fans i am one of them. if Jakub have only one fan and that is me 🙋🏼🙋🏽🙋🏾. if Jakub has no fans, that means i am no more on the earth 😢. if world against Jakub, i am against the world <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MTGWorlds?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MTGWorlds</a></p>&mdash; Ondřej Stráský (@OndrejStrasky) <a href="https://twitter.com/OndrejStrasky/status/1586519856576241665?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 30, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The next player to lock up their spot was Sarap. One of the best underdog stories this year, his win-and-in for Worlds would come against none other than the defending World Championship himself: Yuta Takahashi. The Japanese titan put together a strong second-half run of his own to move into Top 4 contention, and found himself on the verge of the back-to-back opportunity, but Sarap and his army of "Temur Rhinos" (<auto-card>Transmogrify</auto-card> into <auto-card>Titan of Industry</auto-card>, then choose to make a 4/4 Rhino token) knocked off the previously undefeated-on-Day Two Takahashi to secure the second Top Finish of his career and the biggest finish for him to date.</p>

<p>That left one spot to fill, and as the field flattened throughout the day it was a tossup where things would land. And with Kassis having already locked his spot, Steuer had a clean win-and-in. But he fell to a turn-zero <auto-card>Leyline of Combustion</auto-card> in the final round, leaving him to sweat tiebreakers as all waited for the final spot to fill.</p>

<p>And in the span of just a few minutes, the wunderkind who dominated online play this year went from the depths of defeat to the heights of making the final rounds of a World Championship.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">IM IN THE TOP 4 OF WORLDS HOLY CRAP <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MTGWorlds?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MTGWorlds</a> 😭 <br>After such a roller coaster of emotions the last 3 matches went my way from other results and I made it on tie breakers.

<p>With that, the Top 4 of <i>Magic</i> World Championship XXVIII was set!</p>

<h1>Looking Ahead</h1>

<p>If the first two days of the World Championship were all about fighting through a myriad of unique challenges across multiple formats, the final day is all about mastery of Standard. With three Esper Midrange decks and Steuer's Grixis Midrange flavor, the games are sure to feature lots of critical decisions and plenty of <auto-card>Raffine, Scheming Seer</auto-card>s.</p>

<p>Steuer will have a chance against Kassis to avenge his Round 14 loss: they'll meet in the first round tomorrow in a Grixis-Esper matchup. Meanwhile, Tóth and Sarap will battle in the Esper mirror. It's a double-elimination format, affording all four players ample opportunity to advance to the best-of-three-matches Title Match.</p>

<p>Sarap may be the best Limited player in the <i>Magic</i> World Championship XXVIII field, though he still refers to himself as a "future professional <i>Magic</i> player." Originally from Europe but living in Columbia, Sarap has found his success largely through digital <i>Magic,</i> rising to the top of the <i>Magic Online</i> leaderboards. He qualified for <i>Magic</i> World Championship XXVIII with a memorable run through the New Capenna Championship working with David Inglis and an invite-clinching victory over fellow qualifier Zachary Kiihne in the Top 8.</p>

The culmination of a season of play, a series of set championships, a monthslong points race and a final, furious flurry of testing, <a href="https://magic.gg/events/magic-world-championship-xxviii" target="_blank"><i>Magic</i> World Championship XXVIII</a> is the pinnacle of competitive play and the biggest tournament of these players' lives. Ensconced in the spectacle that is <i>Magic</i> 30, everything came down to this.</p>

<p>And in one of the biggest moments in their lives, Julian Wellman and Nathan Steuer came up clutch. Two of the field's youngest players showed they're ready to take on the World Championship, and both finished the day 7-1 after meeting as the final two undefeated players late. Along the way we journeyed through <i>Dominaria United</i> draft and five Standard rounds featuring a field full of Esper and several players who came prepared to take advantage of that fact. Here's how we got there.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/4jYrvjGoNB7qYfCLwG00E1/1562eb8e6641728f45aeffca22b9d2f9/1920x1080-MWC-XXVIII-EOD1-Wellman-and-Steuer-Lead-the-Way.jpg" /><p class="embedImageCaption">Team Handshake teammates Nathan Steuer and Julian Wellman stand atop the field at 7-1.</p></div></div><br />

<h1>Deft Dominaria United Drafters</h1>

<p>It's rare for a draft format to divide opinions weeks after its release, but <i>Dominaria United</i> is the rare set to do that. With dozens of multicolor cards, kicker cards, and a bevy of mana fixing lands, the format has proven to be a classic.</p>

<p>Perfect for a World Championship showdown.</p>

<p>This weekend brought Limited back to the highest levels of competitive play, to the delight of many in the field. For longtime players such as Reid Duke, Mike Sigrist, and Shota Yasooka, it was a welcome return to a staple of the Pro Tour. But for some of the newer players who qualified for this event largely via online Constructed play, Draft was both a major point of emphasis and the source of their biggest concerns.</p>

<p>Any doubts were laid to rest quickly though. The largest testing team in the field, <a href="https://magic.gg/news/joining-forces-for-magic-world-championship-xxviii" target="_blank">and by far the most successful team of the past season</a>, dominated the <i>Dominaria United</i> draft at a level reserved for some of the most masterful team performances in Pro Tour memory.</p>

<p>More than enough to impress at least one former World Champion.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Apparently Team Handshake had a 17-4 record in draft (excluding teamkills) for an 81% winrate!

<p>"We had a testing team of nine people, so we were able to get complete draft pods to practice in and I think that really helped us," explained Wylde-LaRue, who finished Friday 5-3.</p>

<p>"I knew lots of people liked the base-green domain decks and would pick the lands highly. I liked drafting Jeskai the most, but other people weren't as high on it. I ended up first-picking <auto-card>Shivan Devastator</auto-card> and then moved into white in the middle of pack one. I also picked up <auto-card>Weatherlight Compleated</auto-card>, which is a card I had never played before. Some people I showed my deck thought a Grizzly Bear would be better. But after playing three rounds with it, it was definitely way better than that!"</p>

<h1>The Kids Are All Right (On Top of the Standings)</h1>

<p>The biggest takeaway from Day One of <i>Magic</i> World Championship XXVIII was clear: the torch has been passed in competitive <i>Magic.</i></p>

<p>As the players converged on Las Vegas, we all wondered whether the latest generation of online-first players could manage the pressure of the moment against seasoned vets like Reid Duke and Logan Nettles (both of whom also got their start on <i>Magic Online</i> many years ago), as the World Championship brought together competitors who all qualified in a myriad of unique ways. And after one day of competition and a leaderboard filled with competitors who got their competitive start on <i>MTG Arena</i> over the last few years, that question has been answered.</p>

<p>The Hall of Famers are still here. But resumes don't win matches: players do. Eight rounds of Day One play showcased that everyone at the World Championship was capable of staring down even the best to ever play the game without blinking.</p>

<p>Wellman and Steuer led the way. Two of the most successful online players this year, with Steuer the endboss of <i>Magic Online</i> Champions Showcase events and Wellman spearheading incredible success at Championships across the season, met in Round 5 of <i>Magic</i> World Championship XXVIII still undefeated.</p>

<p>It was Wellman who emerged unscathed from the battle, and he would cruise into Day Two from there adjusting to the bright lights and stage of the World Championship.</p>

<p>As the dust settled on the Standard rounds, the other takeaway was that the 68% Esper Midrange field may have actually been more open than expected.</p>

<p>Wellman blazed a path with Izzet Tempo as Jean-Emmanuel Depraz chased right before with Mono-Blue Tempo deck, the pair cut their way through a field of <auto-card>The Wandering Emperor</auto-card> and <auto-card>Raffine, Scheming Seer</auto-card>.</p>

<h1>Looking Ahead</h1>

<p>Players shift gears Saturday morning as they return for Day Two and six rounds of the exciting Explorer format. It's a challenging triple format event (along with Draft and Standard) that tests the mettle of the players by putting a spotlight on whether any team was able to gain a true advantage against the field. You can <a href="https://magic.gg/decklists/magic-world-championship-xxviii-explorer-decklists" target="_blank">find all the Explorer decklists online now</a>, with <a href="https://magic.gg/news/the-7-spiciest-explorer-decks-at-magic-world-championship-xxviii" target="_blank">the seven spiciest of them as highlighted by Hall of Famer Frank Karsten</a>.</p>

<p>As Steuer and Wellman lead the way, we'll watch six rounds of Explorer setting a Top 4 returning Sunday. The stakes to win it all are clear: $100,000 first-place prize, the glory of being featured on a future <i>Magic</i> card, and the title of World Champion. We’ll see the next step begin at 9 a.m. PT tomorrow, live at <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/magic" target="_blank">twitch.tv/magic</a>.</p>

Yet others were quite surprising—either because they use innovative combinations of cards or because they were not a major part of the recent competitive metagame previously.</p>

<p>Explorer is comprised of all <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/formats/pioneer" target="_blank">Pioneer</a>-legal cards on <i>MTG Arena</i>, and it's the format for the six World Championship rounds on Saturday October 29. In this article, I'll take a closer look at the seven spiciest Explorer decks submitted for the event.</p>

===decklistId:Mono-Red_Fires_Simon_Görtzen_Magic_World_Championship_XXVIII_10_28_2022_c617de59-7746-46df-834e-ad052544300e===

<p>Pro Tour champion and longtime commentator Simon Görtzen, who qualified for the World Championship by finishing in the Top 6 at the Innistrad Championship, brought a spicy brew with powerful synergies. Imagine the following start:</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>Turn 2:</b> <auto-card>Cleansing Wildfire</auto-card> your own <auto-card>Darksteel Citadel</auto-card> or <auto-card>Cascading Cataracts</auto-card>. As the lands are indestructible, <auto-card>Cleansing Wildfire</auto-card> effectively becomes a red <auto-card>Rampant Growth</auto-card> that draws a card.</li>
	<li><b>Turn 3:</b> <auto-card>Fires of Invention</auto-card>, then <auto-card>Anger of the Gods</auto-card> to sweep the board.</li>
	<li><b>Turn 4:</b> Using <auto-card>Fires of Invention</auto-card>, cast <auto-card>Terror of the Peaks</auto-card> and <auto-card>Cavalier of Flame</auto-card>s. Ping your opponent for six damage, activate <auto-card>Cavalier of Flame</auto-card>s twice, and attack for lethal.</li>
</ul>

<p>The deck also features <auto-card>Karn, the Great Creator</auto-card>. The planeswalker shuts down any opposing <auto-card>Parhelion II</auto-card> or <auto-card>Witch's Oven</auto-card> activations, and Karn's -2 ability can grab a variety of interactive or game-winning artifacts from the sideboard. For example, <auto-card>Weathered Runestone</auto-card> stops <auto-card>Transmogrify</auto-card>, while <auto-card>Skysovereign, Consul Flagship</auto-card> will crush opposing midrange players. <auto-card>Golos, Tireless Pilgrim</auto-card> is also a sweet one. Even though this is a mono-color deck, Golos can be activated via <auto-card>Cascading Cataracts</auto-card>.</p>

<p>Although I had seen similar-looking <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/mtgo-standings/pioneer-challenge-2022-09-26#runeskjold_th_place" target="_blank">Mono-Red Ramp</a> decks before in the similar Pioneer format, Görtzen's embrace of <auto-card>Fires of Invention</auto-card> led to a more streamlined Explorer build. His sideboard is cleverly put together as well. <auto-card>Robber of the Rich</auto-card> could double as a proactive threat against Azorius Control and as a reach blocker against Mono-Blue Spirits, which is exactly the type of wide flexibility you need when most of your sideboard slots are already claimed by Karn.</p>

===decklistId:Orzhov_Midrange_Drew_Baker_Magic_World_Championship_XXVIII_10_28_2022_2db4f64c-5f59-4eef-870d-973657f41691===

<p>Drew Baker, who qualified for the World Championship via the Challenger leaderboard, also brought a Karn deck. He and Görtzen are the only players to bring the planeswalker, and this may prove to be a good metagame choice. Abzan Greasefang is the most-played Explorer deck at the World Championship, and preventing <auto-card>Parhelion II</auto-card> activations stops their primary game plan. That said, Baker's deck is widely different from Görtzen's.</p>

<p>Baker's list is more of a midrange deck with cheap interaction and a lot of grinding potential. Nearly every creature has an enters-the-battlefield ability, and the only creature that doesn't—<auto-card>Serra Paragon</auto-card>—can recast dead ones from the graveyard. Indeed, thanks to <auto-card>Serra Paragon</auto-card>, <auto-card>Extraction Specialist</auto-card>, <auto-card>Phyrexian Missionary</auto-card>, and <auto-card>Elspeth Conquers Death</auto-card>, creatures won't stay dead for long. This means you won't run out of resources and you can overload the removal spells from opposing midrange decks.</p>

<p>The various enters-the-battlefield abilities can also be reused via <auto-card>Charming Prince</auto-card> from the main deck and <auto-card>Yorion, Sky Nomad</auto-card> from the companion zone. These two can even set up a once-per-turn loop where <auto-card>Charming Prince</auto-card> blinks Yorion, then Yorion blinks <auto-card>Charming Prince</auto-card>. Along with various other creatures for value, of course.</p>

<p>Although similar-looking <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/mtgo-standings/pioneer-super-qualifier-2022-10-03#xwhale_th_place" target="_blank">Boros Mirange</a> or <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/mtgo-standings/pioneer-preliminary-2022-09-29#harry_-" target="_blank">Azorius Mirange</a> decks lists have seen fringe play in Pioneer recently, Baker's card choices in Explorer and his preference for Orzhov are relatively novel. I like his inclusion of <auto-card>Sungold Sentinel</auto-card> to prevent graveyard shenanigans from Abzan Greasefang, and the black splash looks worthwhile. In particular, <auto-card>Fatal Push</auto-card> synergizes nicely with <auto-card>Charming Prince</auto-card> or Yorion. After all, to enable revolt, no deaths are necessary—leaving the battlefield temporarily suffices.</p>

===decklistId:Temur_Transmogrify_Simon_Nielsen_Magic_World_Championship_XXVIII_10_28_2022_a1c2492a-3049-431c-9e8d-96d8741b69c2===

<p>The team of Simon Nielsen, Matti Kuisma, Karl Sarap, and Julian Wellman all brought Temur <auto-card>Transmogrify</auto-card>, an under-the-radar archetype. Their lists are nearly identical, with only minor disagreements regarding the exact numbers of <auto-card>Courier's Briefcase</auto-card>, <auto-card>Make Disappear</auto-card>, <auto-card>Voltage Surge</auto-card>, and <auto-card>Abrade</auto-card> in the main deck. Players with an additional <auto-card>Abrade</auto-card> in the main deck then got room for an additional <auto-card>Soul-Guide Lantern</auto-card> in the sideboard. But in essence, it's all the same deck.</p>

<p>The game plan can be described via a simple five-step process:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Create a creature token via <auto-card>Careful Cultivation</auto-card>, <auto-card>Fable of the Mirror-Breaker</auto-card>, <auto-card>Shark Typhoon</auto-card>, or <auto-card>Esika's Chariot</auto-card>. Stealing a creature with <auto-card>The Akroan War</auto-card> also works.</li>
	<li>Target this creature with <auto-card>Transmogrify</auto-card> or <auto-card>Lukka, Coppercoat Outcast</auto-card>'s -2 ability.</li>
	<li>Since the only creature card in this deck is <auto-card>Titan of Industry</auto-card>, you're guaranteed to put one onto the battlefield.</li>
	<li>If your opponent hasn't succumbed to the first 7/7 Elemental, then just make more! For the best results, copy your Titan with <auto-card>Reflection of Kiki-Jiki</auto-card> or blink it with your companion <auto-card>Yorion, Sky Nomad</auto-card>.</li>
	<li>Profit!</li>
</ol>
<br />

<p>Theoretically, step 3 could go wrong if you drew all three copies of <auto-card>Titan of Industry</auto-card>, but that happens only about 0.2% of the time by turn four. Even then, <auto-card>Fire Prophecy</auto-card> allows you to put one on the bottom. <auto-card>Fire Prophecy</auto-card> also helps buy time to draw your key combo pieces, and other interactive spells like <auto-card>Spell Pierce</auto-card> fill a similar role.</p>

<p>The sideboard has some spice as well. For example, if <auto-card>Titan of Industry</auto-card> won't always cut it—say against Mono-Blue Spirits with <auto-card>Shacklegeist</auto-card>—then <auto-card>Hornet Queen</auto-card> can come in to save the day. <auto-card>Lazotep Plating</auto-card> is also a great find, as it serves the triple role of protecting you from <auto-card>Thoughtseize</auto-card>, guarding your <auto-card>Titan of Industry</auto-card> from removal, and putting a token onto the battlefield for <auto-card>Transmogrify</auto-card>.</p>

<p><auto-card>Transmogrify</auto-card> decks are not a complete novelty, and I remember playing against them quite a bit when the Explorer format was brand new. However, they haven't been a big part of the competitive metagame in recent months, and this specific Yorion-infused Temur build is unique. I'm sure that most World Championship competitors were not expecting a large team to show up with it.</p>

===decklistId:Hisamichi_Yoshigoe_Jund_Creativity_Magic_World_Championship_XXVIII_10_28_2022_a544f1ec-5b10-4902-81d9-880d47b1d918===

<p>Hisamichi Yoshigoe, who qualified for the World Championship by finishing in the Top 6 at the New Capenna Championship, also plans for a turn-four <auto-card>Titan of Industry</auto-card>, yet his weapon of choice is <auto-card>Indomitable Creativity</auto-card>.</p>

<p>Compared to <auto-card>Transmogrify</auto-card>, the downside to using <auto-card>Indomitable Creativity</auto-card> is that it's more demanding on the mana base. In addition, you can't include <auto-card>Esika's Chariot</auto-card> in your deck because that would get in the way of a certain <auto-card>Titan of Industry</auto-card> hit.</p>

<p>The upside is that you can cast it for values of X larger than 1, thereby putting multiple Titans onto the battlefield in one go. To enable this, you need cards that create multiple tokens. <auto-card>Fable of the Mirror-Breaker</auto-card>; <auto-card>Big Score</auto-card>; and <auto-card>Sokenzan, Crucible of Defiance</auto-card> are perfect for that purpose.</p>

<p>Yoshigoe's deck splashes black for <auto-card>Thoughtseize</auto-card> and a large number of spot removal spells, so it can play similar to a midrange deck with a combo finish. After buying time with these black spells, a turn-five <auto-card>Titan of Industry</auto-card> will often be good enough. Apart from <auto-card>Indomitable Creativity</auto-card>, Yoshigoe can also accomplish this by ramping to seven mana with <auto-card>Chandra, Torch of Defiance</auto-card> or by reanimating a discarded Titan with <auto-card>Diregraf Rebirth</auto-card>.</p>

<p>While <auto-card>Indomitable Creativity</auto-card> decks sometimes do well in Pioneer tournaments, they usually come in the form of an <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/mtgo-standings/pioneer-showcase-challenge-2022-09-19#bmadman_nd_place" target="_blank">Izzet Creativity</a> deck featuring either <auto-card>Worldspine Wurm</auto-card> and <auto-card>Xenagos, God of Revels</auto-card> (neither of which is available in Explorer) or <auto-card>Torrential Gearhulk</auto-card>. By comparison, Yoshigoe's build is innovative.</p>

===decklistId:Enigmatic_Incarnation_Yimin_Zhi_Magic_World_Championship_XXVIII_10_28_2022_30cb36ed-d7f7-45e9-aa5c-166e6595c064===

<p>Yimin Zhi, who qualified for the World Championship via his Top 6 at the New Capenna Championship, brought an <auto-card>Enigmatic Incarnation</auto-card> deck that looks excellent against Rakdos Midrange and decent against the field as a whole. The dream with this deck is to cast <auto-card>Leyline Binding</auto-card> on turn two or turn three, follow up with <auto-card>Enigmatic Incarnation</auto-card> on turn four, and fetch <auto-card>Titan of Industry</auto-card> at the end of that turn.</p>

<p>Zhi's build innovates on the more commonly seen builds in four ways:</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>Only four colors:</b> Whereas stock builds would use <auto-card>Trial of Ambition</auto-card> as cheap interaction along with a handful of black creatures, the mana requirements to run all five colors were enormous. Zhi cut all the black spells from the main deck and instead uses <auto-card>Omen of the Forge</auto-card> as his two-mana interactive enchantment.</li>
	<li><b>Additional ramp</b>: Zhi uses <auto-card>Wolfwillow Haven</auto-card> and <auto-card>Jukai Naturalist</auto-card> to cast key enchantments, such as <auto-card>Fires of Invention</auto-card> and Engimatic Incarnation, as early as turn three. Both two-mana ramp cards are enchantments, so they can be sacrificed to <auto-card>Enigmatic Incarnation</auto-card> as well.</li>
	<li><b>Omnath and fetch lands</b>: <auto-card>Omnath, Locus of Creation</auto-card> is an extremely powerful card, especially when <auto-card>Fabled Passage</auto-card> enables multiple triggers per turn. Since the deck already has at least 22 sources of each color, counting <auto-card>Fabled Passage</auto-card> and <auto-card>Urban Utopia</auto-card> as full sources for expositional ease<b>, </b>it should be easy to cast Omnath consistently on curve. Omnath is also an excellent follow-up to <auto-card>Fires of Invention</auto-card> and can be blinked with the companion <auto-card>Yorion, Sky Nomad</auto-card>.</li>
	<li><b>More Pathways than shock lands</b>: I could spend an entire day on the mana base of this deck, but Zhi deviates from stock lists by playing a large number of Pathways and a small number of shock lands. This means that he'll take fewer damage from his lands than five-color builds, which improves his matchup against aggro decks.</li>
</ul>

<p>While seeing <auto-card>Enigmatic Incarnation</auto-card> at the World Championship is not a major surprise, but Zhi's innovative build is.</p>

===decklistId:Selesnya_Angels_Yudai_Miyano_Magic_World_Championship_XXVIII_10_28_2022_c7e30029-2eda-4eb2-9f0a-1ac05edee7d2===

<p>Judai Miyano qualified for the World Championship by taking <auto-card>Righteous Valkyrie</auto-card> and <auto-card>Lunarch Veteran</auto-card> to a Top 6 finish at the Neon Dynasty Championship. For the World Championship, he stuck with the same cards, yet now in a Selesnya Angels shell.</p>

<p>I have faced Selesnya Angels a few times before in Explorer, so Miyano's deck is arguably the least “spicy” deck in this article. Still, as the only tribal player in the field, he deserves some recognition.</p>

<p>The game plan of Selesnya Angels is to use various life gain creatures to enable <auto-card>Righteous Valkyrie</auto-card> and to create additional board presence via <auto-card>Resplendent Angel</auto-card>. <auto-card>Giada, Font of Hope</auto-card> and <auto-card>Bishop of Wings</auto-card> are payoffs for focusing on the Angel tribe, and <auto-card>Collected Company</auto-card> ties it all together.</p>

<p><auto-card>Collected Company</auto-card> even makes it possible for <auto-card>Resplendent Angel</auto-card> to create two Angel tokens per turn cycle. Since it triggers at the beginning of <i>each</i> end step, you could gain 5 life with <auto-card>Bishop of Wings</auto-card> and <auto-card>Lunarch Veteran</auto-card> in your turn and then do the same by casting <auto-card>Collected Company</auto-card> in your opponent's beginning, main, or combat phase.</p>

===decklistId:Jund_Midrange_Shota_Yasooka_Magic_World_Championship_XXVIII_10_28_2022_2823fca1-fbe5-4901-893b-ba32ea48802f===

<p>Hall of Famer Shota Yasooka, who qualified for the World Championship via the League leaderboard, is one of the most renowned players and deck builders of all time. When I was playing Pro Tours, the first question on many players' minds as decklists were unveiled was: "What is Shota playing?” So when he effectively tells everyone that the stock build of the most-played archetype in Explorer is all wrong and that it doesn't even get the colors right, then we ought to pay attention.</p>

<p>Yasooka's tweak to Rakdos Midrange is to splash green for <auto-card>Esika's Chariot</auto-card>. He runs the vehicle instead of <auto-card>Sheoldred, the Apocalypse</auto-card> or other four-drops that would die easily to a spot removal spell without leaving any value behind. By contrast, if <auto-card>Esika's Chariot</auto-card> dies to <auto-card>Fatal Push</auto-card>, then at least two Cats will linger around. <auto-card>Esika's Chariot</auto-card> also enables fun interactions available involving <auto-card>Reflection of Kiki-Jiki</auto-card>. For example, if the Goblin Shaman makes a token copy of <auto-card>Graveyard Trespasser</auto-card>, then <auto-card>Esika's Chariot</auto-card> could create a copy of that token as well.</p>

<p>Yasooka's sideboard has additional green cards in <auto-card>Tear Asunder</auto-card> and <auto-card>Culling Ritual</auto-card>, which provide more options in various matchups. For example, the instant can exile <auto-card>Enigmatic Incarnation</auto-card>, and the sweeper can destroy multiple Spirits.</p>

<p>The green splash comes at the cost of a slightly more painful mana base with slightly fewer untapped black sources for a turn-one <auto-card>Thoughtseize</auto-card>, but there are enough black and red sources to consistently cast all other spells, and 11 green sources is sufficient. There's also some loss in utility from <auto-card>Castle Locthwain</auto-card>; <auto-card>Takenuma, Abandoned Mire</auto-card>; and <auto-card>Sokenzan, Crucible of Defiance</auto-card>. However, the power of the Chariot may make up for the slightly weaker mana base. Perhaps all Rakdos Midrange decks were built wrong and we should have been splashing for <auto-card>Esika's Chariot</auto-card> all along?</p>

<p>The Release Notes include information concerning the release of a new <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> set, as well as a collection of clarifications and rulings involving that set's cards. They are intended to make playing with the new cards more fun by clearing up the common misconceptions and confusion inevitably caused by new mechanics and interactions. As future sets are released, updates to the <em>Magic</em> rules may cause some of this information to become outdated. Go to <a href="http://magic.wizards.com/rules" target="_blank">Magic.Wizards.com/Rules</a> to find the most up-to-date rules.</p>

<p>The "General Notes" section includes information about card legality and explains some of the mechanics and concepts in the set.</p>

<p>The "Card-Specific Notes" sections contain answers to the most important, most common, and most confusing questions players might ask about cards in the set. Items in the "Card-Specific Notes" sections include full card text for your reference. Not all cards in the set are listed.</p>

<hr />
<h2>GENERAL NOTES</h2>

<h3>Card Legality</h3>

<p>The <em>Dominaria</em> <em>Remastered </em>set becomes legal for sanctioned Limited play on its official release date: January 13, 2023. Cards in this release are legal for Constructed play in any format that already allows them; that is, appearing in <em>Dominaria Remastered</em> doesn't change a card's legality in any format. Notably, many of these cards are not legal in the Standard and Pioneer formats.</p>

<p>Go to <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/formats" target="_blank">Magic.Wizards.com/Formats</a> for a complete list of formats and their permitted card sets and banned lists.</p>

<p>Go to <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/Commander" target="_blank">Magic.Wizards.com/Commander</a> for more information on the Commander variant.</p>

<p>Go to <a href="https://locator.wizards.com/" target="_blank">Locator.Wizards.com</a> to find an event or store near you.</p>

<hr />
<h3>Returning Abilities</h3>

<p><em>Dominaria Remastered </em>features several returning keywords and other mechanics. A few of the more prevalent ones are included in this section, while others will have rulings in the "Card-Specific Notes" section below. The rules for these mechanics are unchanged in this release, although some rules have changed since cards featuring these mechanics were first printed.</p>

<hr />
<h3>Returning Keyword: Flashback</h3>

<p>Flashback's back. Back again. Flashback gives some instants and sorceries in the graveyard one more chance to wreak some havoc.</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/dmr/en_04d92ba319.png" /></p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;">Call of the Herd<br />
{2}{G}<br />
Sorcery<br />
Create a 3/3 green Elephant creature token.<br />
Flashback {3}{G} <em>(You may cast this card from your graveyard for its flashback cost. Then exile it.)</em></p>

<ul>
	<li>"Flashback [cost]" means "You may cast this card from your graveyard by paying [cost] rather than paying its mana cost" and "If the flashback cost was paid, exile this card instead of putting it anywhere else any time it would leave the stack."</li>
	<li>You must still follow any timing restrictions and permissions, including those based on the card's type. For example, you can cast a sorcery using flashback only when you could normally cast a sorcery.</li>
	<li>To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost (such as a flashback cost) you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions. The mana value of the spell is determined only by its mana cost, no matter what the total cost to cast the spell was.</li>
	<li>A spell cast using flashback will always be exiled afterward, regardless of whether it resolves, is countered, or leaves the stack in some other way.</li>
	<li>You can cast a card using flashback even if it was somehow put into your graveyard without having been cast.</li>
	<li>If a card with flashback is put into your graveyard during your turn, you can cast it if it's legal to do so before any other player can take any actions.</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<h3>Returning Keyword: Madness</h3>

<p>Discarding cards is often an opportunity lost. You could have cast that card! With madness, you can have your cake and water it too. Or something.</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/dmr/en_b38e6e0da7.png" /></p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;">Dark Withering<br />
{4}{B}{B}<br />
Instant<br />
Destroy target nonblack creature.<br />
Madness {B} <em>(If you discard this card, discard it into exile. When you do, cast it for its madness cost or put it into your graveyard.)</em></p>

<ul>
	<li>Cards are discarded in a <em>Magic</em> game only from a player's hand. Effects that put cards into a player's graveyard from anywhere else do not cause those cards to be discarded.</li>
	<li>Madness works independently of why you're discarding the card. You could discard it to pay a cost, because a spell or ability tells you to, or because you have too many cards in your hand during your cleanup step. You can't discard a card with madness just because you want to, though.</li>
	<li>A card with madness that's discarded counts as having been discarded even though it's put into exile rather than a graveyard. If it was discarded to pay a cost, that cost is still paid. Abilities that trigger when a card is discarded will still trigger.</li>
	<li>A spell cast for its madness cost is put onto the stack like any other spell. It can be countered, copied, and so on. As it resolves, it's put onto the battlefield if it's a permanent card or into its owner's graveyard if it's an instant or sorcery card.</li>
	<li>Casting a spell with madness ignores the timing rules based on the card's card type. For example, you can cast a sorcery with madness if you discard it during an opponent's turn.</li>
	<li>To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost (such as a madness cost) you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions. The mana value of the spell is determined by only its mana cost, no matter what the total cost to cast that spell was.</li>
	<li>If you choose not to cast a card with madness when the madness triggered ability resolves, it's put into your graveyard. Madness doesn't give you another chance to cast it later.</li>
	<li>If you discard a card with madness to pay the cost of a spell or activated ability, that card's madness triggered ability (and the spell that card becomes, if you choose to cast it) will resolve before the spell or ability the discard paid for.</li>
	<li>If you discard a card with madness while a spell or ability is resolving, it moves immediately to exile. Continue resolving that spell or ability, noting that the card you discarded is not in your graveyard at this time. Its madness triggered ability will be placed onto the stack once that spell or ability has completely resolved.</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<h3>Returning Mechanic: Split Cards</h3>

<p>Split cards offer flexibility by combining two card faces into a single card. You may not have all the answers, but you'll have at least one more answer than you otherwise might have!</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/dmr/en_193eaa336d.png" style="transform:rotate(90deg);" /></p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;">Assault // Battery<br />
{R}<br />
Sorcery<br />
Assault deals 2 damage to any target.<br />
//<br />
Battery<br />
{3}{G}<br />
Sorcery<br />
Create a 3/3 green Elephant creature token.</p>

<ul>
	<li>To cast a split card, choose one of its halves to cast. There's no way to cast both halves of any of the split cards featured in this set.</li>
	<li>Split cards have two card faces on a single card. The characteristics of the half you didn't cast are ignored while the spell is on the stack.</li>
	<li>Each split card is a single card. For example, if you discard a split card, you've discarded one card, not two. If an effect counts the number of sorcery cards in your graveyard, Assault // Battery counts once, not twice.</li>
	<li>Each split card has two names. If an effect instructs you to choose a card name, you may choose one of those names, but not both.</li>
	<li>A split card's characteristics are a combination of its two halves while it is not on the stack. For example, Assault // Battery has a mana value of 5 while it is in your library. If an effect allows you to search your library for a card with mana value 4 or less, you can't find Assault // Battery.</li>
	<li>If an effect allows you to cast a spell with certain characteristics, consider only the characteristics of the half you're casting. For example, if an effect allows you to cast a sorcery spell with mana value 2 or less from among cards in your graveyard, you could cast Assault this way, but not Battery.</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<h2>CARD-SPECIFIC NOTES</h2>

<p class="rtecenter"><img src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/dmr/en_bd54ba4253.png" /></p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;">Absorb<br />
{W}{U}{U}<br />
Instant<br />
Counter target spell. You gain 3 life.</p>

<ul>
	<li>A spell that can't be countered is a legal target for Absorb. The spell won't be countered when Absorb resolves, but you'll still gain 3 life.</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<p class="rtecenter"><img src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/dmr/en_b24b75e098.png" /></p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;">Aquamoeba<br />
{1}{U}<br />
Creature — Elemental Beast<br />
1/3<br />
Discard a card: Switch Aquamoeba's power and toughness until end of turn.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Effects that switch a creature's power and toughness apply after all other effects, regardless of when those effects began to apply. For example, if Aquamoeba's ability resolves and then you somehow give it +4/+0 later in the turn, it's a 3/5 creature, not a 7/1 creature.</li>
	<li>Because damage remains marked on a creature until the damage is removed as the turn ends, nonlethal damage dealt to a creature may become lethal if you switch its power and toughness during that turn.</li>
	<li>Switching a creature's power and toughness twice (or any even number of times) effectively returns the creature's power and toughness to their values before any switches.</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<p class="rtecenter"><img src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/dmr/en_15413abe73.png" /></p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;">Arboria<br />
{2}{G}{G}<br />
World Enchantment<br />
Creatures can't attack a player unless that player cast a spell or put a nontoken permanent onto the battlefield during their last turn.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Arboria doesn't stop creatures from attacking planeswalkers, regardless of what their controllers did or didn't do during their last turns.</li>
	<li>Arboria's effect cares whether a player put a nontoken permanent onto the battlefield. It's unusual for an ability to care who put a permanent onto the battlefield, as opposed to under whose control it entered.</li>
	<li>Arboria's effect cares about the actions taken by players, not their results. If a player cast a spell during their last turn but that spell was countered, that player may still be attacked. The same is true if a player put a nontoken permanent onto the battlefield during their last turn, but that permanent left the battlefield before their turn ended.</li>
	<li>If two or more permanents have the world supertype, all of them are put into their owners' graveyards except the one that has had the world supertype for the shortest amount of time. If there's a tie for the shortest amount of time, all world permanents are put into the graveyard.</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<p class="rtecenter"><img src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/dmr/en_ad955d2832.png" /></p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;">Arcades Sabboth<br />
{2}{G}{G}{W}{W}{U}{U}<br />
Legendary Creature — Elder Dragon<br />
7/7<br />
Flying<br />
At the beginning of your upkeep, sacrifice Arcades Sabboth unless you pay {G}{W}{U}.<br />
Each untapped creature you control gets +0/+2 as long as it's not attacking.<br />
{W}: Arcades Sabboth gets +0/+1 until end of turn.</p>

<ul>
	<li>As long as Arcades Sabboth is untapped and isn't attacking, it gets +0/+2 from its own third ability.</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<p class="rtecenter"><img src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/dmr/en_ba1d59ffa5.png" /></p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;">Arcanis the Omnipotent<br />
{3}{U}{U}{U}<br />
Legendary Creature — Wizard<br />
3/4<br />
{T}: Draw three cards.<br />
{2}{U}{U}: Return Arcanis the Omnipotent to its owner's hand.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Arcanis's last ability can be activated only while it's on the battlefield.</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<p class="rtecenter"><img src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/dmr/en_8fcda37e1e.png" /></p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;">Battle Screech<br />
{2}{W}{W}<br />
Sorcery<br />
Create two 1/1 white Bird creature tokens with flying.<br />
Flashback—Tap three untapped white creatures you control. <em>(You may cast this card from your graveyard for its flashback cost. Then exile it.)</em></p>

<ul>
	<li>You can tap any untapped white creatures you control to pay for Battle Screech's flashback cost, even ones you haven't controlled continuously since the beginning of your most recent turn.</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<p class="rtecenter"><img src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/dmr/en_4e253d92ba.png" /></p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;">Battlefield Scrounger<br />
{3}{G}{G}<br />
Creature — Centaur<br />
3/3<br />
<em>Threshold</em> — Put three cards from your graveyard on the bottom of your library: Battlefield Scrounger gets +3/+3 until end of turn. Activate only once each turn and only if seven or more cards are in your graveyard.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Check the number of cards in your graveyard before activating the ability. If activating the ability causes that number to fall below seven, the ability still resolves as normal.</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<p class="rtecenter"><img src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/dmr/en_75247f1ae6.png" /></p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;">Body Snatcher<br />
{2}{B}{B}<br />
Creature — Phyrexian Minion<br />
2/2<br />
When Body Snatcher enters the battlefield, exile it unless you discard a creature card.<br />
When Body Snatcher dies, exile it and return target creature card from your graveyard to the battlefield.</p>

<ul>
	<li>You choose whether to discard a card or not as the enters-the-battlefield ability resolves.</li>
	<li>Although you can choose Body Snatcher itself as the target of its last ability, it will be exiled before it can be returned to the battlefield.</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<p class="rtecenter"><img src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/dmr/en_edc6a64f86.png" /></p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;">Chain Lightning<br />
{R}<br />
Sorcery<br />
Chain Lightning deals 3 damage to any target. Then that player or that permanent's controller may pay {R}{R}. If the player does, they may copy this spell and may choose a new target for that copy.</p>

<ul>
	<li>As Chain Lightning resolves, either the original or one of the copies, the targeted player or the controller of the targeted permanent may copy it. The copy has the same text, target, and color as the resolving spell, though the player creating the copy may choose a new target for it. Once that copy is created (or not), the Chain Lightning finishes resolving and leaves the stack.</li>
	<li>The player putting the copy of the spell on the stack controls that copy.</li>
	<li>The copy of Chain Lightning is created on the stack, so it's not cast. Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger. Players may respond to that spell before it resolves.</li>
	<li>If the targeted player or permanent is an illegal target as Chain Lightning tries to resolve, the spell doesn't resolve and none of its effects happen. It can't be copied.</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<p class="rtecenter"><img src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/dmr/en_7169928d2e.png" /></p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;">Chainer, Dementia Master<br />
{3}{B}{B}<br />
Legendary Creature — Human Minion<br />
3/3<br />
All Nightmares get +1/+1.<br />
{B}{B}{B}, Pay 3 life: Put target creature card from a graveyard onto the battlefield under your control. That creature is black and is a Nightmare in addition to its other creature types.<br />
When Chainer, Dementia Master leaves the battlefield, exile all Nightmares.</p>

<ul>
	<li>The creature put onto the battlefield by Chainer's activated ability is black only, not black in addition to its other colors. It is, however, a Nightmare in addition to its other creature types. As it enters the battlefield, it is already a black Nightmare (and perhaps some other creature types); it doesn't enter and then become a black Nightmare.</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<p class="rtecenter"><img src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/dmr/en_7f237f40e1.png" /></p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;">Circular Logic<br />
{2}{U}<br />
Instant<br />
Counter target spell unless its controller pays {1} for each card in your graveyard.<br />
Madness {U} <em>(If you discard this card, discard it into exile. When you do, cast it for its madness cost or put it into your graveyard.)</em></p>

<ul>
	<li>Count the number of cards in your graveyard as Circular Logic resolves to determine how much the controller of the target spell has to pay. Circular Logic is still on the stack at that time. It doesn't count itself.</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<p class="rtecenter"><img src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/dmr/en_e44d39defb.png" /></p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;">Cleric of the Forward Order<br />
{1}{W}<br />
Creature — Human Cleric<br />
2/2<br />
When Cleric of the Forward Order enters the battlefield, you gain 2 life for each creature you control named Cleric of the Forward Order.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Count the number of creatures named Cleric of the Forward Order you control as the ability resolves to determine how much life you gain. If the Cleric of the Forward Order with the ability that triggered is still on the battlefield, it will count itself.</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<p class="rtecenter"><img src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/dmr/en_bcbe98f58a.png" /></p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;">Cloud of Faeries<br />
{1}{U}<br />
Creature — Faerie<br />
1/1<br />
Flying<br />
When Cloud of Faeries enters the battlefield, untap up to two lands.<br />
Cycling {2} <em>({2}, Discard this card: Draw a card.)</em></p>

<ul>
	<li>You choose which lands to untap as the triggered ability resolves. They aren't targeted, and they don't have to be lands that you control.</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<p class="rtecenter"><img src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/dmr/en_06363fa472.png" /></p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;">Coal Stoker<br />
{3}{R}<br />
Creature — Elemental<br />
3/3<br />
When Coal Stoker enters the battlefield, if you cast it from your hand, add {R}{R}{R}.</p>

<ul>
	<li>If a nontoken creature enters the battlefield as a copy of this creature, the copy's enters-the-battlefield ability will still trigger as long as you cast the spell that became that nontoken creature from your hand.</li>
	<li>If a token is created that's a copy of Coal Stoker, the token wasn't cast, and Coal Stoker's ability won't trigger. Similarly, if an effect copies Coal Stoker while it's on the stack, the copy becomes a token, but the copy was created on the stack and not cast from your hand, so the ability won't trigger in that case either.</li>
	<li>Coal Stoker's ability isn't a mana ability. It uses the stack and can be responded to.</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<p class="rtecenter"><img src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/dmr/en_5d1b4f0133.png" /></p>

{4}{U}{U}<br />
Enchantment — Aura<br />
Enchant permanent<br />
You control enchanted permanent.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Gaining control of a permanent doesn't cause you to gain control of any Auras or Equipment attached to it.</li>
	<li>Gaining control of an Aura or Equipment doesn't change what it's attached to.</li>
</ul>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;">Crop Rotation<br />
{G}<br />
Instant<br />
As an additional cost to cast this spell, sacrifice a land.<br />
Search your library for a land card, put that card onto the battlefield, then shuffle.</p>

<ul>
	<li>You can't cast Crop Rotation without sacrificing a land, and you can't sacrifice additional lands.</li>
</ul>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;">Cryptic Gateway<br />
{5}<br />
Artifact<br />
Tap two untapped creatures you control: You may put a creature card from your hand that shares a creature type with each creature tapped this way onto the battlefield.</p>

<ul>
	<li>The two creatures you tap to activate the ability don't necessarily have to share a creature type, but the creature card you put onto the battlefield must share a creature type with each of them. For example, you could tap an Elf Wizard and a Human Warrior to put an Elf Warrior card onto the battlefield.</li>
	<li>You can tap any untapped creatures you control to activate Cryptic Gateway's ability, even ones you haven't controlled continuously since the beginning of your most recent turn.</li>
</ul>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;">Damping Sphere<br />
{2}<br />
Artifact<br />
If a land is tapped for two or more mana, it produces {C} instead of any other type and amount.<br />
Each spell a player casts costs {1} more to cast for each other spell that player has cast this turn.</p>

<ul>
	<li>If multiple replacement effects would modify the mana an ability you control produces, choose one to apply. After that, determine if any others are applicable. A replacement effect can't apply to the same event more than once.</li>
	<li>Damping Sphere's second ability counts spells that were cast during a turn even if Damping Sphere wasn't on the battlefield as they were cast. For example, if Damping Sphere itself is the third spell you cast in a turn, the next spell you cast costs {3} more to cast.</li>
	<li>To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost (such as a flashback cost) you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions. The mana value of the spell is determined only by its mana cost, no matter what the total cost to cast the spell was.</li>

	<li>If you control other triggered abilities that allow you to draw cards during your draw step, you can choose to order Sylvan Library's ability before or after those abilities. Triggered abilities controlled by other players will resolve before triggered abilities you control.</li>
	<li>Any cards drawn prior to Sylvan Library's ability resolving, including in your upkeep or in response to Sylvan Library's triggered ability, can be chosen to be put back using this effect. Sylvan Library's controller is responsible for keeping these cards distinguishable in hand, such as by keeping them separate from cards that began the turn in hand.</li>
	<li>If you control more than one Sylvan Library, the triggered ability of each will resolve in sequence. You don't get to draw all the cards at once and then put them all back at once.</li>
	<li>You can put back zero, one, or two cards.</li>
	<li>If you choose to draw two cards, then replace one or more of those draws with some other effect, the rest of Sylvan Library's ability still happens. If you've actually drawn only one card that turn, you must choose that card and either pay 4 life or put it on top of your library. If you haven't actually drawn any cards that turn, the rest of the ability has no effect.</li>

For example, say a Triskelion with two +1/+1 counters on it has been dealt 2 damage earlier in the turn. If you activate its ability by removing a +1/+1 counter from it, it now has 2 toughness and is destroyed as a state-based action.

At the beginning of your upkeep, if a player has more life than each other player, the player with the most life gains control of Wild Dogs.<br />
Cycling {2} <em>({2}, Discard this card: Draw a card.)</em></p>

<ul>
	<li>Wild Dogs's first ability will check life totals as your upkeep begins, before any player has the opportunity to take any actions. If no one player has more life than all other players at that time (i.e., if two or more players are tied for the most life), the ability won't trigger at all. If the ability does trigger, it will check again as it tries to resolve. If no player has more life than all others by that point, the ability won't have any effect. The player who had the most life as the ability triggered doesn't have to be the same player as the one who has the most life as the ability resolves.</li>

When Worldgorger Dragon leaves the battlefield, return the exiled cards to the battlefield under their owners' control.</p>

<ul>
	<li>If Worldgorger Dragon leaves the battlefield before its enters-the-battlefield ability resolves, the "leaves-the-battlefield" ability will trigger and resolve first. It won't return anything. Then the enters-the-battlefield ability will exile all other permanents you control indefinitely.</li>
	<li>If an Aura is exiled with Worldgorger Dragon and then returns to the battlefield, the player who controls the Aura as it enters the battlefield chooses what it will enchant. An Aura put onto the battlefield this way doesn't target anything (so it could be attached to an opponent's permanent with hexproof, for example), but the Aura's enchant ability restricts what it can be attached to. If the Aura can't legally be attached to anything, it stays exiled. It can't enter the battlefield enchanting a permanent that enters the battlefield at the same time.</li>

When Wormfang Drake leaves the battlefield, return the exiled card to the battlefield under its owner's control.</p>

	<li>If you don't control any other creatures as the enters-the-battlefield ability resolves, you must sacrifice Wormfang Drake.</li>
	<li>If Wormfang Drake leaves the battlefield before its enters-the-battlefield ability resolves, the "leaves-the-battlefield" ability will trigger and resolve first. It won't return anything.

{B}{B}, Discard a card: Proliferate. <em>(Choose any number of permanents and/or players, then give each another counter of each kind already there.)</em></p>

<ul>
	<li>If a permanent has +1/+1 counters and -1/-1 counters on it, they're removed in pairs as a state-based action until that permanent has only one of those kinds of counters on it.</li>
	<li>To proliferate, you can choose any permanent that has a counter, including ones controlled by opponents. You can't choose cards in any zone other than the battlefield, even if they have counters on them.</li>
	<li>You don't have to choose every permanent or player that has a counter, only the ones you want to add another counter to. Since "any number" includes zero, you don't have to choose any permanents at all, and you don't have to choose any players at all.</li>
	<li>Players can respond to a spell or ability whose effect includes proliferating. Once that spell or ability starts to resolve, however, and its controller chooses which permanents and players will get new counters, it's too late for anyone to respond.</li>

<p>We've made a few changes this time around that we think you'll enjoy. A big one: this year's Arena Decathlon is open
  to <em>MTG Arena </em>players of all ages! We've also shortened the Arena Decathlon Finals to make it easier for
  finalists to complete the event. Plus, you'll find an improved prize structure for preliminary events, with more
  opportunities to earn a prize!</p>
<h2>Arena Decathlon Preliminary Events</h2>
<p>Preliminary events are scheduled as pairs, each open for three days and featuring a different game mode. For example,
  you can enter <em>Jump In! </em>and Pauper from 8 a.m. PT on January 1 until 8 a.m. PT on January 4. On January 4, the
  next set of events will open at 8 a.m. PT for their three-day run.</p>
<p>Everyone who enters an Arena Decathlon event will receive a special Bronze Sundering Titan sleeve!</p>

  </div>
  <p>You can compete as often as you like in preliminary events, and each offers prizes, with maximum wins earning you that particular event's coveted Arena Decathlon token—seven wins for Best-of-One events, and five wins for traditional Best-of-Three events. Collect tokens for more goodies, and if you earn at least three tokens from events, you'll score an invitation to the Arena Decathlon Finals!</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>3 Tokens = 1 Arena Decathlon Finals entry + Silver Sundering Titan sleeve</li>
<li>7 Tokens = 2 Arena Decathlon Finals entries + Silver Sundering Titan sleeve</li>
<li>10 Tokens = 2 Arena Decathlon Finals entries + Silver Sundering Titan sleeve + Gold Sundering Titan sleeve + 10 Play-In Points</li>
</ul>

<p>Each Decathlon token earned toward an Arena Decathlon Finals entry must be unique; <em>multiple tokens from the same event only count as a single Decathlon token from that event</em>—so play lots of different events!</p>
<p>You can track which Decathlon tokens you've earned in <em>MTG Arena </em>by hovering over the token icon in the desktop client or by tapping it on mobile.</p>

  <p>Finally, collect tokens from all ten Arena Decathlon preliminary events, and you'll score the Gold Sundering Titan sleeve when entering the Arena Decathlon Finals that proclaims your mastery of MTG Arena game modes whenever you display it in battle!</p>

  </div>
<p>The Gold Sundering Titan sleeve and Arena Decathlon Finals tokens will be granted by Wednesday, January 18, following the conclusion of the preliminary events. The Silver Sundering Titan sleeve will be granted upon entering the Arena Decathlon Finals event.</p>

<h2>Arena Decathlon Finals</h2>
<p>If you have earned at least three Arena Decathlon tokens from the preliminary events, you can enter the Arena Decathlon Finals that begin on Saturday, January 21, where a slew of prizes await—including the top prize: a voucher that will grant you one of every card in the forthcoming <em>Phyrexia: All Will Be One </em>set when it is released!</p>
<p>If you performed exceptionally well in the Arena Decathlon preliminary events and earned seven or more tokens, you can enter the Arena Decathlon Finals twice! That's a lot of prizes you could win, not to mention the possibility of getting <em>two</em> vouchers for <em>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</em> if you sweep the finals both times you enter!</p>
<p>All that stands in your way are the other top players in <em>MTG Arena </em>who also want those prizes, so no pressure!</p>

<p><strong>Popularity: Very Popular/Popular</strong></p>

<p>Modal double-faced cards (MDFCs) were introduced in <em>Zendikar Rising</em> as cards with lands on the back. They then appeared in<em> Kaldheim</em> on the Gods. Finally, they were in <em>Strixhaven: School of Mages </em>on the Deans and some spells. The land versions were the most popular and the Deans were the least popular (for being too wordy on the back). Players seemed to really like MDFCs, but there are some lessons we learned about what makes them most appealing (keep the back simple). Also, I should point out that DFCs as a category (which includes transforming DFCs) is quite popular with players.</p>

<p><strong>Design Space: Large</strong></p>

<p>This is more of a tool than a mechanic, and there are a lot of things you can do with it. The biggest issue is that choice is powerful, so the two sides must each be costed with that in mind, which does have some impact on what you can design (while keeping things exciting). There's also a conversation to be had about when to use split cards versus when to use MDFCs. Our current policy is to avoid DFCs that could be split cards.</p>

<p><strong>Versatility: Flexible</strong></p>

<p>The reason you don't want one MDFC in a set is mostly about production and logistics rather than game design. An MDFC being in a set doesn't cause the set to have to change much, mechanically speaking. Adding a few ways to get cards back to your hand so you can cast them as the other side makes the biggest impact.</p>

<p><strong>Development/Play Design: Neutral/Not Problematic</strong></p>

<p>Play design does a lot of spells with choices (such as split cards or cards with kicker), so MDFCs aren't really adding something to the table that they aren't familiar with. Andrew has told me that the trickiest MDFCs to balance are the MDFC lands, as their play design is very time-consuming because there are a lot of numbers to figure out.</p>

<p><strong>Playability: Playability Affected</strong></p>

<p>MDFCs require sleeves or a checklist card. There are memory issues with what's on the backside (why wordy backs are unliked). They also have some weird rules interactions.</p>

<p><strong>Storm Scale: 4</strong></p>

<p>MDFCs, when done in moderation and considering how easy they are to process in your hand, play well and are very popular. They also have a huge amount of flexibility, allowing us to do cool new things with them in the future. I'm quite optimistic we'll be seeing them again. I do want to note they're more of a design tool than a mechanic, so I believe there's also a lot of new design space to explore where it's doing something a little different than what's already been done.</p>

<h2>Party (<em>Zendikar Rising</em>)</h2>

<p><magic-card>Squad Commander</magic-card><magic-card>Coveted Prize</magic-card><magic-card>Linvala, Shield of Sea Gate</magic-card></p>

<p><strong>Popularity: Unpopular</strong></p>

<p>Party was the least popular of the named keywords from <em>Zendikar Rising</em>. Like mutate, it did have its fans who are quite fond of it, but overall, it was not a hit with the players.</p>

<p><strong>Design Space: Medium/Small</strong></p>

<p>If you're talking about the larger use of batching creature types together, there's a decent amount of space. Focusing specifically on the batch that is party, the design space gets a lot smaller. The effect needs to have an upgrade <em>and</em> tie into creature strategies, as party requires having a lot of creatures on the battlefield.</p>

<p><strong>Versatility: Rigid</strong></p>

<p>Party requires a lot of structure to support it, not just in the set itself, but in the sets around it. One of the biggest strikes against party (and my guess why the rating was low) is that it was hard to successfully build competitive Constructed decks with it. It just required too many different pieces to all work. Not a lot of Constructed decks can manage to keep four different creatures on the battlefield, for example.</p>

<p><strong>Development/Play Design: Problematic</strong></p>

<p>This was one of only two mechanics that Andrew dubbed "problematic." Party requires a lot of support to be viable, and it's dependent on a heavy creature-based strategy that's hard to make work in competitive formats.</p>

<p><strong>Playability: Playability Affected</strong></p>

<p>It requires constant monitoring of what creature types you have. This is especially hard for an opponent who is less familiar with the deck.</p>

<p><strong>Storm Scale: 8</strong></p>

<p>Not beloved and hard to balance—not a recipe for a return, but there was something lovable about the flavor, and I do see players requesting that we bring it back.</p>

<h2>Snap-on Equipment (<em>Ravnica</em>, <em>Mirrodin Besieged</em>, <em>Ixalan</em>, <em>Throne of Eldraine</em>, and <em>Zendikar Rising</em>)</h2>

<p><magic-card>Maul of the Skyclaves</magic-card><magic-card>Mind Carver</magic-card><magic-card>Skyclave Pick-Axe</magic-card></p>

<p><strong>Popularity: Popular</strong></p>

<p>Players generally like Equipment but aren't overly excited by it. It's flavorful and plays well. Snap-on Equipment is on the higher end of Equipment players enjoy. Players tend to like getting free things, so a free equip is well regarded.</p>

<p><strong>Design Space: Medium</strong></p>

<p>Most Equipment effects could snap on, so the design space is of a decent size. There are some in R&amp;D who believe all Equipment should snap on because they think it plays better. The other side believes that Equipment already feels better than Auras and that the free attach would just make Auras feel even worse.</p>

<p><strong>Versatility: Flexible</strong></p>

<p>Sets can have any number of Equipment, even one, and any Equipment could snap on, so it doesn't do much to dictate the structure of the set it's in.</p>

<p><strong>Development/Play Design: Not Problematic</strong></p>

<p>Snap-on Equipment is easy to balance and plays well. The only issue Andrew brought up is that it adds a line break that can cause problems with wordier effects.</p>

<p><strong>Playability: Playability Not Affected</strong></p>

<p>There are no major issues (rules, memory, logistics, play aid, etc.).</p>

<p><strong>Storm Scale: 2</strong></p>

<p>Equipment is evergreen, so I'd call snap-on Equipment deciduous. Any set with Equipment can consider using it.</p>

<h2>Boast (<em>Kaldheim</em>)</h2>

<p><magic-card>Usher of the Fallen</magic-card><magic-card>Varragoth, Bloodsky Sire</magic-card><magic-card>Dragonkin Berserker</magic-card></p>

<p><strong>Popularity: Not Popular</strong></p>

<p>Boast fell in the bottom 25%. I think people saw this as a drawback mechanic—"here's a cool activated ability that you can't use all the time." It was meant as an attack trigger that required mana, but I understand that how we template a mechanic matters a great deal in how it's publicly perceived.</p>

<p><strong>Design Space: Medium</strong></p>

<p>Boast is near the line between small and medium, so I was kind to it. Boast activations usually want to be something that's relevant during combat, although sometimes it's just an ability that you must risk the creature to access. Boast is yet another example of a mechanic that has a smaller vein of good design space that plays well inside a larger vein that's potentially doable. When grading future design space, I'm counting what we'd print and not what technically could be printed on a card.</p>

<p><strong>Versatility: Neutral</strong></p>

<p>Every set has creature combat, so boast could work in most sets, but to optimize it, you really want a set that's more focused on creature combat than the average, and you probably want some cards that encourage or aid you in attacking.</p>

<p><strong>Development/Play Design: Not Problematic</strong></p>

<p>To quote Andrew: "A creature-centric attacking mechanic that involves mana is play design's bread and butter."</p>

<p><strong>Playability: Playability Not Affected</strong></p>

<p>Boast has no rules issues, no memory issues, and no play-aide issues. There's the tiny logistical issue of tracking what creatures are attacking, but the game makes you pay close attention to that anyway.</p>

<p><strong>Storm Scale: 6</strong></p>

<p>Boast would be easy to bring back, and in the right set, we'd consider it, but it's not the kind of mechanic players clamor for a return.</p>

<h2>Changeling (<em>Lorwyn</em> block, <em>Modern Horizons</em>, and <em>Kaldheim</em>)</h2>

<p><magic-card>Orvar, the All-Form</magic-card><magic-card>Realmwalker</magic-card><magic-card mvid="503856">Maskwood Nexus</magic-card></p>

<p><strong>Popularity: Very Popular</strong></p>

<p>Creature-type themes are very popular, so it comes as no surprise that the best creature-type glue we've ever made is a hit with the players.</p>

<p><strong>Design Space: Large</strong></p>

<p>Any creature could have changeling mechanically if we wanted. It would raise the cost on most cards, but there's a huge number of potential designs we could make.</p>

<p><strong>Versatility: Neutral</strong></p>

<p>You wouldn't put a creature with changeling in a set unless that set has a creature-type theme in it. Most do, so the barrier is low, but odds are when you're including it that creature types play a larger role than normal.</p>

<p><strong>Development/Play Design: Neutral</strong></p>

<p>Play design has learned over time that the way to balance creatures with changeling is to have it cost a lot for the effect, because when it does matter, the effect can be quite strong, especially in older formats.</p>

<p><strong>Playability: Playability Not Affected</strong></p>

<p>Creatures with changeling force you to monitor for creature-type effects, but that's usually a theme your deck is dedicated to, so it's something you're already looking out for.</p>

<p><strong>Storm Scale: 4</strong></p>

<p>Players adore changeling, and it's good glue for a creature-type set, something we make often. I have every belief that we'll see it return, most likely numerous times.</p>

<h2>Foretell (<em>Kaldheim</em>)</h2>

<p><magic-card>Starnheim Unleashed</magic-card><magic-card>Behold the Multiverse</magic-card><magic-card>Haunting Voyage</magic-card></p>

<p><strong>Popularity: Very Popular</strong></p>

<p>Foretell was the most popular new mechanic in <em>Kaldheim</em>, and one of the more popular mechanics of the time frame of this Storm Scale article.</p>

<p><strong>Design Space: Medium</strong></p>

<p>Foretell can go on any card type, but it tends to want to be on an effect where foreknowledge will lead to interesting game interactions. While this isn't a narrow category, it's not as robust as one might assume. In other words, you can put foretell on just about any effect, but not every effect wants to have foretell or will necessarily play better because of foretell.</p>

<p><strong>Versatility: Neutral</strong></p>

<p>Foretell is a good example of a mechanic that can be dropped in a set and work but is better if the set builds in tools to optimize it. You want to create moments where you can make plays that consider that you have the foretell available, which requires pushing the design in certain directions.</p>

<p><strong>Development/Play Design: Neutral</strong></p>

<p>The tricky part about balancing foretell cards for Constructed formats is that you want enough of them to be relevant so the opponent doesn't automatically know what the foretell card is. Meaning you need to pick enough effects that will matter to the Constructed formats you're building toward, which further limits what effects make for the best foretell cards.</p>

<p><strong>Playability: Playability Affected</strong></p>

<p>There are logistical issues to putting a card in a zone other than the battlefield while remembering that it's relevant to the game. In addition, the face-down nature of it requires some extra concentration by all players.</p>

<p><strong>Storm Scale: 4</strong></p>

<p>Foretell was a big hit, and it's flexible enough that it has uses in various types of sets, so I'm optimistic we will see it return.</p>

<h2>Snow (<em>Ice Age</em> block, <em>Coldsnap</em>, <em>Future Sight</em>, <em>Commander (2019 Edition)</em>, <em>Modern Horizons</em>, and <em>Kaldheim</em>)</h2>

<p><magic-card>Search for Glory</magic-card><magic-card>Ascendant Spirit</magic-card><magic-card>Woodland Chasm</magic-card></p>

<p><strong>Popularity: Popular</strong></p>

<p>Snow ended up in the second quarter of the polling. Overall, it was well liked, but it was more polarizing than the average mechanic. Fans of the snow supertype adore it, but others were cold on it (pun intentional).</p>

<p><strong>Design Space: Large</strong></p>

<p>Technically, the snow supertype has a huge design space. Most cards, if flavored correctly, could have it, but we tend not to include it unless there's a larger reason for it. There has been a lot of debate in R&amp;D about whether all cards that match the flavor should have the supertype, but there's a big worry that it leads down a slippery path where we include a lot of extra words for minimal mechanical payoff. Why stop at cold things having their own supertype? Once you open that Pandora's box, things can get quite crazy if you let them.</p>

<p><strong>Versatility: Neutral/Rigid</strong></p>

<p>That argument has a lot of sway with how you judge this category. If you believe snow should only show up when it's mechanically relevant, then there's a decent restriction on when you can use it because it requires an environment where snow makes sense in addition to a mechanical reason for its existence. If you're on the other end of the argument where you feel it's something to make cards mechanically relevant in the big picture, but not necessarily in the set, there's a lot more freedom for when you can use it.</p>

<p><strong>Development/Play Design: Neutral</strong></p>

<p>The current rule is that we only add snow when it's mechanically relevant, so it adds an extra layer of mana requirements whenever we use it. This is the biggest deal in Draft where we have to make sure we're setting the levels right that enough people can draft snow mana sources without it being too easy to do so. It's also the kind of mechanic that we must be very careful with for larger formats because the runway to make something relevant without causing problems is narrow.</p>

<p><strong>Playability: Playability Affected</strong></p>

<p>Snow requires the monitoring of snow permanents. As this can be any permanent type, it sometimes is hard to keep track of, especially for the opponent who is less familiar with the deck.</p>

<p><strong>Storm Scale: 5</strong></p>

<p>Snow has a lot of fans, and we make plenty of environments where it flavorfully can work, so I'm confident snow will be the kind of mechanic that shows up from time to time, although my guess is not too frequently.</p>

<h2>Lessons and Learn (<em>Strixhaven: School of Mages</em>)</h2>

<p><magic-card>Divide by Zero</magic-card><magic-card>Mascot Exhibition</magic-card><magic-card>Environmental Sciences</magic-card></p>

<p><strong>Popularity: Liked</strong></p>

<p>Lessons and cards with learn were in the third quarter of polling. They're tricky in Draft and not playable in Commander, so I think most players don't have much experience with them. The players who have opted in to playing Lessons and learn spells do seem to enjoy the gameplay.</p>

<p><strong>Design Space: Medium</strong></p>

<p>There's a decent amount of design space for Lessons and the learn mechanic. I could imagine that different sets will want to be fetching different things, but I'm intrigued by the scope of what these mechanics hint at. That said, any mechanic that lets you choose from a variety of options is more powerful than it might seem at first glance and requires us being very conservative about what cards we let players fetch.</p>

<p><strong>Versatility: Rigid</strong></p>

<p>With Lessons, we must be very conscious of the environment they're being played in. You want to make sure the things you're fetching make sense in the larger context of the structure of the set, including which subset of things you're looking for and how the rest of the set cares about that thing. Fetching instants and sorceries, for example, worked well in <em>Strixhaven: School of Mages</em> because it was a set all about playing them.</p>

<p><strong>Development/Play Design: Neutral</strong></p>

<p>Andrew said that Lessons and learn spells were not as difficult to design as they were time-consuming. You have total control over what's fetchable, but there's a lot of number wrangling.</p>

<p><strong>Playability: Playability Affected</strong></p>

<p>There's a logistical issue because you must monitor cards that aren't in your deck.</p>

<p><strong>Storm Scale: 6</strong></p>

<p>I assume we'll do Lessons and spells with learn again, or something similar, but we need to find the right set where it makes sense.</p>

<h2>Magecraft (<em>Strixhaven</em>)</h2>

<p><magic-card>Archmage Emeritus</magic-card><magic-card>Professor Onyx</magic-card><magic-card>Storm-Kiln Artist</magic-card></p>

<p><strong>Popularity: Popular</strong></p>

<p>Magecraft was well liked, as was the instant and sorcery theme of <em>Strixhaven</em>. Only the Mystical Archive scored higher.</p>

<p><strong>Design Space: Medium</strong></p>

<p>We mostly design magecraft to go on permanents, and it needs effects that are generally useful when you'd cast an instant, which can limit some options. It's also the type of mechanic where there are a lot of nuances in designs that play well. That said, there are plenty more magecraft cards to be designed.</p>

<p><strong>Versatility: Neutral</strong></p>

<p>Magecraft can work in any set, but ideally, we would want it to be in one where there are more instants and sorceries than normal. Also, the mechanic cares about copying, so extra copy effects are also a nice thing to have.</p>

<p><strong>Development/Play Design: Not Problematic</strong></p>

<p>Magecraft is what we call an A/B mechanic (that is, two different elements that have to be combined together, in this case, A is magecraft and B is instants and sorceries). A/B mechanics are a bit easier to balance because play design has control over the volume of each component.</p>

<p><strong>Playability: Playability Not Affected</strong></p>

<p>Magecraft needs you to monitor when instants or sorceries are cast or copied, but that's not too tough of a thing to care about.</p>

<p><strong>Storm Scale: 5</strong></p>

<p>Magecraft needs the right environment to shine but is popular, has a lot of design space, and is easy to balance, so I expect it to return.</p>

<h2>Mystical Archive and Bonus Sheets (<em>Time Spiral</em> block, <em>Strixhaven</em>, <em>Modern Horizons 2</em>, and <em>The Brothers' War</em>)</h2>

<p><magic-card mvid="517593">Mizzix's Mastery</magic-card><magic-card mvid="517577">Demonic Tutor</magic-card><magic-card mvid="517586">Chaos Warp</magic-card></p>

<p><strong>Popularity: Very Popular</strong></p>

<p>Bonus sheets, in general, have always been a fan favorite, and the Mystical Archive particularly was the runaway hit from <em>Strixhaven</em>. Bringing back popular reprints is always a recipe for success.</p>

<p><strong>Design Space: Medium</strong></p>

<p>If all we had to do was reprint any old card, there would be plenty of cards to choose from, but bonus sheets want popular cards from the past, so that greatly lessens the available card pool. Still, there are a lot of cards players want us to reprint, especially with new art and/or frame treatments.</p>

<p><strong>Versatility: Neutral</strong></p>

<p>One of the things R&amp;D cares about is that a bonus sheet is integral to the set it's included in. Some sets have themes that make that easy, while others have themes that make it much more difficult. Also, we must be careful how often we do bonus sheets because reprints are a resource, used in many different products, that we have to carefully dole out.</p>

<p><strong>Development/Play Design: Not Problematic</strong></p>

<p>Andrew said that as long as there are extra cards available allowing them to kick out problematic cards, play design doesn't have a huge issue with bonus sheets. The biggest impact, one you can see in <em>Strixhaven </em>and <em>The Brothers' War</em>, is making the bonus sheet an integral part of the Limited environment. That's the element that takes the most time to balance properly.</p>

<p><strong>Playability: Playability Not Affected</strong></p>

<p>Bonus sheets sometimes use mechanics that don't show up in the rest of the set, so there can be a little extra complication and/or rules issues, but other than that, they're straightforward.</p>

<p><strong>Storm Scale: 4</strong></p>

<p>The popularity of bonus sheets means I expect us to repeatedly use them, although judiciously, in the future.</p>

<h2>"The Storm Has Passed"</h2>

<p>It took two columns, but that's the Storm Scale for <em>Throne of Eldraine</em>, <em>Ikoria: Lair of Behemoths</em>, <em>Zendikar Rising</em>, <em>Kaldheim</em>, and <em>Strixhaven: School of Mages</em>. I get a lot of requests for Storm Scale articles, so I hope you all enjoyed it. As always, I'm eager to hear your feedback about today's column and any of my ratings.

<p>Midweek <em>Magic </em>began as FNM at Home in March of 2020, developed to keep the fun of Friday Night <em>Magic</em> events alive when players couldn't visit their local game stores. Thankfully, in-store play slowly resumed in many locations, and Friday Night <em>Magic</em> returned.</p>
<p>We didn't want to lose the fun and community around FNM at Home, so we updated our FNM at Home event to take place from Tuesdays to Thursdays and renamed it Midweek <em>Magic</em>. Now, you can enjoy <em>Magic </em>during the week on <em>MTG Arena</em> and then connect with your friends at your local game store for fun, in-person Friday Night <em>Magic</em> events, too!</p>

<p>Tabletop tournament legality has long been determined by the global release date. However, there has often been a tension between players receiving cards during Prerelease events and not being able to play them in sanctioned events until a week later. Additionally, digital play has not made any distinction between when cards are available and when they're tournament legal for some time.</p>

<p>So, we're going to make things simple: once you have your cards, you can play them!</p>

<p>Officially, this means that tabletop tournament legality is tied to Prerelease and that <em>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</em> cards will be legal for play in all formats starting February 3.</p>

<p>If that piques your interest any more on <em>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</em>, you can get your <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/a-first-look-at-phyrexia-all-will-be-one" target="_blank">first look at cards and more now</a>, and then tune in on January 17 at 9 a.m. PT at <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/magic" target="_blank">twitch.tv/magic</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@mtg" target="_blank">youtube.com/@mtg</a> (the official <em>Magic</em> YouTube channel) when we kick off previews in full!</p>

I named it the Storm Scale after the mechanic storm, which I felt was unlikely to return to Standard. The scale became popular enough that I've done several Storm Scale articles for "Making <em>Magic</em>":</p>

</ul>

<p>In this column, I look back at the mechanics from two years' worth of premier sets: <em>Throne of Eldraine</em>, <em>Ikoria: Lair of Behemoths</em>, <em>Zendikar Rising</em>, <em>Kaldheim</em>, and <em>Strixhaven: School of Mages</em> (I left out <em>Theros Beyond Death</em> as I'd already done it in <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/making-magic/storm-scale-theros-and-theros-beyond-death-2020-12-07" target="_blank">a previous Storm Scale article</a>). The Storm Scale is a scale from 1 to 10, with 1 meaning the mechanical item is very likely to return and 10 meaning the item is very unlikely to return. Here's what each point means on the scale:</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Level 1: Will definitely see again, most likely in the next set</strong></p>

<p>Examples: flying, deathtouch, scry</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Level 2: Will definitely see again, but not necessarily right away</strong></p>

<p>Examples: cantrips, hybrid mana, double-faced cards</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Level 3: Will most likely do again, probably many times</strong></p>

<p>Examples: cycling, flashback, landfall</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Level 4: Will most likely do again, but they have issues that make them less of a guarantee</strong></p>

<p>Examples: morph, convoke, exalted</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Level 5: We need to find the right place to bring it back, but I'm optimistic</strong></p>

<p>Examples: evolve, monstrous, morbid</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Level 6: We need to find the right place to bring it back, but I'm a little less optimistic</strong></p>

<p>Examples: devour, ninjutsu, living weapon</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Level 7: It's unlikely to return, but possible if the right environment comes along</strong></p>

<p>Examples: snow mana, retrace, split second</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Level 8: It's unlikely to return, but possible if the stars align</strong></p>

<p>Examples: madness, echo, suspend</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Level 9: I never say never, but this would require a minor miracle</strong></p>

<p>Examples: phasing, threshold, clash</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Level 10: I never say never, but this would require a major miracle</strong></p>

<p>Examples: storm, dredge</p>

<hr />
<p>Next, here are the five criteria I use to determine where mechanics fall on the Storm Scale:</p>

<p><strong>Popularity</strong> – Did players like this mechanic? The more players like something, the more likely we are to bring it back. The less they like it, the less likely its return. This metric is mostly covering the "was it fun?" question. This lens will have one of four potential labels:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Very Popular</strong> – This means that through our market research, this mechanic falls in the top 25% of mechanics of all time. Note that all these categories are comparing the current mechanics against the mechanics of all time (well, since we started doing market research many years ago), so getting in this top section is difficult.</li>
	<li><strong>Popular</strong> – This means that through our marketing research, this mechanic falls above the average but not in the top 25%.</li>
	<li><strong>Liked</strong> – This means that through our research, this mechanic falls below average but not in the bottom 25%. I should note that we aim for our average to be well liked, so being below average doesn't mean most players don't like it, just that there are other mechanics they like more. Being in this category doesn't stop things from having a chance to return.</li>
	<li><strong>Unpopular</strong> – This means that our research puts this mechanic in the bottom 25%. Falling in this last section does decrease the chance of a return.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Design Space</strong> – How many more cards could we design with this mechanic? Design space is important because if we can't make more cards, it doesn't matter how much players like it or how easy it is for development to balance. This lens will have three labels:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Large</strong> – This means that this mechanic has lots and lots of design space. We can bring it back again and again and most likely won't have any issues making new cards.</li>
	<li><strong>Medium</strong> – This means that this mechanic has a decent amount of design space and we could easily bring it back, but possibly a limited number of times.</li>
	<li><strong>Small</strong> – This mechanic is pushing the boundaries of its design space in this set. It would be difficult to make enough new cards to bring it back.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Versatility</strong> – How well does this mechanic mix and match with other mechanics? Does this mechanic require a lot of infrastructure or does it require minimal support? In short, does this mechanic make design easier or harder? This lens has three labels:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Flexible</strong> – This mechanic is easy to use, requires minimal support, and interconnects easily with other mechanics.</li>
	<li><strong>Neutral</strong> – This mechanic is a bit harder to use, often requires some support, and/or has issues when connecting to other mechanics.</li>
	<li><strong>Rigid</strong> – This mechanic is very hard to use, requires extensive infrastructure to work, and/or is actively hostile when trying to mix with other mechanics.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Development/Play Design</strong> – How easy is this mechanic to cost? How easy is it to balance? How easy is it to make this mechanic? This lens looks at whether the mechanic can be easily developed and balanced. This lens has three labels:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Not Problematic</strong> – Easy to develop. No major challenges for play design to overcome.</li>
	<li><strong>Neutral</strong> – There are challenges in play design that require special care in testing and development. Most mechanics fall into this category.</li>
	<li><strong>Problematic</strong> – There are major challenges in play design. It may cause us to pull back on the theme, erring on the side of less impact in Constructed.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Playability</strong> – Did players have problems understanding this mechanic, both in how it worked and how it interacted with other mechanics? Was the mechanic logistically hard to use? Did it have memory issues? Does it require a play aide? This lens looks at whether the mechanic had some barrier that made it harder to play. This lens has two labels:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Playability Not Affected</strong> – This means the mechanic had no issues interfering with playing it.</li>
	<li><strong>Playability Affected</strong> – This means the mechanic had one or more issues that interfered with playing it.</li>
</ul>

<p>As always, I want to stress that the Storm Scale is just my opinion and done for fun and I don't use any advanced knowledge in predicting things. For example, I might know we're doing mechanic X in two years, but I'm predicting not using that information as a certainty.</p>

<p>With that explained, it's time to start grading mechanics.</p>

<hr />
<h2><strong>Adamant (<em>Throne of Eldraine</em>)</strong></h2>

<p class="rtecenter"><magic-card>Rally for the Throne</magic-card><magic-card>Foreboding Fruit</magic-card><magic-card>Once and Future</magic-card></p>

<p><strong>Popularity: Unliked</strong></p>

<p>Adamant was just barely in the bottom fourth, but I would say more that people aren't bothered by it as much as they like it. It was a workhorse mechanic that mattered a little in Limited and almost not at all in Constructed. I don't think it would upset most players if it returned, but very few are eager for it. Only a handful of players have ever asked for its return.</p>

<p><strong>Design Space: Medium</strong></p>

<p>This is one of those mechanics that seems to have more design space than it does, not because you couldn't make cards with it, but it's a bit trickier to make cards that will play well with it. Also, it has a challenging "delta." That's the term R&amp;D uses to talk about the power level difference between the two states of a card. Because adamant is a bit harder to do, it gets a larger delta, and there's a little less design space for larger deltas. It's fine if the effect has a number but trickier when it's not number based.</p>

<p><strong>Versatility: Neutral</strong></p>

<p>The mechanic would only go in a set with a monocolor theme, which isn't something we do a lot. That said, the mechanic doesn't require much beyond having a mana base that supports it, which is less of an ask than many other mechanics.</p>

<p><strong>Development/Play Design: Neutral</strong></p>

<p>For all my answers in this category today, I talked with Andrew Brown, who's in charge of the Play Design team. Andrew said that adamant had three challenges. One, you must have the mana bases correct to test it properly. Monocolor themes are harder on mana needs than you might think at first blush. Two, it's a lot trickier to make cards with adamant work in decks with more than one color. Three, it's hard to balance because of the higher deltas.</p>

<p><strong>Playability: Playability Not Affected</strong></p>

<p>There are no rules issues, memory issues, logistics issues, and outside play aides required.</p>

<p><strong>Storm Scale: 7</strong></p>

<p>The biggest strike against this mechanic is that it just doesn't have that many fans. It has a few challenges, but nothing we couldn't do if we wanted. The best chance for this to return is a set with a monocolor theme where it just exactly fills the roll we need.</p>

<hr />
<h2><strong>Adventures (<em>Throne of Eldraine </em>and<em> Commander Legends: Battle for Baldur's Gate</em>)</strong></h2>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Brazen Borrower" src="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=473001&type=card" /> <img alt="Murderous Rider" src="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=473059&type=card" /> <img alt="Bonecrusher Giant" src="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=567598&type=card" /></p>

<p><strong>Popularity: Very Popular</strong></p>

<p>Adventure is one of the best rated mechanics of all time. Players absolutely adore it. (In general, cards that are basically two spells are well liked.)</p>

<p><strong>Design Space: Large</strong></p>

<p>Adventure is a very open-ended mechanic design-wise. <em>Throne of Eldraine</em> only put it on creatures, but as <em>Battle for Baldur's Gate</em> demonstrated, it can go on any permanent. The best adventurer cards tell a fun story, but there are many different types of stories you can tell. The biggest restriction design-wise is that you don't have a lot of rules text, especially for the Adventure spell itself.</p>

<p><strong>Versatility: Neutral</strong></p>

<p>You could just throw an adventurer card in any set, but if you want to make them more integral to the design, it requires a little bit of structural support, often with cards that call out Adventures by name.</p>

<p><strong>Development/Play Design: Neutral</strong></p>

<p>Andrew says the balancing of adventurer cards is more time-consuming than difficult. There are plenty of numbers to play with (the mechanic has a lot of what we call "knobs," things that can be adjusted to balance a card, usually numbers). The biggest challenge during play design is the same one we have during vision design and set design, there's just not a lot of rules-text space, meaning there's less flexibility in how to tweak an effect.</p>

<p><strong>Playability: Playability Not Affected</strong></p>

<p>Adventures come with a little bit of rules baggage, but luckily things that don't come up too often. It doesn't require any play aides but can have a little bit of a memory issue in that you have to remember that the spell is in exile and can be cast. This is on the line, but I've dubbed it "not affected."</p>

<p><strong>Storm Scale: 3</strong></p>

<p>This is a home run mechanic that the players adore. Yes, it comes with a little bit of work on the design side, but nothing we can't handle. This is a mechanic I expect to keep returning.</p>

<hr />
<h2><strong>Food Tokens (<em>Throne of Eldraine</em>, <em>Commander (2021 Edition)</em>, <em>Modern Horizons 2</em>, <em>Streets of New Capenna</em>, and <em>Unfinity</em>)</strong></h2>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Food token" src="https://media.wizards.com/2019/eld/en_8MSslzedLY.png" /> <img alt="Food token" src="https://media.wizards.com/2019/eld/en_zSLS0TURcJ.png" /> <img alt="Food token" src="https://media.wizards.com/2019/eld/en_4OwNtoBgbf.png" /></p>

<p><strong>Popularity: Liked</strong></p>

<p>Food tokens fall just below the line between the top half and the bottom half of the ratings. Players seem to like the flavor of the token, but it's not something players seem to adore or loathe.</p>

<p><strong>Design Space: Large</strong></p>

<p>Artifact tokens are easy to design as they can be the byproduct of many different things. Food tokens want to be as flavorful as possible (pun, as always, intended), which makes their design a little more challenging but doesn't really cut off design space.</p>

<p><strong>Versatility: Flexible</strong></p>

<p>Life gain is about as universal as things come, so it's never hard to make Food tokens matter.</p>

<p><strong>Development/Play Design: Neutral</strong></p>

<p>Life gain can slow down gameplay if not carefully used, so Play Design must ensure that it's not just about adding life to the game. This usually means ensuring there are other ways to make use of Food tokens, which creates difficulties for Play Design. The more you have in the set, the trickier it is to balance.</p>

<p><strong>Playability: Playability Affected</strong></p>

<p>Food tokens are tokens, so the player must find a way to represent them. They're straightforward other than that, though.</p>

<p><strong>Storm Scale: 2</strong></p>

<p>Food tokens are so flavorful (again, pun intended) that they're very easy to want to include in many sets. We've made them deciduous, so I expect to see them a lot in the future. I should note that the token cost (having to make a token that will appear in the set, and all the mind space that comes along with having a noncreature token) will make us think twice before including it, so it's not something I think will show up too frequently.</p>

<hr />
<h2><strong>Companion (<em>Ikoria: Lair of Behemoths</em>)</strong></h2>

<p class="rtecenter"><magic-card>Yorion, Sky Nomad</magic-card><magic-card>Jegantha, the Wellspring</magic-card><magic-card>Lurrus of the Dream-Den</magic-card></p>

<p><strong>Popularity: Unpopular</strong></p>

<p>Companion has one of the lowest rankings of any mechanic since we started doing ratings. Part of this was that we made a huge mistake balancing them and they were causing problems across almost all Constructed formats.</p>

<p><strong>Design Space: Small</strong></p>

<p>Companions require effects that are interesting to build around while being something the opponent can monitor to make sure you're following the limitation. We made ten in <em>Ikoria</em> and were already running out of available space, so I'm dubious how much space remains for this mechanic.</p>

<p><strong>Versatility: Neutral</strong></p>

<p>Companions don't have a lot of structural needs (i.e., you could just throw one in any set), but usually you want to make sure that what you're asking for has some support in the set, especially if you do some at uncommon, which will impact Limited.</p>

<p><strong>Development/Play Design: Problematic</strong></p>

<p>Never have we needed to revise an entire mechanic for power-level concerns, so that's a pretty good indication that this is a troublesome mechanic. Andrew has two main concerns about the mechanic: one, the real world has much better deck-building efficiency because there are millions of players, and two, the mechanic has so many variables to monitor. It's one of the hardest mechanics we've ever made to properly balance.</p>

<p><strong>Playability: Playability Affected</strong></p>

<p>There are rules issues, memory issues, logistical issues. It makes the opponent feel they must carefully monitor what's in the other player's deck. It's a mechanic with a lot of baggage.</p>

<p><strong>Storm Scale: 9</strong></p>

<p>I should probably give companion a 10. It's unpopular, has little design space, and is hard to balance, but it's a mechanic that I get asked about a lot (I believe the ratings don't totally reflect the public's interest), and I'd like to believe if the perfect opportunity arose, we'd at least think about it.</p>

<hr />
<h2><strong>Cycling (<em>Urza's Saga</em> block,<em> Onslaught </em>block, <em>Time Spiral</em> block, <em>Shards of Alara</em> block, <em>Amonkhet </em>block, <em>Modern Horizons</em>, <em>Ikoria</em>, and <em>Streets of New Capenna</em>)</strong></h2>

<p class="rtecenter"><magic-card>Shark Typhoon</magic-card><magic-card mvid="479661">Yidaro, Wandering Monster</magic-card><magic-card>Ketria Triome</magic-card></p>

<p><strong>Popularity: Popular</strong></p>

<p>Cycling is a beloved mechanic that has dropped over time in our ratings, not because players don't like it but because it's become familiar. It's no longer the sexy, new thing. Players are always happy to see it, though. This is a good place to point out that market research is a good tool to get a general sense of a mechanic, but there are issues that affect it that aren't indicative of whether players enjoy it.</p>

<p><strong>Design Space: Large</strong></p>

<p>Cycling has about as big of a design space as they come. It can go on any card type and can be tweaked a lot. I never worry about our ability to design new cycling cards.</p>

<p><strong>Versatility: Flexible</strong></p>

<p>A set could have just one cycling card or a whole theme for players to build around. The designers love cycling as it's very useful and can be added to just about any design.</p>

<p><strong>Development/Play Design: Neutral</strong></p>

<p>The experiment with a bunch of cycling 1 cards in <em>Ikoria</em> showed that there are ways to cause balance problems with cycling. The good news is that because we've used it so often, we have a pretty good understanding of how it interacts with other game elements.</p>

<p><strong>Playability: Playability Not Affected</strong></p>

<p>No major rules issues, no memory issues, no logistical issues, no play aides required. Cycling is easy to use.</p>

<p><strong>Storm Scale: 3</strong></p>

<p>As of <em>Streets of New Capenna</em>, cycling has become deciduous. I thought about moving it to 2, which is where most of the deciduous things live, but I decided to keep the deciduous named keyword/ability word mechanics at 3 as I don't think we use them on average quite as often as what I'll call the design tools.</p>

<hr />
<h2><strong>Mutate (<em>Ikoria</em>)</strong></h2>

<p class="rtecenter"><magic-card>Sea-Dasher Octopus</magic-card><magic-card>Gemrazer</magic-card><magic-card mvid="479717">Nethroi, Apex of Death</magic-card></p>

<p><strong>Popularity: Liked</strong></p>

<p>Mutate is very polarizing. The players who like it adore it, but there are a lot of players who simply aren't fans (probably because it's a complicated mechanic with odd rules interactions).</p>

<p><strong>Design Space: Medium</strong></p>

<p>Mutate is a good example of a mechanic with a lot of potential but far less that would lead to good gameplay. It does have a big enough design space that a future set could take it in a bit of a different direction.</p>

<p><strong>Versatility: Rigid</strong></p>

<p>You can't just throw one mutate card in a set. It requires a significant amount of infrastructure, and you have to care how all the mutate cards interact with the non-mutate cards.</p>

<p><strong>Development/Play Design: Neutral</strong></p>

<p>This was the one mechanic I was most surprised that Andrew didn't label it "problematic." He said that the biggest issue with making mutate cards isn't doing it within the "biosphere" of its Limited environment (that wasn't as hard as I had assumed) but getting it to interact with everything around it in sets that weren't designed with mutate in mind. The other big issue is that mutate is a bit of a rules nightmare, which can cause all sorts of weird interactions (which, of course, is tied to the difficulty of making it work with cards from other sets).</p>

<p><strong>Playability: Playability Affected</strong></p>

<p>Mutate is in contention for the most complex mechanic rules-wise we've ever made. A lot of players don't like it because they simply don't understand how it works in many practical situations.</p>

<p><strong>Storm Scale: 7</strong></p>

<p>This probably should be a little higher as it's a hard mechanic to wrangle, but it's a mechanic that's beloved by its fans, and it's something I'm asked about all the time. So, I'm eager to find a home for it but am aware that it's not going to be an easy thing to do (outside of a return to Ikoria).</p>

<hr />
<h2><strong>Kicker (<em>Invasion</em> block, <em>Time Spiral</em> block, <em>Zendikar</em> block, <em>Dominaria</em>, <em>Modern Horizons</em>, <em>Modern Horizons 2</em>, <em>Zendikar Rising</em>, and <em>Dominaria United</em>)</strong></h2>

<p class="rtecenter"><magic-card>Maddening Cacophony</magic-card><magic-card>Scourge of the Skyclaves</magic-card><magic-card>Skyclave Relic</magic-card></p>

<p><strong>Popularity: Liked</strong></p>

<p>Kicker, much like cycling, has gone down in our ratings over time, but more for familiarity reasons than for any dislike of the mechanic.</p>

<p><strong>Design Space: Large</strong></p>

<p>Kicker has a humongous design space, larger than I assume <em>Magic</em> could ever do. It can go on any card type and has a lot of utility. My biggest issue with kicker is not what it can do but that we design it such that it doesn't step on the toes of other mechanics. I've talked at length in other columns and podcasts that with 20/20 hindsight, we might not have done kicker so broadly as a mechanic but chopped it up more so new mechanics didn't get the "that's just kicker" response for the audience.</p>

<p><strong>Versatility: Flexible</strong></p>

<p>You could have one kicker card in a set, or you could build themes around it. Kicker is as flexible a mechanic as they come.</p>

<p><strong>Development/Play Design: Not Problematic</strong></p>

<p>To quote Andrew: "It's easy. It's kicker."</p>

<p><strong>Playability: Playability Not Affected</strong></p>

<p>Kicker has no rules issues, no memory issues, no logistical issues, no play-aide issues. It's easy. It's kicker.</p>

<p><strong>Storm Scale: 3</strong></p>

<p>Kicker is easy to use and plays great. We will use it again and again.</p>

<hr />
<h2><strong>Landfall (<em>Zendikar</em> block, <em>Battle for Zendikar</em> block, and <em>Zendikar </em>Rising)</strong></h2>

<p class="rtecenter"><magic-card>Moraug, Fury of Akoum</magic-card><magic-card>Nissa of Shadowed Boughs</magic-card><magic-card>Omnath, Locus of Creation</magic-card></p>

<p><strong>Popularity: Liked</strong></p>

<p>This is basically the same thing I said for cycling and kicker. Landfall was super popular when it premiered and is still well liked but slowly slipped down in rating as players have become more familiar with it. (I should note that its initial rating is up there with the best of all time.)</p>

<p><strong>Design Space: Large</strong></p>

<p>Okay, nowhere near as big as either cycling or kicker, but still big. It can go on every card type (although we've yet to do it on sorceries), but it works best on permanents.</p>

<p><strong>Versatility: Neutral</strong></p>

<p>Here's where landfall differs from cycling and kicker. It requires a bit more structural support. Usually, a set with landfall will add a few extra ways to trigger landfall. Also, the focus on playing lands has ripples on other parts of the design. For instance, it tends to lead to more mana, which makes you want more mana sinks than normal.</p>

<p><strong>Development/Play Design: Not Problematic</strong></p>

<p>We've spent a lot of time making landfall cards, so Play Design understands the nooks and crannies of how it interacts with other cards.</p>

<p><strong>Playability: Playability Not Affected</strong></p>

<p>It does require an extra attention to lands being played, so I had to think about how to grade this. Luckily, it's not something that's hard to pay attention to.</p>

<p><strong>Storm Scale: 3</strong></p>

<p>Landfall has also been upgraded to deciduous status, but I decided to keep deciduous named keywords/ability words at 3.</p>

<p>Welcome to <em>Dominaria Remastered</em> preview week. Today, I'm going to talk a little bit about the history of remastered sets. I'll walk you through the design of <em>Dominaria Remastered</em> specifically. Finally, I'll show off a preview card from the set. It's not a new card, as the set is all reprints, but it does have cool new art.</p>

<h2>Everything Old Is New Again</h2>

<p>Our story begins back in 2014. <em>Magic Online</em> was looking for more content, but they were trying to do so without making new cards. Was there a way to make new content out of existing cards? That's when the idea of a remastered set was first thought up. When <em>Magic</em> premiered in 1993, Limited play wasn't something that was thought about when building a set. Yes, there was some Limited play (mostly Sealed in the early days), but it was an afterthought, and the sets weren't designed with Limited in mind. This meant that most Limited play was not the greatest play experience.</p>

<p>Take <em>Legends </em>as an example. There was one red common creature in <em>Legends</em> capable of attacking for any amount of damage (<auto-card>Raging Bull</auto-card> was a 2/2), and the only way to destroy an opponent's non-world enchantment required you to bounce all your enchantments to your hand. <em>Ice Age</em> had a different problem where you could open all your boosters and not have enough creatures to fill out your deck. I had numerous <em>Ice Age</em> games where I opened my boosters and said, "I don't think I can make a deck capable of dealing 20 damage to my opponent."</p>

<p>Starting with <em>Mirage</em>, R&amp;D began thinking about Limited, but it was a steep learning curve and it took many years to figure out much of the staples of modern-day design in regards to Limited play. This meant there were a lot of early sets that didn't play up to modern standards for Limited. Was there a way to use an old card pool but apply modern design techniques to it? That was the idea behind a remastered set. You would take a pool of cards larger than a normal set and craft from them a draft environment. This was done by handpicking which cards you wanted, sometimes changing rarity. The initial idea was that you would pick a single block because you would get three sets all in the same locale using the same mechanics and themes. With three sets to choose from, you could fine-tune your themes and reconfigure the set to have a more modern approach.</p>

<p>The first set to get a remastered treatment was <em>Tempest</em>. (<em>Tempest</em> is near and dear to my heart as it was the first set I ever led and the one that helped me become a <em>Magic </em>designer.) The design team took all three sets from the <em>Tempest</em> block (<em>Tempest</em>, <em>Stronghold</em>, and <em>Exodus</em>) and from them crafted a single set. This was released on <em>Magic Online</em> in 2015. The response was quite positive. <em>Magic: The Gathering Arena</em> would then do remastered versions of both the <em>Kaladesh</em> and <em>Amonkhet</em> blocks in 2020. (The cards had already been coded for the beta playtest, so it didn't require any new coding.) Finally, in 2021, the first remastered set was made for tabletop with <em>Time Spiral Remastered</em>. <em>Time Spiral</em>, as a block, was more adventuresome than most and had access to a <em>lot</em> of mechanics. (No seriously, there were more mechanics in the block than had preexisted in all of <em>Magic</em> before the block.)</p>

<p>Which brings us to Mark Globus. Mark came in fourth in the first <em>Great Designer Search</em>. That led to a job in R&amp;D. Mark would eventually become a producer and ended up overseeing several products, including the development of the first Commander product and co-leading the design and development of the first <em>Modern Horizons</em>. For regular readers of this column, you might recognize him as part of the Council of Marks that helped to get <em>Unstable</em> made. Today's story begins shortly after Mark left Wizards of the Coast after working for many years in R&amp;D to pursue other interests. On his way out, he expressed a desire to do some freelance design work.</p>

<p>Mark was given the following freelance assignment. R&amp;D wanted to do more remastered sets. Which ones did he think were most viable? Mark went through all of <em>Magic</em>'s sets and made a list of all the possible remastered sets he could foresee, from most viable to least viable. Some of these sets took existing blocks like the past remastered sets had done, but he also looked at other themes that might allow us to approach a remastered set in different ways. Three potential remastered sets were chosen from that list (I assume from the top of the list) for Mark to work on. <em>Dominaria Remastered</em> is the first of the three to see print. Mark was aided in his design by Ben Lundquist, a play designer in Studio X.</p>

<h2>Remaster of the Universe</h2>

<p>The further back you go, the rougher the design of the sets are for Limited play. For example, the idea of Limited archetypes tied to color combinations is a product of the last fifteen years, meaning the first half of <em>Magic</em> didn't purposefully build it in. Some sets ended up doing something roughly in that vein but not structured in the way we do them now. This makes using a lot of early sets for remastered sets a bit tricky. Mark came up with an interesting solution for this problem. What if we themed a remastered set around the plane of Dominaria? Most early sets took place there, so the set would have access to a far larger card pool than normal.</p>

<p>Here's the list of every set that takes place on (or primarily takes place on) Dominaria, 27 in all (for all the Vorthoses out there, <em>Tempest</em>, <em>Stronghold</em>, <em>Exodus</em>, and <em>Nemesis</em> take place on the plane of Rath, which would later be overlaid onto Dominaria, but we chose not to include them here because they didn't take place on Dominaria at the time and the first three had already been used in <em>Tempest Remastered</em>):</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>Alpha</em></li>
	<li><em>Antiquities</em></li>
	<li><em>Legends</em></li>
	<li><em>The Dark</em></li>
	<li><em>Fallen Empires</em></li>
	<li><em>Ice Age</em></li>
	<li><em>Alliances</em></li>
	<li><em>Cold Snap</em></li>
	<li><em>Mirage</em></li>
	<li><em>Visions</em></li>
	<li><em>Weatherlight</em></li>
	<li><em>Urza's Saga</em></li>
	<li><em>Urza's Legacy</em></li>
	<li><em>Urza's Destiny</em></li>
	<li><em>Invasion</em></li>
	<li><em>Planeshift</em></li>
	<li><em>Apocalypse</em></li>
	<li><em>Prophecy</em></li>
	<li><em>Odyssey</em></li>
	<li><em>Torment</em></li>
	<li><em>Judgement</em></li>
	<li><em>Onslaught</em></li>
	<li><em>Legions</em></li>
	<li><em>Scourge</em></li>
	<li><em>Time Spiral</em></li>
	<li><em>Planar Chaos</em></li>
	<li><em>Future Sight</em></li>
	<li><em>Dominaria</em></li>
</ul>

<p>This list is significantly longer than what we use for most remastered sets, but since its themes were going to be more built from scratch rather than just following what the set did originally, it was going to need access to a lot more cards. Here's how Mark and Ben built the set. They started by looking at all the available sets and choosing what cards were possible inclusions. Here are some reasons a card might not make the cut:</p>

<p><strong>1) It's too weak.</strong></p>

<p><em>Magic</em> took a while to get a good sense of power level, especially with creatures, so a lot of cards just weren't up to the power level one would expect for a modern Limited experience. This was the category that led to the most cuts.</p>

<p><strong>2) It's too strong.</strong></p>

<p>Part of missing the power level also meant occasionally missing high, especially when it comes to Limited. Past <em>Magic</em> sets, especially earlier ones, have cards that warped the Limited environment, and those were often removed from consideration. Changing rarities was a possibility, so some strong commons and uncommons could be upshifted in rarity assuming they weren't too swingy.</p>

<p><strong>3) It's out of color pie.</strong></p>

<p>We do allow reprints of cards out of color pie provided the printing doesn't introduce them to a new format (meaning there are a bunch in <em>Dominaria Remastered</em>), but when you're playing into familiar themes, you must be careful with color-pie breaks, as they can imply things when drafted that aren't true for the rest of the set.</p>

<p><strong>4) It's too narrow.</strong></p>

<p>There are a lot of cards, especially in the early days, that have functions that just don't come up in Limited situations (and often not in Constructed situations either). A bunch of cards were cut because they just didn't contribute to the larger Limited environment and weren't relevant to any Constructed formats.</p>

<p><strong>5) It's too misleading.</strong></p>

<p>In Draft, R&amp;D has something we call a "trap," where it hints to the drafter that there's a theme to draft that isn't supported in the set. We allow some of that at high rarities if the card is relevant for Constructed formats, but we are extra careful about it at common and uncommon. When picking cards from the past, the design team had to be conscious of cards that deviated too far from the norm of the rest of the cards in that color.</p>

<p>After this pass, they looked at their pool to see if they could find mechanical themes that naturally existed in the different color pairs. <em>Magic</em>'s colors have been somewhat mechanically consistent over the years. In addition, they wanted to have multicolor signpost cards at uncommon, so they looked through the multicolor cards to see what themes they encouraged.</p>

<p>Back in the day, we purposefully withheld multicolor from a lot of sets, so the multicolor pool to choose from was smaller than you might assume. They did find themes, but due to the nature of the card pool, they had to be a little lighter in touch than we tend to do in modern sets.</p>

<p>To adjust for this, Mark and Ben found small clusters of cards that worked well together to weave through the set. This meant that sometimes while looking for a certain theme, they might get pulled a little in a different direction by cards that were synergistic with one another. These synergistic clusters are one of the most fun things about the card pool and can create neat deviations in Draft.</p>

<p>The design went through several iterations, using playtests to see which themes were coming through and which were fun to play. When the dust settled, here's where the archetypes ended up:</p>

<h3>White-Blue: Flicker</h3>

<p>White and blue have numerous ways to bring a creature onto the battlefield multiple times. They can flicker them (exile and return), they can return them to hand and replay them, they can return them from the graveyard (both to hand and the battlefield), they can copy them, etc. This archetype takes advantage of this by having a lot of enters-the-battlefield effects which it can trigger multiple times. These effects are then used to help you control the game, allowing you to use these same creatures as your win condition.</p>

<h3>Blue-Black: Control</h3>

<p>Blue and black have a lot of tools at their disposal (counterspells, discard, bounce, creature kill, stealing, etc.) to gain card advantage and stay ahead of the opponent. This archetype is a bit slower, but it does a good job of giving the player the effects they need to influence the game in their direction, allowing them to slowly eke out a win over time. Blue-black is very good at winning in a way where the opponent doesn't quite understand how they lost.</p>

<h3>Black-Red: Zombies and Goblins</h3>

<p>Most of the archetypes are just playing in the mechanical space that the two colors most often use in sets. Black-red does something a little different. It takes a popular creature type theme in black, Zombies, and a popular creature type theme in red, Goblins, and finds ways to mash the two together. It turns out Goblins are good at making lots of Goblins and Zombies have the means to sacrifice creatures for advantage. The archetype also makes use of cards specifically with Zombie and Goblin rewards. Finally, several sets had some mono-black Goblins in them (but no mono-red Zombies, sadly).</p>

<h3>Red-Green: Cycling</h3>

<p>It turns out that three different blocks set on Dominaria (the <em>Urza's Saga</em>, <em>Onslaught</em>, and <em>Time Spiral</em> blocks) all made use of the cycling mechanic. (Interestingly, originally designed by Richard Garfield for use in <em>Tempest</em>.) That was more than enough to build a Limited theme out of them. The design team chose red and green, as those are the two best ramping colors. When you draw the cycling cards in the early game, cycle away what you don't need to get the cards to help you ramp, and then when you draw them in the late game, cast them.</p>

<h3>Green-White: Threshold</h3>

<p>The threshold mechanic (which rewards you for having seven or more cards in your graveyard) only appeared in the <em>Odyssey</em> block (<em>Odyssey</em>, <em>Torment</em>, and <em>Judgment</em>), but it works well with green-white's normal go-wide strategy. Some smaller cards will fill up your graveyard, allowing others still on the battlefield to upgrade and overrun your opponent. This was one of the trickiest themes for them to properly balance.</p>

<h3>White-Black: Life Gain and Life Loss</h3>

<p>White and black are both good at gaining life (white through life-gaining spells, black through drain effects, and white and black through creatures with lifelink). This archetype gives you a lot of ways to gain life and other ways to spend it. The archetype is slow and controlling, using your life gain to stall while plinking away at the opponent's life to win the game. This type of deck is often referred to as a "bleeder deck."</p>

<h3>Blue-Red: Storm</h3>

<p>Storm is a keyword mechanic introduced in <em>Scourge </em>and brought back in the <em>Time Spiral</em> block. It plays nicely with blue-red's spell theme (blue and red have the highest percentages of noncreature spells). The archetype uses its spells to gain tempo advantage, often using storm as a finisher. Note that all the storm cards are in red.</p>

<h3>Black-Green: The Rock</h3>

<p>"The rock" is an archetype that's appeared numerous times throughout <em>Magic</em>. It's a midrange archetype that plays a lot of disruption. It keeps putting out creatures that get larger and larger, using its spells to remove obstacles. Its usual finisher is a giant creature.</p>

<h3>Red-White: Auras</h3>

<p>As usual, red-white is an aggro archetype that wins by being aggressive. It makes use of Auras to boost creatures, helping them be as offensive as possible. This is a good example of a theme that was possible because it's something that showed up in almost every set, giving the design team a lot of choices.</p>

<h3>Green-Blue: Ramp</h3>

<p>Blue-green ramp is another time-tested staple archetype. Blue uses its control elements to support green's mana growth, which leads to large spells of both colors getting played in the late game. Because this theme is used so often, there were a lot of cards that helped enable it as an option.</p>

<p>Once Mark and Ben had the themes for the archetypes, they spent a lot of time picking monocolor cards that worked in multiple themes. This would allow the draft to be dynamic. In the wiki on the set, there's a long list for each color of what cards in other colors combo well with that color's themes.</p>

<p>Beyond the Limited concerns, Mark and Ben took a lot of time figuring out which cards would be popular reprints that would excite players interested in different formats. One of the fun things about looking through the file is seeing a lot of favorite cards from the past.</p>

<h2>Remaster of One's Own <em>Destiny</em></h2>

<p>My preview card for today is one I designed in 1997, or around then. I thought I'd show it off and give you a little story about its design.</p>

	<p>My preview card is Urza's Incubator. It has brand-new art for this set. This card was designed for <em>Urza's Destiny</em>, a set for which I was the entire design team. There weren't a lot of full-time <em>Magic</em> R&amp;D designers back then (just six, I believe), and we were making a lot of stuff (okay, not as much as today, but R&amp;D <em>is</em> over eight times the size now), so I was asked if I could handle the design for <em>Urza's Destiny</em> by myself. I said I could. Other than <em>Alpha</em> and <em>Arabian Nights</em> (both done before there was an R&amp;D team), I believe <em>Urza's Destiny</em> is the only <em>Magic</em> set, with new content, created by a design team of one.</p>

	<p>I was a big believer in creature-type themes. Note that this was before I'd pushed hard to make creature types a big part of the<em> Onslaught</em> block, so it was more of a niche theme at the time. I wanted to make a card that enabled creature-type decks, but I only had one slot for it. My solution was to make something generally useful and then let the player decide which creature type they wanted to care about. I figured this would allow one slot to meet the needs of a whole swath of different creature-type decks. I weighed a bunch of different effects but in the end went with something that made spells cheaper. It didn't work quite as well with a few weenie creature types, but at the time, those were the ones that were already playing best.</p>

	<p>This card, originally rare (although to be fair, that was the highest rarity at the time), was moved to mythic rare, as it's more for Constructed than Limited. It's hard to use in Limited, as the set is not designed with a strong creature-type theme (other than the black-red archetype, and even that is a light touch). I'm excited for a new generation of players to get a chance to play it.</p><hr />

Today, I'm going to do the same with Urza's.</p>

<p><strong>Urza, Lord Protector; The Mightstone and Weakstone; and Urza, Planeswalker</strong></p>

<p>As I mentioned last week, <em>Alpha</em> was the first to include Urza's name on cards (on Glasses of Urza and Sunglasses of Urza—apparently, he liked eyewear), but he didn't become a character until <em>Antiquities</em>, where references to the Brothers' War initially appeared. Urza continued to show up in card names until his first appearance in card art from the <em>Urza's Saga</em> block, where he was the protagonist of the story. He then returned in the <em>Invasion</em> block, where he appeared on a creature card for the first time but not with his name. Can you name that creature?</p>

<p>In the story, Urza disguised himself as a blind seer. He wanted to help Gerrard and company, but he didn't want them to know he was Urza. We didn't have planeswalker cards at the time (that wouldn't come until <em>Lorwyn</em> many years later), so this was a way to have him appear as a creature. If you didn't read the novel, though, you'd have no idea this was Urza, even with a tiny tease from the flavor text.</p>

<p>Urza finally got a card with his name on it in <em>Unstable</em>: Urza, Academy Headmaster. In <em>Unhinged</em>, Urza showed up as a head (making fun of a plot point from the <em>Weatherlight</em> Saga story—his head gets chopped off, but he keeps on living as a disembodied head). <em>Unstable</em> had the first-ever <em>Un-</em> planeswalker, a five-color Urza, as that had been a frequent request from the players, and everyone seemed to enjoy Urza's head as a character. (Quick little factoid: Urza's head is one of only a small handful of characters to show up in three different <em>Un-</em> sets.) Urza then showed up as a legendary creature called Urza, Lord High Artificer in <em>Modern Horizons</em> (this portrayed him prior to his spark igniting).</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img alt="Urza's Hot Tub" src="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=74345&amp;type=card" /> <img alt="Urza, Academy Headmaster" src="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=439525&amp;type=card" /> <img alt="Urza, Lord High Artificer" src="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=464024&amp;type=card" style="height:310px;" /></p>

<p>When Ari and I were making the demo decks, we knew that we were going to have a meld Urza where the melded version would be an Urza planeswalker card. One of the challenges of doing planeswalkers from prior to the Mending is capturing a sense of how powerful they were. Urza holds an important place in the story as a character, so we knew a planeswalker card of him had to be a big deal. The hoop to jump through, melding the card, seemed difficult enough that it allowed us the ability to make a very powerful planeswalker. Here's our first take on Urza (note that the young version of Urza would play out as its own card in<em> The Brothers' War</em>):</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Urza, Young Artificer (rare)</strong><br />
2WU<br />
Legendary Creature — Human Artificer<br />
2/4<br />
X, T: Return target artifact card with converted mana cost X from your graveyard to your hand.<br />
At the beginning of combat on your turn, if you control an artifact named Raw Powerstone, you may exile it and CARDNAME and meld them into Urza, Planeswalker.</p>

<p>Urza was an artificer, so we wanted to play that up. A nice simple ability was to let him get artifacts from out of the graveyard, allowing you to cast them again. We wanted it to be harder to get expensive items out of the graveyard, so we put an X in the activation cost. Urza was 2/4 to mirror Mishra, who was 4/2. (Mishra felt like the more aggressive of the two.)</p>

<p>When Urza became a Planeswalker, the Mightstone and Weakstone became his eyes, so that seemed like another opportunity to choose an item that literally merged with the character. Just one small problem. <em>Antiquities </em>already had both the Mightstone and the Weakstone.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img alt="Mightstone" src="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=1011&amp;type=card" /> <img alt="Weakstone" src="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=1034&amp;type=card" /></p>

<p>Sadly, neither card was particularly all that exciting, either from a design or power-level perspective. We talked about just making new ones and forgetting the old ones existed but decided against it. In the demo deck, Ari suggested we just make a mana stone and name it generically as a powerstone. We had the idea to show the Mightstone and Weakstone in the art on the cards. This was before powerstones existed as an artifact token.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Raw Powerstone (uncommon)</strong><br />
3<br />
Artifact<br />
When CARDNAME enters the battlefield, gain 2 life.<br />
T: Add 1.</p>

<p>We wanted the melded version of Urza to be a planeswalker card to reflect his transformation at the end of the story. Also, players have been asking for an Eternal-legal Urza planeswalker card ever since we made a non-Eternal one in <em>Unstable</em> (and that was a result of players asking for an Urza planeswalker card for many years). The obvious choice was to make a planeswalker with a lot of loyalty abilities, more than any previous planeswalker card. I think we chose six, because that's how many could fit (by our best estimation). Here's what we made:</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Urza, Planeswalker</strong><br />
Legendary Planeswalker<br />
Loyalty – 7<br />
+1 – Return up to one target artifact creature from the graveyard to the battlefield.<br />
0 – Make a */* artifact creature token whose power and toughness are equal to the number of artifacts you control.<br />
-1 – Return target noncreature artifact from your graveyard to the battlefield.<br />
-3 – Make an artifact token with "If a source would deal damage to you, prevent 1 of that damage."<br />
-X – Add X to your mana pool. Use this mana only to cast artifact spells or activate artifact abilities.<br />
-10 – Destroy all permanents.</p>

<p>These abilities were a mixed bag. Let's walk through them:</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier">+1 – Return up to one target artifact creature from the graveyard to the battlefield.<br />
-1 – Return target noncreature artifact from your graveyard to the battlefield.</p>

<p>Urza was known for digging up ancient artifacts and figuring out how to make them work again. We split this into two abilities, as we wanted it to be easier to regrow artifact creatures than nonartifact creatures.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier">0 – Make a */* artifact creature token whose power and toughness are equal to the number of artifacts you control.</p>

<p>This is an ability used on multiple Urza-themed cards (Urza, Lord High Artificer and Urza's Saga).</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier">-3 – Make an artifact token with "If a source would deal damage to you, prevent 1 of that damage."</p>

<p>This is a nod to an ability on the card Urza's Armor.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier">-X – Add X to your mana pool. Use this mana only to cast artifact spells or activate artifact abilities.</p>

<p>This is the earliest version of the ability that would eventually become what the powerstone artifact tokens do.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier">-10 – Destroy all permanents.</p>

<p>At the end of the story, Urza used the Golgothian Sylex to blow everything up. This can be seen on cards like Urza's Ruinous Blast. We felt obligated to hit this story point on Urza's card.</p>

<p>The Urza melded planeswalker was probably the biggest hit of the demo decks (although the decks as a whole were well received) and helped green-light <em>The Brothers' War</em> as a premier set.</p>

<p>Now we get to vision design. Here's our first take on Urza, the legendary creature version on the front of one meld card:</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Urza, Lord Protector (version #1)</strong><br />
1WU<br />
Legendary Creature — Human Artificer<br />
2/2<br />
Noncreature spells you cast cost 1 less to cast.<br />
7: If you both own and control CARDNAME and an artifact named OTHERNAME, then first exile them, then meld them into OTHEROTHERNAME.</p>

<p>Interestingly, it's close to the printed version. Noncreature spells were limited a bit, turning into "artifact, instant, and sorcery spells." I believe that change was part power, part flavor. Other than that and a shift from 2/2 to 2/4, the Set Design and Play Design teams were happy with the card as is.</p>

<p>Here's the art description:</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Setting</strong>: The Brothers' War<br />
<strong>Color</strong>: White and blue LEGENDARY creature<br />
<strong>Location</strong>: Atop a RUINED STONE COLOSSUS (inspired by the silhouettes on p.9, the size of an aircraft carrier) on the shore of Argoth (p. 93–95) during Act III (p. 122–125 for guidance).<br />
<strong>Intent</strong>: Urza is the main character of <em>The Brothers' War</em> novel, and one of <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>'s most storied Planeswalkers. This image will show him at the height of his mortal power, prior to his ascendancy; at this moment, he is fighting his brother Mishra at the climax of the novel.<br />
<strong>Action</strong>: Show us URZA (p. 5d for direct reference) FIRING a BEAM OF RED ENERGY from his MIGHTSTONE (p. 5a and 133d for reference) at an enemy off-screen. Urza holds the SYLEX (p. 133a) under his arm, protecting it. We might see a stormy ocean behind him and the spray of waves crashing on the colossus. We might see the sparks of raging forest fires drifting in from off-screen, where he is firing his beam. It looks like the end of the world.<br />
<strong>Focus</strong>: Urza<br />
<strong>Mood</strong>: The final battle, the end of the story</p>

<p>The Vision Design team came up with a solution to the Mightstone and Weakstone problem. While there were cards that represented each of them, there wasn't a card yet that represented the two of them together. Urza did get both powerstones as eyes. Here's where we started:</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>The Mightstone and Weakstone (version #1)</strong><br />
4<br />
Legendary Artifact — Powerstone<br />
T: Add CC. You can't spend this mana to cast spells.<br />
3: Target noncreature artifact becomes a 3/3 artifact creature until end of turn.<br />
3: Target creature gets -3/-0 until end of turn.</p>

<p>The basic structure was here from the beginning. It had three abilities. One that matched whatever the powerstone tokens did. One that captured the Mightstone. One that captured the Weakstone. Let's walk through them.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier">T: Add CC. You can't spend this mana to cast spells.</p>

<p>The reason this taps for CC rather than C is because it's not one but two powerstones. At this point in time, the powerstones didn't let you use the mana to cast spells.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier">3: Target noncreature artifact becomes a 3/3 artifact creature until end of turn.</p>

<p>This activation represents the Mightstone. It's generating resources, in this case a creature. I'm guessing it was a 3/3 to match the activation costs of three. Aesthetics are a powerful thing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier">3: Target creature gets -3/-0 until end of turn.</p>

<p>This activation represents the Weakstone, which makes things weaker. This first version just shrank power.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>The Mightstone and Weakstone (version #2)</strong><br />
4<br />
Legendary Artifact — Powerstone<br />
When CARDNAME enters the battlefield, choose one —<br />
• Create two 1/1 colorless Soldier artifact creature tokens.<br />
• Target creature gets -4/-4 until end of turn.<br />
T: Add CC. This mana can't be spent to cast colored spells. (Melds with Urza, Lord Protector) [Urza, Planeswalker]</p>

<p>The next version had a few small tweaks and one big change. It rearranged the order to have the Mightstone and Weakstone effects come first. It changed the Mightstone effect to making multiple small creatures instead of one bigger creature; it significantly strengthened the Weakstone effect (going from -3/-0 to -4/-4), allowing it to kill creatures; and it changed the powerstone ability to match what the powerstone artifact tokens were doing at that time. The printed version went from 4 to 5 and made the effects even stronger. The Mightstone effect would move away from creating creature tokens and instead draw cards, which is useful for more decks. The Weakstone ability was made to kill more creatures by changing from -4/-4 to -5/-5. The powerstone ability changed again as the powerstone artifact tokens changed.</p>

<p>Here's the art description:</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Setting</strong>: The Brothers' War<br />
<strong>Color</strong>: Colorless artifact<br />
<strong>Location</strong>: On a beach battlefield during Act III<br />
<strong>Action</strong>: Show us the MIGHTSTONE (p. 133d) and the WEAKSTONE (p.133b) SMOKING in a crater of GLASSED DARK SAND. The Mightstone should have a dim, ruby-red glow; the Weakstone should have a dim, emerald-green glow.<br />
<strong>Focus</strong>: The Mightstone and the Weakstone<br />
<strong>Mood</strong>: Artifacts of great power</p>

<p>All that was left was to make the meld planeswalker version of Urza. Because the promo version had gone over so well, we started from there. The first vision design version had six loyalty abilities:</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Urza, Planeswalker (version #1)</strong><br />
Legendary Planeswalker — Urza<br />
Loyalty – 4<br />
+2: Scry 2, then draw a card.<br />
+1: Create a 1/4 colorless Soldier artifact creature token with vigilance.<br />
-2: You get an emblem with "Artifact creatures you control get +1/+1."<br />
-4: Return target artifact card from your graveyard to the battlefield.<br />
-6: Shuffle your library, then exile the top four cards. Until end of turn, you may play those cards without paying their mana costs.<br />
-9: Artifacts you control gain indestructible until end of turn. Destroy all other nonland permanents.</p>

<p>While the structure stayed similar, the effects changed significantly. There was still an artifact creature token maker, but now a 1/4 rather than a */*. The two effects that returned artifacts from the graveyard were combined into a single ability. And the ultimate that destroyed all permanents instead spared all of your artifacts. One of the added abilities was artifact creature focused (granting +1/+1), but the other two were just generally useful abilities that would help you smooth your draw and cast extra cards.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Urza, Planeswalker (version #2)</strong><br />
Legendary Planeswalker — Urza<br />
Loyalty – 6<br />
+2: Draw two cards, then discard a card.<br />
+1: Create three 1/1 colorless Soldier artifact creature tokens.<br />
-2: You get an emblem with "Artifact creatures you control get +1/+1."<br />
-4: Exile target creature. You gain life equal to its power.<br />
-7: Shuffle your library, then exile the top four cards from it. Until end of turn, you may play lands and cast spells from among those cards without paying their mana costs.<br />
-9: Artifacts and planeswalkers you control gain indestructible until end of turn. Destroy all nonland permanents.</p>

<p>Planeswalkers are normally tricky to design. Double the number of loyalty abilities, and it gets significantly trickier. But everyone knew that the meld cards, especially Urza, were going to be a major focus of the set, so we had to get it right. There was a lot of playtesting with a lot of tweaking. Each slot had basically the same function even if the execution was a little different (scrying and drawing becomes draw and discard, for example). The one big change was the fourth ability going from artifact reanimation to creature destruction. This was done because Urza needed more answers to creatures attacking it. Also, the set was a little high on artifact reanimation due to the theme being so central. For flavor, we changed the ultimate so that Urza will survive his destructive blast (provided you have 10 or more loyalty).</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Urza, Planeswalker (version #3)</strong><br />
Legendary Planeswalker — Urza<br />
Loyalty – 6<br />
You may activate Urza's loyalty abilities an additional time during each of your turns.<br />
+2: Draw two cards, then discard a card.<br />
+1: Create two 1/1 colorless Soldier artifact creature tokens.<br />
-0: Artifact, instant, and sorcery spells cost you 2 less to cast this turn.<br />
-4: Exile target creature. You gain 4 life.<br />
-9: Artifacts and planeswalkers you control gain indestructible until end of turn. Destroy all nonland permanents.</p>

<p>This was the biggest change to the card. To make the card feel grander, the design traded in an activated ability (the impulsive draw) for a static one. How do we make Urza feel powerful? Let him use two loyalty abilities a turn. This is closer to print, with just a few tiny tweaks. I'm happy with how it ended up, and I think it does a great job of capturing the moment of Urza's spark igniting for the first time.</p>

<p>Here's the art description:</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Setting</strong>: The Brothers' War<br />
<strong>Color</strong>: LEGENDARY planeswalker<br />
<strong>Location</strong>: On the coast of Argoth (p. 93–95 for reference) after Act III (p. 122–125 for environmental notes)<br />
<strong>Action</strong>: Show us URZA (p. 5d) walking across a landscape TURNED TO DARK GLASS by a massive explosion. We can see Urza's eyes have been cleanly replaced by the MIGHTSTONE (p. 133d) and WEAKSTONE (p. 133b), lit from within by a dim glow. Maybe we may see a slice of blinding white light closing behind Urza, as if he has just stepped out of a rip in reality. It could be snowing or raining, or there could be a strong wind blowing across the landscape.<br />
<strong>Focus</strong>: Urza<br />
<strong>Mood</strong>: Ultimate power, apotheosis<br />
<strong>Notes</strong>: This card is a meld card, which means it can be played after two other cards [(430164) and (430180)] have been played. You may want to combine elements of those images in the composition of this image.</p>

<p>Teferi lay shirtless in a cold metal coffin, counting his breath. How much time did he have before transmission? A minute at most, though it felt like an eternity.</p>

<p>A quick double knock on the lid of the coffin. Kaya, asking if he was ready.</p>

<p>It had been a month and some days of testing, of venturing back an hour, a day, a week at a time, ensuring that nothing changed, that the secret phrases Kaya and Saheeli wrote down and planted days prior were accurately reported back to the present; a month of this and Kaya still asked if he was ready. If he was okay. Teferi smiled inside the coffin, a soft and sad smile. These new walkers were different from the ones he had come up with. More human—even if they weren't human.</p>

<p>Teferi knocked twice on the inside of the lid. He was ready.</p>

<p>A faint purple glow spread before him, brightening his vision with ultraviolet and deeper shades. A lightness tingled his fingertips, his toes.</p>

<p>A comforting thought, should he not return: Kaya would lead them all. She and Elspeth, and Jace besides. Good hands. Teferi exhaled and tried to get comfortable. He thought of Wrenn and her songs.</p>

<p>The metal never seemed to warm, no matter how long he lay on it. How long did <em>The Antiquities</em> <em>War</em> say Tawnos was in his coffin? Five years?</p>

<p>"You can ask him," Kaya said. Her voice was faint, sibilant in his mind. He couldn't hear her—she spoke through him, for him. In this middle stage between corporeal and insubstantial, there was less and less of a distinction between the two of them.</p>

<p>Teferi laughed, Kaya laughed. They couldn't stop themselves—the nerves, the fatigue. Kaya was his medium; she was already in his head. More accurately, <em>he</em> was in <em>hers</em>.</p>

<p>"Remember," Kaya whispered. "Concentrate on the sky. Find the deepest dark."</p>

<p>Teferi did. The Temporal Anchor's humming climbed another step.</p>

<p>"Time is a tapestry, and you are a needle."</p>

<p>Piercing. Howling.</p>

<p>The coffin started to grow hot. Teferi's breath came faster. He couldn't hear anything but the layered tones of the anchor rising. He heard Kaya and Saheeli shouting across the cacophony to each other, Kaya's voice echoing in his own mind.</p>

<p>He never got used to this part. He hated this moment, this tearing of his spark and soul from his body—</p>

<p>"Go."</p>

<p class="embedImageCaption">Art by: <a href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&amp;output=spoiler&amp;method=visual&amp;artist=+[%22Kekai%20Kotaki%22]" target="_blank">Kekai Kotaki</a></p></div></div>

<hr />
<p>He felt his body slip away,</p>

<p>and with it the cold metal</p>

<p>of the facsimile coffin.</p>

<hr />
<p>The mission was not the problem. They had their target identified, and they knew where to look for answers. They had power, they had weapons, they had knowledge, and they had allies. Crucially, they had a new sylex.</p>

<p>The problem was they didn't know how to <em>use</em> the damn thing.</p>

<p>Saheeli had built an essentially perfect replica from Karn's plans and notes, but for all her brilliance she remained only an engineer. The mystery of the sylex's activation was not mechanical—it was magical, a spell buried in history, and history was unreliable.</p>

<p>To wit:</p>

<p>The Golgothian sylex had first been created or discovered by Feldon, a scholar of languages and ancient glaciers, some decades before the Brothers' War. As well, it had been created by Ashnod, carved from the skullcap of the qadir her master, Mishra, replaced. Also, it had been pulled from Old Phyrexia's deepest ichor well by Gix, a demon who slouched to Dominaria out from dreams of steel and oil. Also, the sylex had been chiseled from a giant's tooth and kept by the kobolds of the Khers; as well it was one of Tal's hardened tears, the spell-frozen corona of a falling star, the melted heart of a mountain hammered into shape by Sardian dwarves, and so on, and so on.</p>

<p>The myths of that old world-ender's beginning filled reams, and there was no way to tell which one was true. Likewise, for the sylex's end.</p>

<p>Karn believed his to be the real one, but histories Teferi had dug up spoke of the sylex being destroyed by Urza, or shattered by Jared Carthalion, or consumed by a great and long dead dragon, or tossed into a lake as tribute to some icebound god.</p>

<p>By Teferi's reckoning there were four or five sylexes worth following up on, and contradictory histories for all of them: thus, the anchor, the needle, and the tapestry.</p>

<p>"So how do we find it?" Saheeli asked. She had a direct, solutions-focused mode that Teferi appreciated in a crisis.</p>

<p>Teferi looked out over the papers, scrolls, manuscripts, etchings, and ancient tomes spread before him. They covered the old drafting table, a layer of history encompassing thousands of years of Dominarian legend. All of them were useless, he thought, save for one.</p>

<p>Teferi reached out and shoved the histories aside, knocking some to the floor as he searched. He had read and discarded it early on—not for a lack of craft, but for a lack of specifics.</p>

<p>Saheeli said nothing. She arched an eyebrow and watched the time mage throw valuable texts into musty corners until he stood, triumphant, holding a mold-scarred manuscript.</p>

<p>"<em>The Antiquities War</em>," Teferi said. He slapped the papers on the table and opened them. "Here," he said, stabbing a finger on the moldering epic. "Urza's wife, Kayla bin-Kroog, wrote this epic chronicling the history of the war she herself bore witness to. There are many versions and translations, but they all end the same way: Urza activated the sylex on Argoth and ended the war." Teferi looked up at Saheeli. "We go here—the last battle of the Brothers' War."</p>

<p>"Good enough." Saheeli nodded. "I'll get to work."</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align:right;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/NIxlrtskeG.jpg" />

<hr />
<p>He felt her there with him</p>

<p>He was her needle through time,</p>

<p>a spirit who echoed, echoed,</p>

<hr />
<p>Echoed.</p>

<p>Urza, this coffin, the sylex, the Phyrexians—threads enough for Teferi to be sure that there was some greater cosmic architecture, some logic animating this moment that even he could not hope to understand. Fate's unknowable tempo moving not just Teferi, but all of them in a grand orchestration through history. All Teferi could do was look backwards through his furrowed path and hope that something in his wake would hint at what was to come.</p>

<p>Teferi kept this worry private. It would not be reassuring to his friends and allies to see the consummate chronomage so reduced. To know he was a captain standing blindfolded at the rudder, only a sailor who had not once been to sea.</p>

<p>At night he stood alone in his room near the top of old Urza's tower, staring at the worn floor, unable to sleep.</p>

<p>Teferi was just as lost as the rest of them.</p>

<hr />
<p>The darkness was absolute,</p>

<p>He floated, a</p>

<p>Alone?</p>

<hr />
<p>Teferi's head ached. With all this temporal sojourning, he hadn't slept well in weeks. Or maybe he did—maybe he had been asleep this whole time. He didn't remember.</p>

<p>In the coffin Teferi wore a blindfold over his eyes and a simple set of underclothes. A bandage wrapped around his midsection. Though it had been some time and Elspeth had laid on hands and treated his wound with Halo, the Phyrexian creature had wounded him deep. He felt its ache when he breathed, though this, too, he kept to himself. Whether phyresis gnawed away at his marrow or the Phyrexians threatened the barricaded doors of this chamber, the approach of death was steady and unstoppable. Unless—</p>

<p>Echoes. Time. History repeating itself, with variations. Teferi did not know whether the creature that carved him open had left glistening oil in him. He did not know if Elspeth, Wrenn, Jodah, and the others would fail to hold them back now. All he could do was play his part.</p>

<p>Teferi managed his breathing. He didn't know when now was.</p>

<p>Had he died? Or was there someone else in the darkness with him?</p>

<hr />
<p>Count the beats</p>

<p>One, two, three, four,</p>

<p>What was taking him so long—</p>

<hr />
<p>All Teferi had learned from time travel was the easy and true joke: it was only possible to go forward, once, and only at the pace of life.</p>

<p>Urza cracked this axiom. Teferi had been there and knew that it cost nearly everything. Since his own brush with time, he had stayed away from violating that law. Manipulating time was casting sparks in a drought-dried ocean of grass: conflagration was all but assured. The only thing left to chance was the might of the fire that would follow.</p>

<p>But when the field was already burning? When the fire had already swallowed up everything?</p>

<hr />
<p>for both</p>

<p>the needle and its thread, flashing—</p>

<p>Once set in motion, you can't stop it</p>

<hr />
<p>Silver.</p>

<p>Silver could evade time's ironclad law. Urza discovered that silver could travel physically back in time, made Karn and, Teferi supposed, started this whole affair.</p>

<p>Physical travel was not what Teferi and the others needed or desired. Physical travel would be the same as standing in the conflagration and dousing oneself with lamp oil. No, they didn't need to go back themselves—they only needed to <em>see</em> what occurred.</p>

<p>Saheeli had cracked the problem. Forgo the silver; if you're heading into a conflagration, go as a spark. By extracting one's spirit and casting that back, one would be unable to interact with the past while remaining able to observe—the flipside must also be true, or at least not false.</p>

<p>On paper, this made sense.</p>

<p>So had Urza's plan, Teferi reminded himself—and how did that end? Tolaria in flames, rifts torn in time, that endless lingering. Had there not been a threat so great to warrant this endeavor, Teferi would never have agreed to undertake this expedition.</p>

<p>Had there not been a threat so great, Urza never—</p>

<p>Yes, yes, Teferi thought. Of course.</p>

<hr />
<p>And in the end? What</p>

<p>would they both say of their timelessness?</p>

<p>It was like falling, like dancing.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>85 AR</strong></p>

<p>Teferi arrived in a dark room in a flooded city that he would later learn to be Kroog.</p>

<p>There, he watched a brutal man go mad and scream about ghosts and assassins. This was worrying: no one should be able to see him. None of the tests they ran indicated that anyone could see him as a spirit.</p>

<p>Teferi departed; anyway, this was not the moment he was looking for.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>28 AR</strong></p>

<p>Teferi stood in a dark alley under a burning sky. He was back in Kroog. He recognized it immediately from the towers: during his first visit they were crumbled ruins. Now, they stood proud above a city under siege. The bells thundered above rising screams.</p>

<p>The dead were everywhere.</p>

<p>This was not the Last Battle, but Teferi lingered for a moment. A soldier, a boy in what Teferi would later learn to be a Fallaji uniform, reached out to him. He said something over and over, a plaintive word that, while Teferi told himself he did not understand, he knew he understood.</p>

<p>"Father," the boy gasped. The boy died.</p>

<p>Teferi stood, jaw clenched. His body back in the coffin twitched, as one does when they are dreaming.</p>

<p>"Not yet," he whispered.</p>

<p>Kaya, who saw everything Teferi saw, never spoke about this moment to anyone.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>44 AR</strong></p>

<p>Teferi walked through a charnel valley somewhere southeast of Tomakul. This was the same war as the one he saw days prior, now decades later. Metastasized to its mechanized apex.</p>

<p>Long, deep trenches striated the land. If Teferi could fly above it, he would look down on a world rippling with muddy scars. Machine and human corpses were thick as crops in a farmer's field, draped over trench and wire, twisted and broken. Between them marched columns of soldiers laden with packs under rain-slicked coats. These were armies of men more dead than alive, as spectral in soul as Teferi was in body.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align:right;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/Nuj6CksvHs.jpg" />
<p class="embedImageCaption">Art by: <a href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&amp;output=spoiler&amp;method=visual&amp;artist=+[%22Sam%20Burley%22]" target="_blank">Sam Burley</a></p></div></div>

<p>Once the armies passed, ghouls stalked the fields of the dead, harvesting the bodies they found useful. Teferi watched as black-clad and shuddering figures loaded crude, wheeled carts with human and machine corpses, hauling them away toward Tomakul, until one of them saw him.</p>

<p>Teferi departed, steeling himself. If this unremembered field had seemed to him a circle of hell, then what terrors did the Last Battle hold?</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>4562 AR</strong></p>

<p>Teferi, Kaya, and Saheeli sat around the open coffin, Teferi eating while Kaya and Saheeli drank coffee. It was some horrible time between night and morning. None of them slept anymore.</p>

<p>Outside it was quiet. Kaya told Teferi that Elspeth had been in an hour or two before he emerged. She had asked about his progress and told them that the Phyrexians were close.</p>

<p>"What does 'close' mean?" Saheeli had asked her.</p>

<p>"Bar the door when I leave," Elspeth had responded. She had been on the line with the other Planeswalkers, and her voice was hoarse from shouting over the sounds of combat.</p>

<p>Time was running out. Success or failure, they were stuck inside until the end.</p>

<p>"I found it," Teferi said, breaking the silence.</p>

<p>"When?" Kaya asked.</p>

<p>"When I was coming back," Teferi said. "I saw it, like a scar. Part of the tapestry blotted out, like ink spilled on a page. Blotted time. I haven't been to that one yet."</p>

<p>Kaya nodded. She didn't need an explanation.</p>

<p>"The anchor might not be able to take another sojourn," Saheeli said. Her voice was softest of the three of them, but it carried best in this cold and vaulted room.</p>

<p>"What happens if the anchor fails while he's inside?" Kaya asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know," Saheeli admitted. "I would guess that he dies. His body dies, at least. His spark," she waved her hand, fingers dancing toward the ceiling. "Nothing good."</p>

<p>"And her?" Teferi said, nodding toward Kaya. "She is my medium—she's back there with me. What would happen to her?"</p>

<p>"Teferi, I only built the anchor," Saheeli said. "I'm an engineer. I know how it <em>could</em> fail. The anchor's powerstone could erupt, or the temporal bridge would collapse. The coffin would overheat and implode." Saheeli sipped her coffee. "I know how machines break," she said, "not what happens to a soul when it is severed from its body."</p>

<p>They let Saheeli's words be the last on the topic. They finished their coffee and small foods. Wordlessly, Teferi slid back into the coffin and draped the cloth back over his eyes.</p>

<p>"Ready?" Kaya asked Saheeli.</p>

<p>"Ready," Saheeli agreed.</p>

<p>"Teferi?"</p>

<p>"Let's go," Teferi said. "I'll see you all in a little while."</p>

<p>Kaya closed the coffin lid. In the darkness, Teferi slipped away.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>63 AR</strong></p>

<p><em>Urza sat cross-legged with the bowl in his lap. The runes within the bowl spiraled toward the center. Blood from the gushing wound on his forehead dribbled into the bowl and filled the carved runes with crimson.</em></p>

<p>In the present day, Kaya whispered her dialogue with Teferi, relaying everything that he saw. Her voice had a deeper resonance, a layering that placed Teferi's voice under her own. Saheeli, though she was occupied with running the anchor, could not help but listen.</p>

<p>"The blood from the cut on Urza's forehead is dropping into the bowl, filling the runes. He's sitting cross-legged with the bowl in his lap," Kaya muttered. She swayed, sweating, hands placed on the coffin.</p>

<p><em>The Mishra machine had recovered from the avalanche and was now charging up the hill, its dragon head screaming. Urza looked up and saw his brother's face, half-torn from the metallic skull beneath, and wept for him.</em></p>

<p>"His brother is close to him. It could be triggered by a kind of sympathetic resonance between the two. Maybe it takes more than one person focused, some heightened emotional state—or could it be the proximity of Phyrexian technology," Kaya said.</p>

<p>"What else?" Kaya asked.</p>

<p>"Tears. Lots of tears. Urza never cried. He's so<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> human, here," she replied.</p>

<p><em>The Mishra machine had attained the hilltop now, and its serpent head loomed high above them. Mishra was grinning, the smile half-flesh and half-steel. It was the grin of a man triumphant.</em></p>

<p><em>Mishra was screaming something.</em></p>

<p><em>A flash at the base of the bowl—</em></p>

<p><em>A flash at the base of the bowl—</em></p>

<p><em>A flash at the base—</em></p>

<p><em>A flash—</em></p>

<p>"STOP!"</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>4562 AR</strong></p>

<p>Teferi slipped back to the present.</p>

<p>He barely made it out of the coffin before he retched, coughing out a thin mix of water and salt crackers onto the cold stone floor of the chamber. He trembled, the wound at his side aching. Behind the blindfold he wore against the brightness of the real world, a kaleidoscope of color pinwheeled.</p>

<p>"I almost have it," he lied as Kaya helped him out of the coffin. "I think it has to do with the blood, or maybe the depth of the grooves. Saheeli," Teferi shouted. "Does your sylex spiral? The runes?"</p>

<p>"Of course it does," Saheeli shouted back from the base of the anchor, where she was busy making small adjustments and repairs.</p>

<p>Kaya pressed a cold towel to Teferi's forehead. "Listen," she said, steadying him as he swayed. "What we're seeing back there—what your spirit is exposed to—it's brutal."</p>

<p>"Do we have time to rest?" Teferi asked.</p>

<p>"Eat," Kaya said, ignoring the question.</p>

<p>Teferi ate a small amount, as much as his stomach could handle. He took a sip of water, then climbed back inside the coffin. The sound of fighting outside the chamber went unremarked.</p>

<p>"Hurry," Kaya said. "Please. This is difficult for me as well." Her usual demeanor, her devil-may-care attitude was gone.</p>

<p>Kaya was right and Teferi knew it. As his medium, she may as well have been right there with him every time he cast back.</p>

<p>"Give me as much time as you can," Teferi said.</p>

<p>Kaya looked at the barricade they had piled against the chamber door, then back to Teferi. "Last one," she said. She closed the coffin lid and slammed its latches locked.</p>

<p>In the quiet of the stasis coffin, Teferi felt he could be anywhere. It was warm now, comfortable, and stank of his sweat. He exhaled and waited for Kaya to do her work.</p>

<p>Two soft taps on the lid of the coffin—her hands. A purple whorl, spreading like silent fire across the inner lid, bright through his blindfold.</p>

<p>His body dropped away. He was anywhere.</p>

<hr />
<p>A division between real-time—that is, what Teferi thought of as the present day, which he could not see beyond—and <em>back then</em>. With the aid of Saheeli's Temporal Anchor and Kaya's extraction and mediumship, it was an easy enough task for Teferi to step between real-time and back then; the difficulty was fatigue and navigation. He could go back to any point he could remember but had to discover the moment first. The travel left him exhausted and weak.</p>

<p>Teferi, as best he could, set his fears aside. He tried to let the task at hand replace them. A month of meticulous searching, and he had finally found the moment he needed when it was most desperate. The Phyrexians were, quite literally, at the door.</p>

<p>Alone Teferi stood under a firmament his mind told him was a night sky and searched it for the dark nebula he knew to be the Brothers' War. He found it and stepped inside, his spirit crossing millennia with a thought. Inside that space was a manifold darkness, a nothingness patterned with textures Teferi had only just begun to comprehend.</p>

<p>He found the curious one, the stygian blot he hoped was the Last Battle, and—as a needle plunging through cloth—dove inside.</p>

<hr />
<p>A black sky. A rain-lashed beach. Ticking and twitching metal ruins, still dragging themselves toward their enemies. Two titanic constructs collapsed across each other over the wild-burning old growth. Behind him, oil-slick waves crashed and roared, dragging dead bodies up and down the stained sand.</p>

<p>Argoth. The Last Battle. Moments before the end of the world, again.</p>

<p><strong>63 AR</strong></p>

<p><em>The Mishra machine had attained the hilltop now, and its serpent head loomed high above them. Mishra was grinning, the smile half-flesh and half-steel. It was the grin of a man triumphant.</em></p>

<p><em>Mishra was screaming something.</em></p>

<p><em>A flash at the base of the bowl—</em></p>

<p>Everything stopped.</p>

<p>That was not entirely accurate. Everything slowed. With a gesture, Teferi divided time's progression by halves down to an infinite number. Time, as much as Teferi could observe, froze.</p>

<p>Command over time was an awesome power. Godly. Teferi knew it to be ruinous, so he was a careful practitioner. He had thought the answer lay in observation, in taking special care with this moment to note every detail of Urza's movements, emotions, and words. There was so much he did not know, so he tried to observe and report on every single thing—even the rain, just in case that was a component of the spell.</p>

<p>All his care rewarded him with nothing. None of what he saw even so much as warmed the bowl of Saheeli's facsimile sylex. He had to find some way to step beyond.</p>

<p>Teferi thought of a way. It was a risk. Was this not a risk? Everything could go wrong, yes, but back in his time everything was already going wrong: Karn was gone, the Phyrexians were on Dominaria again, Jaya was dead, their last redoubt was about to fall. What was the worst that could happen? Teferi thought. The end of the Multiverse?</p>

<p>Circumstances pushed him to be reckless. That infinite halving that protected him also distanced him; he needed to align his time with Urza's.</p>

<p>It was a terrible risk. Teferi weighed what he knew: Urza did not die when the sylex detonated. No one knew how he came back or when, but Teferi knew him when he was young. He had studied under him at the Tolarian Academy. However, just because Urza lived it did not mean Teferi—even as a spirit—could withstand the sylex's blast. That artifact was more than just a bomb: the Shard of Twelve Worlds, the Ice Age, every important event over the last four millennia—everything came after this moment. His family came after this moment. If Teferi could have taken a deep breath, he would have. A thought, as he acted: existence is not guaranteed.</p>

<p>Teferi stopped holding back time.</p>

<p>The Multiverse tore open.</p>

<p>Everything came after.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>??????</strong></p>

<p>What remained of Urza sat cross-legged on a scrape of Argothian earth. The sylex was balanced on his lap, its bowl filled with white, scouring light frozen in bloom.</p>

<p>Teferi stood a short distance away, a spirit in soft hues. He could see little of Urza behind the light emitting from the sylex, but enough to make out the Planeswalker's silhouette inside the detonation.</p>

<p>Together, the two of them were alone in an empyrean void. The ground underneath them was a small patch of Argoth, and then blank nothingness in all directions. To Teferi, it looked as if they were standing within the belly of a cloud.</p>

<p>Urza. How long had it been since Teferi had last seen him? How many lifetimes, how many lives? Teferi walked over to Urza and sat opposite the sylex. He cleared his throat.</p>

<p>"I need to tell you some things about the future," Teferi said to Urza. "Your future, my present. It concerns everything."</p>

<p>Urza looked up, his face a raw, grinning skull. "What?" he said, his voice unburnt.</p>

<p>"They won't be good things," Teferi emphasized.</p>

<p>"Curious," Urza said. He looked at the sylex, at the light creeping out from an illuminated point in the bowl's nadir, then out at the space that surrounded them. "One does not expect happy news in a formless void," he muttered. "Is this the afterlife?"</p>

<p>"No," Teferi said. "I hope not."</p>

<p>"Fine, then," Urza said. "Who are you?"</p>

<p>"In a moment—I need to ask for your help."</p>

<p>"You said you are from my future," Urza said, ignoring Teferi's insistence. "That you need my help. How do you know whether you talking to me will change anything?" Urza waved at the vastness of eternity. "Or worse—maybe it will change everything."</p>

<p>Teferi hesitated. "I'm not sure," he said. "We had to take this chance."</p>

<p>"We," Urza said. A question, posed as a comment. "Either what you're going to tell me matters a great deal, or it doesn't matter at all."</p>

<p>"That seems so," Teferi muttered. The two men fell silent. They looked once more at the sylex, that ruinous thing.</p>

<p>"You should know first that you are a great man now," Teferi said. "But you're nothing like what you will become." He tapped the edge of the sylex. The solid core of the light, tense as brimming water at the bowl's lip now, wobbled. That light was doom, Teferi thought. He was staring at the end of one age and the dawn of another.</p>

<p>"And what is that?" Urza asked. He cradled the bowl in his lap. Most of him was burned away by the sylex's detonation, but he did not appear to be in pain. Blackened flesh peeled back to expose scoured bone, and where there was nothing there was a brighter light—a spark, coalescing.</p>

<p>His spark. In this moment, Urza was becoming what he would become.</p>

<p>"Some would probably call you a god." Teferi thought back to his school days. "Others would call you a curse. I called you my teacher; most know you as 'Planeswalker.'"</p>

<p>Urza could not smile anymore—his skull had blackened and crumbled, his shoulders and ribs burned to ash. And yet his voice was strong as when he was whole.</p>

<p>"There's nothing I can do to change that, is there?" Urza asked. He sounded exhausted, not plaintive. Fatigued as a man gone decades without sleep.</p>

<p>"If I'm here now," Teferi whispered, "I don't think there's anything you or I can do to change what will happen. Time does not pass like the hand of a clock: it's already happening."</p>

<p>"Then what is this," Urza said, gesturing at the formless void that surrounded them. He stood, staggering up to his feet, the whole of his torso tumbling in gray clumps of ash.</p>

<p>"Allow me to lecture for a moment?" Teferi asked.</p>

<p>"Take all the time you need," Urza said, a sarcastic snarl creeping into his voice.</p>

<p>Teferi, still seated, leaned back, resting as one does in a soft field of grass, as if soaking in the sun. "There are many metaphors for time," Teferi began. "All of them are true, to some degree. Together they form a mosaic of understanding." Teferi watched as Urza stepped to the edge of the ground. If he had features left, Teferi guessed he would be staring out into the void.</p>

<p>"There's something out there," Urza whispered. "Hurry."</p>

<p>"People say time flows like a river," Teferi said. "But that only imagines time moving <em>forward</em>."</p>

<p>Despite his evident frustration, Urza was curious. He listened as Teferi spoke.</p>

<p>"That is neither totally wrong nor totally right. It's just limited by our perspective. Humans, I mean. We have one angle into the prism of existence: we only ever see time going one way, so to imagine time as a river isn't wrong. And since we're all a part of this," Teferi waved a hand at the void around them, "our metaphor contains some of the truth. Rivers are agents of time's passage. They exist on a scale larger than us. They also hold mysteries: If we were to walk alongside any river—the Mardun, maybe—we'd come across places where it tumbles into whorls and eddies, shoots off on little branches that go nowhere, or join other rivers, or are snipped off into their own lakes. Those lakes are places where the river stops; if time is a river, then those lakes are moments where time stops." Teferi said "I think we're in one of those right now."</p>

<p>After a moment's pause, Urza finally spoke. "Why?"</p>

<p>Teferi smiled and shook his head. "No idea. I took a risk based off what I knew to be true—I'm just as surprised to be here as you are."</p>

<p>"You say in the future I become a teacher?"</p>

<p>"Many thousands of years from now," Teferi said.</p>

<p>Urza scoffed. "My pedagogy needs work," he said. Gruff, but not unkind. Teferi knew the Urza of his own youth in Tolaria well enough to know the old goat approved of his decision. "So, what's next?" Urza said. "What do I need to know so I can tell you what you need to know?"</p>

<p>"You're going to encounter more of them," Teferi said. He did not need to explain; Urza understood who "them" meant. His brother, and the demon from Koilos.</p>

<p>"You're going to spend your life trying to fight the Phyrexians. First for what they did to your brother, and then for what they will do to you."</p>

<p>"Is that what that thing is called?" Urza muttered. "A whole race of them<nbsp> . . .</nbsp>" He was too insubstantial to emote, but Teferi saw light creeping in at the raw edges where Urza's body once was, latticing through the burned void. In the empty sockets where his eyes once were, new light began to glow: one red, and one green.</p>

<p>Urza was being remade. Stitched together into something else.</p>

<p>Planeswalker.</p>

<p>"You lose," Teferi said. "The Phyrexians win. You fight them for millennia, but they always win. You discover there are more worlds than one, more than even you can count. Each occupies a plane of existence, and together they are bound up in a space called the Multiverse. You travel these planes for centuries and discover there are others who can travel them as well. Eventually, you establish a school—that's where we first meet, at this school—and you try to crack open the mysteries of time. You succeed but find you cannot go back."</p>

<p>"Then how did you manage it?"</p>

<p>"With great difficulty," Teferi said with a weary smile.</p>

<p>Skin filled in over Urza's light-woven scaffolding, raw and young, bleeding across to fill his features like a peach crushed on a white sheet. His lips re-formed in time for him to frown.</p>

<p>"Get to the point," Urza said. "Despite everything, I do not stop the Phyrexians. You are here having travelled through time in a way I could not. Why?"</p>

<p>Teferi could hear the pain in his old instructor's voice. Here he was, trapped at the moment of his death with a desperate man from the future who told him that his war did not end here. That his final act did not grant him any peace, but only unlocked a door holding back an even greater war, one whose trail of ruin was unavoidable, one that would stretch across thousands of years and claim countless lives. Had he been a kinder man, Teferi would have stopped talking. He would not have told Urza the truth.</p>

<p>Am I as cruel as he? Teferi wondered. As necessary? Time will tell.</p>

<p>"The Phyrexians are back," Teferi said. "In my time they threaten the whole of the Multiverse. As we speak, my body lies in your tower, surrounded by other Planeswalkers like us. The Phyrexians are attacking; they're trying to stop us from learning how to stop them before their invasion can begin."</p>

<p>Urza was nearly whole. "Why not go back to when I—when we—first beat the Phyrexians?" He asked. "What happened then that is so much worse than now?"</p>

<p>"No," Teferi said. He thought of Zhalfir. Of Shiv. Of the Mirage War. Of time torn apart and Urza's fury. "Not then. Never."</p>

<p>"Then why now?"</p>

<p>"The sylex," Teferi said. "In our time we have a facsimile of this one. Saheeli—a brilliant woman from a plane you would think is paradise—she recreated this very device: all we need to know how to do is activate it."</p>

<p>"You're going to use it against the Phyrexians?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And that will end this?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Urza nodded. "Give me some room," he said, waving Teferi back. Urza approached the sylex and stood over it. The obliterating light would soon grow to eclipse the setting sun. He sat. He gripped the edge of the bowl and lifted it back into his lap. Once more his body began to smolder away, flaking into ash—this time revealing the lattice of light underneath.</p>

<p>Teferi recalled what power had been like before the Mending. The body was only a vessel: the spark was greater.</p>

<p>"I held it like so," Urza said. He was contemplative. His voice hitched for a moment as his upper body burned away again—and yet, though the light streaming from the sylex was overpowering, Teferi could still see Urza's silhouette within it, a brighter light somehow. A being refusing death.</p>

<p>"I let the blood from the cut my brother dealt me fall into it," Urza said. "I felt the weight of Terisiare on my heart," he thought for a moment. "I could hear the whole world crying out—I didn't need to read the runes here to understand what they meant." He traced a solar finger across the belly of the bowl. "There was a woman during the war—Hurkyl, of the College of Lat-Nam." Urza spoke aloud, but not to Teferi.</p>

<p>Teferi listened—anything Urza said could be the key.</p>

<p>"They said she could use magic," Urza shook his head. "I didn't believe the stories, but I was wrong. Hurkyl's meditation was real: a method by which one could make themselves a conduit for the<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> soul of the land: love, pain, joy, fear, emotion, and memory. All of it, channeled through a single point. Through a single person, who could draw this power through them and project it into the world. This is what I called upon when I used the sylex. I had nothing left, and when I held this in my hands, I poured <em>everything</em> into it. Then it all ended." Urza looked up at Teferi. "As soon as I held it, I knew what to do. That's all I can tell you."</p>

<p>Teferi understood. With horror, he understood. There was no unknown spell to discover, no secret mechanism by which Urza activated his sylex. Hurkyl's meditations were well documented. The runic carvings on the sylex had been cast and re-cast, etched in perfect replica on Saheeli's copy. It was all known and understood. They had everything they needed but the person. The trigger to detonate the sylex was not a spell or an artifact—it was a person.</p>

<p>"I think our time is up," Urza said, pointing into the void above Teferi's head.</p>

<p>They looked up toward the empyrean distance. Cracks spidered across the infinitude, silent and seeping. Against the blank unfathomable space, numberless, dark fingers began to probe. Shadows, pressing against this enclave. They were overstaying their welcome. Something was coming for them.</p>

<p>"Will I remember this?" Urza asked.</p>

<p>"No, I don't think you will," Teferi replied. "Our lake—it just becomes part of the river again."</p>

<p>"I thought as much." Urza stood. "Thousands of years of this," he whispered. "Gods, I'm not ready."</p>

<p>"You are," Teferi said. "You have to be."</p>

<p>Urza looked at Teferi, his eyes flashing ruby and emerald facets. "You never told me," he said. "What is your n—"</p>

<p>The void broke.</p>

<p>The dark rushed in.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>64 AR</strong></p>

<p>And there was silence in Terisiare.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>69 AR</strong></p>

<p>What had once been a verdant coastline was now awash with debris. The flotsam of great trees and the jetsam of huge boulders had been driven miles into shore, creating a blasted region along the shore, devoid of life.</p>

<p>Among the wreckage was a large metal box, seven feet in length, three feet in width and height. It had weathered the destruction and came to rest among the other far-flung remains of what had been Argoth.</p>

<p>Urza stood alongside the box and pressed his hand against the lid.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align:right;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/lfK9HFSAg3.jpg" />

<p>The box's top slid along its casters, revealing the slumbering form of his former apprentice. Tawnos took a breath, then sat bolt upright, gasping for air. His face was pale, and he was covered with dead skin that had flaked off but had nowhere to go within his confinement.</p>

<p>Urza waited for Tawnos to regain his composure, standing as patient as a statue. Tawnos took a deep breath, held it, then took a second one. Then he looked around at the devastation that surrounded them.</p>

<p>"It is over," said Urza, sitting on the edge of the box.</p>

<p>Tawnos gulped and looked around. "This was the safest hiding place I could think of," he said. Urza did not reply. Tawnos said, "Your brother?"</p>

<p>"Dead," said Urza. "I<nbsp> . . .</nbsp>" He shook his head. "The demon, the Phyrexian, killed my brother long ago. I never realized it."</p>

<p>"Where are we?" asked Tawnos.</p>

<p>Urza looked around and sighed, deeply. "The southern coast of Yotia."</p>

<p>Tawnos blinked. "It has changed."</p>

<p>"The world has changed," said Urza, "because of what we did. Because of what I did."</p>

<p>Tawnos climbed out of the box, and Urza helped him. Tawnos felt weak from his incarceration and rubbed his arms and legs, both to shake off the dead skin and to restore circulation. It was cold on this shore, colder than Tawnos remembered it as a youth.</p>

<p>"I need one last task from you, my former student," said Urza.</p>

<p>"Name it," said Tawnos.</p>

<p>"I want you to go west. Find the remains of the Union, the scholars of the ivory towers. Tell them what happened here. Tell them what we did, and what we failed to do. See to it that they do not do the same. I trust you to do this."</p>

<p>Tawnos looked at the older man, but it seemed to him that Urza was no longer old. His hair was blond again and his shoulders straight. But his eyes were old beyond years and pained beyond mortal hurt.</p>

<p>"You can always trust me," said Tawnos. "Where are you going?"</p>

<p>Urza turned from his former pupil. "Away," he said after a short while. "I am going<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> away."</p>

<p>"It looks as if we could use your help here," said Tawnos. Urza made a noise that Tawnos thought was a nervous laugh. "I don't think the land could survive any more of my help. I need to<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> I need to go away. And think by myself. Where I will not harm others."</p>

<p>Tawnos nodded, and said, "I don't know if there is any place that far away."</p>

<p>Urza shook his head and said, "There are places far beyond the land of Terisiare, far beyond the world of Dominaria. When I poured my memories into the sylex, I saw them. I see many things that I had never seen before."</p>

<p>He turned back to Tawnos, and the Master Scholar saw Urza's eyes. They were no longer human eyes, but rather two gemstones, radiating with a cascade of multicolored hues: green, white, red, black, and blue.</p>

<p>Mightstone and Weakstone, reunited at last, within the surviving brother.</p>

<p>The image was only for an instant; then Urza's eyes were normal again. Urza smiled. "I must go away," he repeated.</p>

<p>Tawnos nodded slowly, and the man with human crystalline eyes stood. "You have long been a student," said Urza. "Now go be a teacher."</p>

<p>As he spoke, Urza began to fade from view. Slowly the color drained from him, leaving only outlines; then they too faded. "Teach them of our triumphs and our mistakes," said a distant voice. "And tell Kayla to remember me not<nbsp> . . .</nbsp>"</p>

<p>"As you were, but as you tried to be," finished Tawnos, but he was speaking to empty space. Urza had passed from the world into greater worlds that only his crystalline eyes could see.</p>

<p>Tawnos looked around, but there was no sign of life. He struck out inland, hoping to get past the worst of the devastation before he had to travel west. He recognized no familiar landmarks, and he had the feeling that he would not for a long time. Tawnos wondered how bad the devastation truly was.</p>

<p>And as Tawnos walked inland, he was greeted by the first flakes of snow drifting down a chill wind.</p>

<p>Ulf was, he reluctantly admitted to himself, a better researcher than a mage. His practical magic was rudimentary at best, and he almost never inscribed a rune properly—but perhaps that would come with time. Until it did, he tried to keep his head down in his Tolarian classes, not drawing too much attention to himself, making himself useful by mucking out the stables and taking on the other menial tasks that nobody wanted to do. Meanwhile he studied desperately, hoping for a breakthrough.</p>

</div>

<p>But he could only escape notice for so long. Soon one of his docents, a florid-faced dwarven artificer named Thranegeld, singled him out after class.</p>

<p>"You're no good at magic, Ulf," he said in his gravelly voice.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, sir," said Ulf.</p>

<p>"No good at artificing either."</p>

<p>Ulf just nodded.</p>

<p>"What are you good at?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, sir."</p>

<p>"Why are you here?"</p>

<p>"I want to be a mage, sir."</p>

<p>"Don't you think the agricultural program would be a better fit for you? I hear you're an apt hand in the stables."</p>

<p>"I came here to be a mage," Ulf said stubbornly. His father had been opposed to it, had wanted Ulf to stay and inherit the farm. His mother might have encouraged it if she'd been around—rumor was that there was magic on her side of the family—but she had died when he was young. It had been an uphill battle all the way.</p>

<p>The dwarf's eyes narrowed. He took a strange lamp from the table and swung it up, shined it into Ulf's eyes. Ulf blinked, turned away. When the dwarf turned the lamp off, his expression had softened.</p>

<p>"I worried you might be one of them, but no. That's good."</p>

<p>"One of who, sir?"</p>

<p>"A Phyrexian agent," he said. When Ulf looked blank, he continued. "Denizens of the Machine Hells who hope to make our plane their own. They pass as human, but they're hideous mixes of flesh and machines. They long to destroy all we hold dear."</p>

<p>"They're here, in Lat-Nam, in the academy?"</p>

<p>The dwarf nodded. "They're everywhere." He frowned. "As for you, let's start with what you're good at. Research. You can do that, I grant you. Let's have us a deal. You can keep coming to class, but you'll do a little research for me on the side."</p>

<hr />
<p>It seemed an ordinary enough request. Ulf had heard the other students talking: more than a few had been assigned some extra task by one of the docents. Thranegeld's class was on the ancient world, on what the world had been before the Rift Era. Each student had been given a project to research. Which meant Ulf had his regular assigned topic, on the sylex blast, that he would have to report on in the class. But now he also had another, special project.</p>

<p>"Corondor," Thranegeld growled. "Let's see how good a researcher you are, boy. Find out whatever you can. Not the usual, mind: side tunnels." And when Ulf turned to go: "No need to discuss this with your fellow students."</p>

<p>When researching the sylex blast, he found himself in the same section of the library as the other students, poring over the well-thumbed collection of books that students had been using to write up the same assignments for years. This quickly gave him enough for his report—though, he also tracked down a book or two farther afield that gave a little more: details that he imagined hadn't appeared in student papers before. Researching Corondor was harder. In the section where he had first found information on the sylex blast, there was very little, only bland details, the agreed-upon stories that every child knew. Even when he extended his search there was not much. On a lower shelf where the relevant texts were meant to be housed, there was only a blank gap: the books were missing, and there was no clear record of who had them. Misplaced, maybe? Or was there more to it than that?</p>

<p>Or perhaps this was some sort of test. Perhaps Thranegeld had hidden the books himself, was waiting to see what Ulf would do.</p>

<p>For the next few weeks Ulf spent every spare moment in the library. He went shelf to shelf, scanning the titles, reshelving books that were out of place. At first, there were no sign of the missing volumes. Later, he wondered if they had ever existed. Eventually, he found himself away from the main stacks, in side chambers that smelled dark and musty, where scrolls and tomes were piled rather than shelved. But none of these touched on Corondor in more than a cursory way.</p>

<p>And then, in a forgotten corner of one of these side chambers, he saw where a stack had tipped over and spilled some books down against the wall. Among them was an old and mildewed volume, its cover torn away. He picked it up and wiped the grime from it, saw round circles of mold on what remained of the title page, so obscuring it that it was impossible to make out. <em>Are they really circles of mold?</em> he wondered, tracing them with his fingertips. <em>Could they be worn or broken runes?</em> He opened the book and saw it was written in a stilted script and in Old Vodalian. He couldn't make some of the words out—they were unfamiliar and arcane. The language was so evasive and unclear that he was unsure if he was interpreting it correctly, but it seemed to refer to a figure of myth—Sol'kanar, the Demon King of Corondor. Sol'kanar was once a maro-sorcerer, a forest guardian, until he was cursed by the Planeswalker Geyadrone Dihada. As Dihada's demonic servant, Sol'kanar had wielded the legendary Blackblade against Dakkon himself, as well Carth the Lion, the founder of House Carthalion. The book detailed the curse and a variety of ways the curse could be lifted, one of which was through Dihada's death. He smiled. House Carthalion were the rightful rulers of Corondor, but the kingdom had been usurped by Sol'kanar some time ago. The details of his true history—and even how to break his curse—would be very valuable to anyone looking to free Corondor. This find would impress Thranegeld. He'd have to admit Ulf had really discovered something. All he had to do was sort out what it actually was he found, write up his research, and then Thranegeld would recognize that he belonged here.</p>

<p>His smile faltered. What if this was all nonsense? Surely if it was truly an important tome, it would have been preserved with more care. What if this book was a mere child's tale? Or a fantasy?</p>

<p>Before seeing Thranegeld, he would have to get a second opinion.</p>

<hr />
<p>Ulf knocked on the door to Silas Brotten's chambers. Brotten only taught the advanced students. He was an esteemed author, a specialist in Old Vodalian as well as the time period in which the book had been written. For a long moment there was no answer. Ulf was lifting his hand to knock again when he heard Brotten clear his throat and say softly, "Yes?"</p>

<p>Ulf opened the door and stepped inside. Brotten sat in an overstuffed chair, an old scroll open in his lap, a pipe resting on a pewter plate on the table just beside. For a moment, he looked puzzled, and then his face cleared. "Ah, the stable boy. Not bad news about my steed, I hope?"</p>

<p>Ulf blushed. "No sir," he said. "I have a question."</p>

<p>Brotten rolled the scroll up and set it down. "I hadn't realized you were a student as well," he said. "Agricultural program?"</p>

<p>"No sir," he said. "I'm studying magic."</p>

<p>Brotten raised an eyebrow. "I<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> suppose I can spare you a few minutes." He gestured to a chair. "Please sit."</p>

<p>"I've found something," said Ulf, and thrust the book at him.</p>

<p>Brotten took the book lazily, thumbed through it, reading a few words. Suddenly, his attention changed. He sat up straighter, turned back the pages, began to read from the beginning. He glanced at Ulf. "Where did you come across this?" he asked.</p>

<p>When he admitted that he had found it in the library, Brotten's gaze sharpened. "What were you looking for that caused you to find this?"</p>

<p>"I'm on a project for my docent," said Ulf.</p>

<p>"Which docent would that be?"</p>

<p>"Thranegeld, sir."</p>

<p>"Ah, the dwarven artificer. His first-year report."</p>

<p>"Not<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> exactly," said Ulf, but hesitated to go on.</p>

<p>"It's all right," said Brotten, smoothly. "You can tell me. After all, I'm a docent."</p>

<p>"A special project, sir," admitted Ulf. "He sent me to research Corondor."</p>

<p>Brotten nodded. "Well, this is quite a find," he said. "In fact, it might be best if you were to leave it here with me."</p>

<p>Ulf hesitated, then shook his head. "I don't think I can, sir."</p>

<p>"No?"</p>

<p>"I should show it to my docent first."</p>

<p>For a moment Brotten held onto the book, staring at his hands, and then he handed it back. "As you wish," he said. He turned away, seemingly bored, disinterested. "I'll leave you to see yourself out."</p>

<hr />
<p>Thranegeld's hands shook as he held the book. "Do you know how long this has been lost? Where in hell did you find it?" He peered at Ulf closely. "I'm beginning to think there's more to you than meets the eye."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do with it?"</p>

<p>"Me? Nothing. Wouldn't be wise for me to keep it since I didn't do the finding. Rules of the mine: You dig it up, you keep it. No, not just keep it: stash it somewhere safe."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>Thranegeld shook his head. "You decide, but don't tell me. Don't tell anyone, hear? And don't tell anyone you have it."</p>

<p>Baffled, Ulf agreed. He took the book and turned to go, then turned back. "Sir, isn't this exactly the kind of knowledge we should share?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes," said Thranegeld. "In principle, at least." He patted Ulf on the arm. "We'll share it," he said. "I'll write to a friend to set things in motion. When the time's ripe and when we're sure of who our friends are, we'll share it."</p>

<hr />
<p class="rtecenter"><strong>II</strong></p>

<p>In the stables, on the wall where he kept the shovels and rakes he used to clean the stalls, was a little inset cubby. He wrapped the book in oilcloth and secured it there, under a double handful of straw.</p>

<p>He continued to act as normal, returning to the library. He looked for more books on Corondor, but without any real success. A few days later, coming back in the evening from another futile expedition, he found the door to his room ajar. Looking more closely, he saw the doorframe was cracked, the lock forced.</p>

<p>He paused and listened, but he heard no sound from inside. Strange: at this time of night, all three of his roommates were usually there.</p>

<p>Cautiously, he pushed the door wider. He first saw pages strewn all over the floor, then bedding scattered and torn apart as well. The closet was open, its contents spilled out. Had one of his fellow students practiced a spell that had gone awry?</p>

<p>"Hello?" he started to say, but once he opened the door wider, he fell silent.</p>

<p>The far end of the room was bespattered with blood. What he saw next made him feel like his own heart had stopped beating. One of his roommates was lying there, cuts on his arms, throat slit. Another lay turned to face the wall, in a pool of his own blood. The third, he didn't see until he came a little farther in, but he was the worst of all. He had been dismembered, the pieces of him piled in a careful stack near the wall.</p>

<p>He fled.</p>

<hr />
<p>The book was still there, still safe. But how long would it be so? No, whether Thranegeld wanted to take it or not, he <em>had</em> to give it to him. He would tell him what had happened. Together, they would figure out what to do.</p>

<p>He walked back from the stables with the oilcloth-wrapped book clutched to his chest. He kept his head down, trying to look inconspicuous. Enough students were still out, laughing and talking, that he probably didn't seem too out of place. Still, he felt like a target was on his back.</p>

<p>As soon as he was inside, he made a beeline for Docent Thranegeld's chambers. He rushed in without knocking. Thranegeld was at his desk but with his chair turned around, facing the window. "Sir," he said, "sir! They're dead, all of them! The book's not safe, we have to<nbsp> . . .</nbsp>"</p>

<p>He trailed off. Thranegeld had not turned at the sound of his words. He hadn't even moved.</p>

<p>"Sir?" he said.</p>

<p>Ulf's throat felt tight. He moved forward, slowly, and stepped behind the desk. He took another step, and then another, until he was directly behind his teacher, and then he reached out and shook his shoulder.</p>

<p>For an instant nothing happened, and then the dwarf tilted and slid from the chair and onto the floor. When he turned him face up, Ulf saw his face was bone white, etched with terror. Whatever had happened to him, it had not been an easy death.</p>

<hr />
<p><em>Where can I go?</em> he wondered. And then he told himself, <em>Just have to keep moving while I think it through.</em> Who could he trust? He had to talk to someone, had to figure out what to do quickly. If he didn't, he'd soon be dead as well.</p>

<p>He made his way to a bathroom and locked himself in. He stayed there breathing deeply trying to calm down. Eventually his hands stopped shaking. He tucked the book into the pocket of his robe, where it would be out of sight.</p>

<p>He could take the book and run, but where would he go? Who could he take it to? Another academy? Or should he stay here and give it to the archmage? What if he went to the archmage's quarters and found him dead, too?</p>

<p>No, better just to leave while he still could.</p>

<p>Then again, if he left, wouldn't he be blamed for the murders?</p>

<p>He didn't know what to do, didn't know at all. He needed someone to talk to, another person to help him sort it out.</p>

<hr />
<p>"What is it, my rustic scholar?" asked Brotten, and then he looked closer at Ulf. His face creased with concern. "What's wrong? You look like you've seen a ghost."</p>

<p>"He's dead," said Ulf. "They all are."</p>

<p>"Who's dead? Slow down, stable boy. Stop speaking nonsense."</p>

<p>Ulf explained in bits and pieces what had happened. Slowly Brotten managed to put it together.</p>

<p>"I don't know what to do," Ulf finished.</p>

<p>Brotten nodded. He paced about his study, thinking. "My best advice," he finally said slowly, "would be to get rid of the book. That's obviously what they're after."</p>

<p>"But why? Why do they want it? And who are <em>they</em>?"</p>

<p>"Let's hope you never have to learn the answers to those questions," said Brotten. "You're young and untrained, and hardly in a position to protect the book." And then, as if he had just thought of it, "It would be safest, perhaps, if you were to leave the book with me."</p>

<p>Almost by reflex Ulf began to reach for the pocket of his robe. He was so used to listening to his docents, to obeying them, that it was hard not to. But halfway there, his hand stopped. He hesitated.</p>

<p>"Do you have the book with you?" prompted Brotten, "or will you have to lead me to it?" And for just an instant Ulf saw naked desire in Brotten's face.</p>

<p>"I," said Ulf, "I've got to<nbsp> . . .</nbsp>" and he began backing slowly toward the door.</p>

<p>Before he reached it, a transformation began. Brotten's face lost all expression, a bloody line suddenly tracing its way from the center of his forehead down through his chin. With a wet sound his face split and slopped to either side over his shoulders like a mantle, revealing a bundle of cables in place of a neck and a skull of acid-etched metal. His eyes were green, possessed of an unearthly light. <em>A Phyrexian</em>, Ulf realized with horror. He had gone to exactly the wrong person. He had walked straight into evil's maw.</p>

<p>Brotten stood there, a mix of blood and black oil beaded on his skull. He almost casually tore the loose flesh that had been his face away and let it fall to the floor. His voice, when he spoke, was different now, cruel, mechanical, every shred of human warmth bled out of it.</p>

<p>"Give me the book," he snarled. "Now!"</p>

<p>Ulf leaped back. He managed, on his way out, to slam the door behind him, the latch just catching as Brotten sprang forward. He heard the man's howl of irritation as he thumped against the closed door.</p>

<p>Ulf scurried like a rat down the hallway. A moment later, the door exploded as Brotten burst through without bothering to open it.</p>

<p>"Give up now, boy!" he called after Ulf. "If you do, perhaps I'll let you live!"</p>

<p>Ulf sped around the corner, zigzagging between a pair of startled students. A moment later, he heard them gasp in horror. He turned and saw one attempt to hurl a bolt of energy at the creature that had been Brotten. It struck him in the chest, leaving a gaping hole in the flesh that revealed a network of antenna-like wires writhing beneath. One of them whipped out in a flash and darted deep into the student's eye and out the back of his skull. The other student, screaming, tried to run, but Brotten was quickly upon her, blades suddenly flicking from his fingers.</p>

<p>And then Ulf was around a corner again. From a distance, he heard the student's high-pitched scream and then, abruptly, it cut off. He cut through a classroom and out its back door, then climbed the stairs quickly, two steps at a time. At the top, he held his breath and waited, but almost immediately heard heavy footsteps. Brotten must somehow be tracking him—or perhaps Ulf simply hadn't been as crafty as he had believed. He rushed down the hall and toward an oblivious student, a second-year he vaguely knew.</p>

<p>"Run!" shouted Ulf, but the student just stood there, frozen. <em>She'll be killed</em>, thought Ulf, but as he rushed past, he realized that the student was weeping black tears. Oil.</p>

<p>The student threw herself at him. Ulf desperately dodged and continued running.</p>

<p>"Help!" he shouted. "Help!"</p>

<p>The student with the oily tears was gaining, and Brotten was close behind. Ulf felt the student's hand grasp his robe, and he turned long enough to lash out. She tripped and went down. Ulf dodged left and then right, put on a little burst of speed and then turned right again<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> only to realize the hallway terminated in a dead end.</p>

<p>He tried to turn back, but it was too late. She was blocking his way. A moment later, Brotten arrived as well.</p>

<p>"Stable boy," said Brotten as Ulf slowly backed away. Was there a way out? His mind raced as he tried to figure out what he could possibly do.</p>

<p>"I'll give you a choice," said Brotten. "I'm a kind man, even if, technically, I am more than a man." He stepped forward. "Either you can give up the book and die a clean, simple death, or you can refuse and be torn painfully apart." He took another step. "Either way, you die. But the second death, I guarantee, will be decidedly more painful."</p>

<p>"Take another step and I'll destroy the book," said Ulf.</p>

<p>Brotten smiled, though on his metal face the smile looked like a rictus of pain. "Perhaps that's precisely what we intend to do with it ourselves." Brotten took another step. "Give me the book."</p>

<p>"No," said Ulf. He closed his eyes and waited for the end to come.</p>

<p>But the end did not come. Instead, with a crash, the wall beside him burst apart. Dust and smoke filled the air, and through it appeared a hulking creature, humanoid but not human. He had the skin and scales of a lizard and the appearance of a dinosaur. A viashino. "Run!" he said to Ulf. "Find him! I'll hold them back as long as I can."</p>

<p>"Find who?" asked Ulf.</p>

<p>But the viashino had turned away. Glaring at Brotten, he hissed and sprang forward. The student stepped between him and Brotten, and with a bellow, the viashino batted her away.</p>

</figure>
</div>

<p>"No!" screamed Brotten to the student. "Keep with the book! Don't lose the fool!"</p>

<p>Injured, leaking oil from one side now, the student struggled to her feet. "Run!" the viashino shouted again, and this time Ulf did.</p>

<hr />
<p>It was better, he decided, to hide, and to hide in the place he knew best: the library. He wound his way through the stacks, passing a startled librarian, and rushed into the older, more poorly illuminated section. He slowed, began to walk quietly. Could he hide in the side room where he'd found the book? Too risky: he might have mentioned it to Brotten. Somewhere else, then.</p>

<p>And then he remembered the lower shelf that had been emptied of books on Corondor. He strode quickly there. Was there room enough to squeeze in? Yes, if he pushed some books down, moved a few elsewhere. He was small: there was just enough space for him to crawl in. He would be invisible to anybody not on hands and knees. Maybe that would be enough.</p>

<p>He lay there waiting, trying to breathe softly. How would he know when it was safe to come out? Surely by now others had noticed the disruption and were hurrying to defend the school from the Phyrexians.</p>

<p><em>Unless</em>, thought Ulf, <em>they're all Phyrexians</em>.</p>

<p>No, he couldn't think like that. That was paranoid. He had to trust there was someone still human out there.</p>

<p>He heard a noise in the stacks, an aisle or two away. He fell silent. Was he visible at all? No, he was okay. Nobody walking by would see him. He would be safe.</p>

<p>The footsteps receded for a moment and then returned, slowly growing stronger. They were in his aisle now. He held his breath. The noise grew louder and louder and then he saw a set of legs pass a few inches before his face and continue on.</p>

<p>He quietly exhaled, relaxed.</p>

<p>And then he heard the footsteps stop.</p>

<p>A moment later the student's oil-stained face was right there, staring at him. Matted now through her hair were the strands of cables that had forced their way out of her skin.</p>

<p>"Give me the book," the girl hissed.</p>

<p>The girl started to reach out and then, suddenly, reared up, her face vanishing. Another pair of legs was there. The student cried out. Her head fell to the floor and bounced, no longer attached. A few seconds later, her body followed, collapsing in a mass of flesh and wire.</p>

<p>Ulf gaped.</p>

<p>Quickly he scrambled out. Standing over the body of the student was a grizzled man. He had long brown hair streaked through with gray, his wrists wrapped in leather cuffs. He was strong, hulking even, and carried in one hand a sword that was meant for two. A swirling and fiery energy enwrapped the blade, from which dripped the oil once hidden inside the student's flesh. It sizzled on the strange metal. The man turned toward him, and Ulf saw on his right cheek just below his eye the Mark of the Elder Druid—that rare mark of distinction that Ulf thought he would never see. He had read about in researching Corondor, knew it was given only to a chosen few. But the only person he knew of with such a mark who looked like this and who carried a sword such as this hadn't been seen for many years<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> It couldn't be<nbsp> . . .</nbsp></p>

<p>"Thank you," Ulf managed.</p>

<p>There was a hint of sadness in the man's expression. "She was an innocent. She probably didn't even know what they'd implanted in her."</p>

<p>"Who are you?" asked Ulf.</p>

<p>"What?" said the man. And then he came out of his reverie and became gruff and ready. "I'm your rescuer," he said. He wiped his sword clean on the dead girl's robes and sheathed it. And then he roughly grabbed hold of Ulf.</p>

<p>"Hey, what are you doing?" said Ulf.</p>

<p>"Shut up and hold still," said the man. Rapidly, he ran his hands through Ulf's hair, patting down his shoulders, his sides, his arms, his legs. When he let go, he was holding what looked like a small metallic burr in his hand.</p>

<p>"I thought so," said the man. He dropped the burr to the ground and crushed it. "Tracker. They'll have a hard time finding you now." Grabbing Ulf by the arm, he propelled him forward.</p>

<p>"Get moving," he said. "We need to get out of here before it's too late."</p>

<hr />
<p>The man led him slowly through the stacks. "You have it, right?" he whispered.</p>

<p>"Have what?"</p>

<p>"The book. Why do you think we're here?"</p>

<p>Was it smart to admit he had it? Shouldn't he be cautious? "I<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> know where it is. Do you want it?"</p>

<p>"Want it? No, you keep it. I need to have my hands free," he said, and drew his sword. It looked terribly sharp. A student near the reference desk gave a yelp and sped away. "Besides," said the man. "They'll target whoever has the book. So, what say we let you hold on to it?"</p>

<p>"Um, thanks?" said Ulf.</p>

<p>Nobody was at the reference desk. Nearing the library door, the man waved to Ulf to stay back. He lay down on his belly and peered under the crack.</p>

<p>"Five sets of feet," he whispered when he got back up. "Waiting for us."</p>

<p>"What do we do?" asked Ulf.</p>

<p>"What do you think?" said the man. "We kill them."</p>

<p>"I don't know how to kill anybody," whispered Ulf.</p>

<p>The man looked him up and down. "Of course you don't," he said. "Don't worry: you'll learn."</p>

<hr />
<p class="rtecenter"><strong>III</strong></p>

<p>The Phyrexian sleeper agents waited, cables and metalwork sprouting from their bodies. One of them, an elf student, asked the one who had been his docent "Are you sure he's in there?"</p>

<p>"That's where he was when the tracker stopped working," she said.</p>

<p>"Do we really need to wait for Silas?" said another.</p>

<p>But nobody moved.</p>

<p>"Is there another way out of the library?" asked the elf.</p>

<p>"No," said the former docent. "I'm sure of it. They're trapped."</p>

<p>That was when the wall to one side of them exploded. Flames were everywhere, the whole corridor ignited, and three of the five were knocked off their feet. The other two rushed to the hole, weapons drawn. A moment later they fell back, dead, stabbed, and lay smoking.</p>

<p>Moaning, the remaining three got to their feet.</p>

<p>"I don't think we should look in the hole," the elf said.</p>

<p>"Let's wait," agreed the docent.</p>

<p>"Yes, let's," said a deep voice behind them. They spun around to find a man, his blade pulsing with flame, behind them. They fumbled for their weapons, but the man's spell was already cast, and the whole corridor ignited. For a moment, they thrashed around on fire, screaming, and then they fell still.</p>

<p>"Come on!" shouted the man. He headed down the other corridor. The fire behind them, Ulf saw, was out of control, beginning to spread.</p>

<p>"Shouldn't we try to put it out?" Ulf asked.</p>

<p>The man shook his head. "We need a good distraction."</p>

<p>They hurried along the halls, dodging into classrooms at any sign of someone approaching. Once, through a half-opened door, Ulf saw a creature that never could have been human, its body oddly gapped and rearranged. It was so tall its head scraped the ceiling. It made Ulf nauseous. The man waited until it passed, then rattled the door handle from the inside. In the corridor outside, they heard the creature stop, grunt. When it returned to open the door, the man cut its arm off, then stabbed the blade deep into its core and twisted. It collapsed in a shower of sparks and smoke.</p>

<p>They came across a stretch of broken and scorched hallway, the remnants of a battle. There, amid everything, lay the viashino who had saved Ulf. He was dead, his belly slit open. The man stood solemnly over him. "You fought honorably, old friend," he murmured, "I promise you it will not be in vain."</p>

<hr />
<p>The entrance hall was in sight at last. <em>We're almost safe</em>, Ulf thought. He started toward it, but the man grabbed his arm, stopped him.</p>

<p>"No," he growled, "Too easy. Something's wrong."</p>

<p>Instead, he opened a nearby classroom door and entered. He returned a moment later carrying a desk. One-handed, he tossed it into the space near the exit.</p>

<p>As soon as it touched the ground, it was sliced through with a dozen blades, reduced to flinders. A few stray blades ricocheted off the walls and came their way. As Ulf cowered, the man batted them easily aside with his sword.</p>

<p>"Told you," he said.</p>

<p>"So how do we get out?" asked Ulf, rising again.</p>

<p>The man shrugged. "Rune's discharged. It's fine now." He looked at Ulf. "Can't you feel it?" When Ulf shook his head, the man narrowed his eyes. "You really don't have much magical ability, do you? Are you sure you belong in a magic program at a Tolarian academy?"</p>

<p>"I<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> I'm a good researcher." He watched the man's hand come around to rest on his sword's pommel.</p>

<p>"If you're one of those damned sleeper agents, I'll personally make sure you're cut into more bits than that desk was. Tell me the truth. Why are you really here?"</p>

<p>"I think they wanted someone to clean out the stables."</p>

<p>The man relaxed. "Makes sense. Last thing most mages want is to get their hands dirty."</p>

<hr />
<p>They made their way through the door into the vestibule, only to find someone awaiting them.</p>

<p>"Silas Brotten," the man said. "I can't say I'm surprised. Take the book, but let the boy go."</p>

<p>"Jared Carthalion," said Brotten, and with a shock, Ulf realized he had been right. "Can it be? I don't care about the book <em>or </em>the boy now that you're here. You were always the prize, Carthalion. And now I don't need any help finding you."</p>

<p>Jared cast Ulf a quick glance, and Ulf saw something different in it this time, a measure of curiosity. "You can't have the boy and you can't have me," Jared said. And he drew his sword.</p>

</figure>
</div>

<p>Ulf watched Jared's sword flash, watched too Brotten's shoulders bristle as sudden internal armor thrust to the surface. Brotten touched his chest, and a long curved barbed slice of metal suddenly jutted out. He closed his hand over it and wrenched it free. It continued to unfold and articulate to become a barbed, ornate sword.</p>

<p>They fought back and forth, Jared the superior fighter, but Brotten just able to hold his own and, because of his machine components, not grow tired. They circled one another warily, and then closed, Carthalion uttering a fierce battle cry as he rushed forward, driving Brotten back toward the wall. He almost had him there, was forcing his advantage, when Ulf saw something strange: Brotten's thigh had begun to split open.</p>

<p>"His leg!" Ulf called, and Jared had enough presence of mind to leap back just as a circular metal blade spun out of the leg, traveling at immense speed. It sliced the edge of Jared's thigh: had he not leaped back, it would have cut him in half. Jared pressed his hand to the wound to staunch the blood, and suddenly Brotten was pressing his advantage, forcing him back.</p>

<p>Ulf kept expecting to see Jared go down, but the man fought on. It would be wiser, he knew, to flee, but he had helped save Jared once. If he left, who would save him the next time?</p>

<p>Another flurry of attacks and counterattacks made clear that even with blood coursing down his thigh, Jared was still the more skillful. Brotten cursed and brought his blade down hard, an attack Jared blocked by bringing his up with just as much force. Brotten's blade shattered, and Jared drove his sword past the guard of the broken blade and into Brotten's chest.</p>

<p>Stumbling, coughing oil, Brotten collapsed face down.</p>

<p>Still breathing hard, Jared rolled him over with his boot and bent down over him.</p>

<p>"Why did Sheoldred send you here?" Jared said.</p>

<p>Brotten just gave a bubbling laugh.</p>

<p>"Who are the other agents at the school? Who else has already been compleated?"</p>

<p>"Why would I tell you that?" mumbled Brotten.</p>

<p>"Does it go all the way to the archmage? Is he himself corrupted?"</p>

<p>"He's as human as you, Carthalion. There are plenty of reasons to choose the winning side."</p>

<p>Brotten reached toward Jared, but Jared idly batted his hand away. "Dihada knows that, too," said Brotten. "She's waiting for you, Jared. Return to her."</p>

<p>And then he grinned, showing oil-soaked artificial teeth, and died.</p>

<hr />
<p>At last, Ulf approached, staring at the remnants of the being who had tried to destroy him. He looked now like little more than a broken machine. Jared had torn a strip from Brotten's clothing, was using it to bind his thigh. The blood had already begun to soak through.</p>

<p>"Where are we going?" Ulf asked.</p>

<p>"<em>We</em> are not going anywhere," said Jared. He sounded tired. "You will take the book to safety. Bring it to Corondor. There are still good people there. I'll meet you there." He gestured behind him. "My work is back inside. I need to save those who are still human and kill those who aren't." He looked at Ulf. "Stay away from main roads and show this book to nobody."</p>

<p>For a moment, they stood staring at one another, and then Ulf nodded. "Thank you," he said. Jared answered with a simple nod back. Then he turned and limped back into the now ruined academy.</p>

<p>Ulf took a deep breath. And then he stepped through the gates and out into the world.</p>

<hr />
<p class="rtecenter"><strong>IV</strong></p>

<p>Deep within the Lat-Nam academy, behind the locked doors of his quarters, the archmage gave a malicious smile. He shivered all over and slowly, he began to change, his stout body growing thinner, stretching, rearranging, until it had become the body of a gray-skinned woman. Or, at least, the body of a woman on top. Below, tentacles curled and contorted, writhing along the floor.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said. "How <em>lucky </em>you found the book, Jared. Once you've played the hero here yet again, Corondor will be waiting for you."</p>

The creature squealed, spurting black glistening oil from its octopoidal body, writhing in anger. Karn observed its thrashing with dispassion.</p>

<p>"It's the second saboteur I've found." Teferi managed the troops, acting as both a general and a quartermaster—no easy task in the new Coalition, where so many species acted in concert as allies.</p>

<p>"What damage did it do?" Karn asked.</p>

<p>"It was in the food stores," Teferi said. "Jhoira is checking them for corruption, but until they're cleared, dinner is off. You can imagine how our troops feel about that."</p>

<p>Karn only understood organic beings' relationship to food in abstract terms, but he'd witnessed how missing even a single meal could cause Jhoira to become irritable, even when starvation had not been at issue. Imagining that on a grander scale<nbsp> . . .</nbsp></p>

<p>"Is this interrupting Jhoira's progress?" Had the creature found the food stores accidentally? Or had the spy given their location to Sheoldred? Karn had been unable to determine the spy's identity; Jaya, Jodah, and Ajani had yet to arrive, and he expected that they would be able to help once they did. Jhoira had occupied herself with setting up the self-destruct mechanism on the Mana Rig's helm, a priority now that Sheoldred's troops had begun to mass. They would not permit Sheoldred to obtain and convert the Mana Rig. If she did, she would be able to create powerstones and apply Thran steel, which was nearly indestructible, to her monstrous creations.</p>

<p>Teferi shook his head. "It's installed, and she's currently linking the cannons into the Mana Rig's power supply."</p>

<p>Pinned and writhing as the monstrosity was, Karn did not know what information it could transmit to Sheoldred. He placed one hand on it, removed the blade, and tossed the creature into a crucible. It writhed, hissing as its blood boiled, its oil conflagrated, its flesh cooked, and its metal melted.</p>

<p>"Your work on the sylex?" Teferi looked worried. He shifted his shoulders beneath his breastplate. A buckle had come loose, but due to his still-healing injuries, he could not reach around to adjust it.</p>

<p>Finished. Karn had determined how to activate it. But he hesitated to say so aloud. What if it was not a spy that Karn needed to seek but a spying device, hidden somewhere aboard the Mana Rig? He stepped forward and tightened Teferi's breastplate, glad he had no need of such accoutrements. Organic beings' torsos being gigantic buckets for their organs was an obvious design flaw. "Please be still. I cannot risk harm coming to you due to badly fitting armor."</p>

<p>"It was too easy, to think of you as a thing, while watching you being built." Teferi bowed his head. "For what it's worth, Karn, I apologize for how I treated you in the past."</p>

<p>"I accept your apology."</p>

<p>A klaxon blared above decks, summoning the troops to fight.</p>

<p>Teferi broke out into a jog, and Karn followed him onto the upper deck. Since Jhoira's workshop was located at the prow, from here Karn could see the entire Mana Rig. The lower decks looked like a split globe; the two hemispheres joined with an assembly that supported the Mana Rig's legs. Although Karn could not see them from his vantage, he knew they clamped down onto the red desert rocks, fixing the Mana Rig to the cliffside; similarly, the distant stern hemisphere was connected to the mountains of Shiv by a jury-rigged bridge. City buildings rose from both decks. Above him, the upper decks climbed toward the helm, located in an outcropping that overlooked the front hemisphere. Goblins and viashino disassembled food stalls wedged between the buildings and rolled out siege machinery to replace them: mana cannons hung over the sides, pointed at the desert below.</p>

<p>The desert seethed. The Phyrexians beneath the Mana Rig were so numerous they resembled an iridescent pool in the bright Shivan light. Its surface heaved like a sea about to be breached by a whale, rippled, and then broke as an immense monstrosity arose from its depths.</p>

<p>This was not another sortie.</p>

<p>Teferi roared, "Status of the cannons?"</p>

<p>"Not ready!" one woman shouted.</p>

<p>The first wave of Phyrexians scaled the Mana Rig's sides. Coalition fighters shoved back their ladders, chopped off grappling hooks, and jabbed spears into the twisted beasts.</p>

<p>A Phyrexian dreadnought lifted itself from the horde, whale-like in its immensity—only no whale Karn had ever seen possessed a centipede's legs or mandibles. Stones plinked from its glistening black body and small fibers writhed out from its armor plates as if tasting the air. It lumbered toward the Mana Rig, its mandibles clacking.</p>

<p>"Nine Hells," Teferi muttered. "Aim for the dreadnought—for its thorax! Hold until you're ready to activate the cannons."</p>

<p>Jhoira emerged from the lower decks, two human technologists at her heels. She rushed to the cannons and knelt, checking the final connections. Her assistants seated themselves behind the cannons, wheeling them to face the dreadnought. The cannons accumulated power, their snouts wreathed in burning blue energy.</p>

<p>Jhoira waved. "Fire!"</p>

<div class="figure-wrapper">

</figure>
</div>

<p>The cannons released a crackling blast that slammed into the Phyrexian's thorax, charring the metal and rocking it back into its own army. Blue energy burned between its armor plates. Jhoira waved again, and the cannons blasted the dreadnought a second time, ripping through its weakened armor. It collapsed onto its own troops, crushing them.</p>

<p>"Well," Jhoira said, "those are working."</p>

<p>A shadow passed along the Mana Rig's decks. The <em>Weatherlight</em> soared above, and for a moment, Karn felt relief—until he saw it loose a salvo at a cluster of viashino, sending them scattering.</p>

<p>"Oh no," he muttered. Now, looking closer, he could see that the coils and tendrils that had previously served as camouflage were no longer dead and inert. Even its cockpit was crusted over, blood and gore dried into a leathery coating over what had once been shining glass. The Phyrexians had compleated the <em>Weatherlight</em>.</p>

<div class="figure-wrapper">

</figure>
</div>

<p>The ship swooped low, dropping twisted horrors from its decks—some small as cats, others lumbering and bear-like in their bulk, interspersed with the compleated humans. Sheoldred must be hoping to overwhelm them, Karn thought, before Jhoira finished installing the self-destruct mechanism on the Mana Rig. If these Phyrexians attacked Teferi and the viashino from the back, the cannons would be left undefended.</p>

<p>Karn moved to meet them. A humanoid Phyrexian leaped from the <em>Weatherlight</em>'s deck onto the Mana Rig, silhouette strange yet familiar. He walked toward Karn, his doubled-up arms raised. His pale hair, laden with metal spikes, was slicked back, and his eyes dripped black oil down his cheeks. He stretched his mouth into a grin directed at Karn. "It's been quite some time, old friend."</p>

<p>It couldn't be—yet it was. Ertai.</p>

<p>Karn had thought him dead. Whatever techniques the Phyrexians had used to revivify him after all these centuries had left what made him <em>him</em> intact: how he set his shoulders, how he narrowed his eyes at Karn, how he flexed his hands; these mannerisms remained the same.</p>

<p>High above, dark specks in the blue resolved themselves into dragons, diving for the compleated <em>Weatherlight</em>. The airship pivoted and gained altitude to engage the dragons, narrowly avoiding a gout of flame. Darigaaz threw himself at the <em>Weatherlight</em>'s hull, clinging to the airship so that it wallowed in the sky. He used his back claws to rake the <em>Weatherlight</em>'s draping intestinal cables like a cat gutting a rabbit.</p>

<p>Karn faced Ertai.</p>

<p>Ertai opened his doubled arms in mock welcome. "It's been so long since the<em> Weatherlight</em> left me for dead. You all could have come back for me. But you did not. And now look at who captains it—a neat twist of fate."</p>

<p>"Not fate," said Karn, simply. "Her design."</p>

<p>"She may think you're special, Karn," Ertai said, "but I know the truth. Anything that has been built can be disassembled."</p>

<p>Ertai smiled and drew doubled arcs with his four hands, inscribing the dust-choked air with glowing magic. Karn advanced on him, and Ertai, with a flick of his wrists, shot the spell forward faster than throwing knives. The glimmering light struck Karn. He expected it to bounce from his body, repelled by the careful wards Karn had enchanted himself with, but it felt as though he had rusted solid, his joints rendered suddenly nonfunctional.</p>

<p>"I've had time to think about this during my revival," Ertai said. "Time to plan, to redesign myself so that I could fight<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> you."</p>

<p>"What—have—you—done?" Karn grated out.</p>

<p>Ertai lifted his doubled arms, drawing Karn into the air as if Karn weighed no more than a piece of dandelion fluff. That grasp tightened, squeezing. If Karn had been a being with lungs, he would have passed out. He clenched his jaw against it, but that gave him no relief from the agony that pulsed through him, emanating from his plating. His metal body made a crumpling sound, denting beneath the pressure. Ertai opened his hands, slowly—finger by finger, unfurling his fists, but he did not release Karn.</p>

<p>"You'll be unrecognizable," Ertai said. "Beautiful, and new."</p>

<p>Frost bloomed over Karn's body, a white sheen that coated his metal. He cooled. He could feel the metal contracting, stressed by the temperature difference between the Shivan desert heat and the magical ice. Ertai twisted his hands, a wringing gesture, then drew them apart. The tension changed from compression to a stretching as Ertai drew Karn's limbs away from his body. He was pulling Karn apart, limb by limb, like a cruel child torturing an insect. Karn's joints torqued under the pressure. Metal gave way in Karn's shoulders and his knees, the joints bent and mangled.</p>

<p>What would it be like to die?</p>

<p>Karn had never contemplated it—not as a realistic option for him. Death was something that happened to other people, a tragedy that he inevitably survived, and thought that he would always survive again. He had no way to fight this, no way to stop Ertai that he could think of—and the Mana Rig was being overrun.</p>

<p>He would not like to die.</p>

<p>Ertai grinned. The pressure intensified.</p>

<p>If he was to die, he would first protect the sylex. Karn reached into the Blind Eternities, into the hum he associated with its magic, and drew forth particles of the hardest material he could generate. He visualized the distant sylex, in Jhoira's workshop. He'd never generated material at such a distance from his body. But he forced it, hoping he'd get it right. He spun the densest carbon filaments he could from the aether and encased the sylex in its lockbox in titanium. He wove those filaments around the lockbox into an impenetrable mass. From this distance, it took tremendous will. He focused hard on the act of creation rather than the sense of torsion in his body.</p>

<p>A roar—like an excavator breaking stone.</p>

<p>The <em>Golden Argosy </em>swept through the Shiv's red mountains, stone churning in its wake, and drew abreast of the Mana Rig.</p>

<p>Ajani leaped from the <em>Argosy</em>'s decks, dropping down behind Ertai. In one smooth motion, he drew his double-bladed axe from his back and swung at Ertai. The Phyrexian mage stumbled backwards, concentration broken—and with a scream, tumbled over the side of the Mana Rig.</p>

<p>The magic gripping Karn eased, and he dropped to his feet. His knees gave way, and he fell. He was too damaged to stand.</p>

<p>Ajani, his teeth bared, swung his axe down in a low salute. "I have returned to fight at your side, my friend."</p>

<p>Karn, creaky from the intense pressures, inclined his head. He was glad he could do that much: he was no longer in fighting condition. "And I am glad for it. We must defend Jhoira's workshop."</p>

<p>"Her workshop?" Ajani asked. "What of the helm?"</p>

<p>"Jhoira can hold it." Karn nodded at the helm, where it overlooked the decks, high above and a good distance from the fight. "The sylex. The sylex is in her workshop."</p>

<p>With a savage growl in reply, Ajani turned and laid into the Phyrexians.</p>

<p>Grappling hooks launched from the <em>Golden Argosy </em>as it drew in close to the Mana Rig. The Phyrexians still climbing the sides were crushed as the <em>Golden Argosy </em>ground into position alongside the Mana Rig's stern section. The crew from the <em>Argosy </em>threw planks across to bridge the gap, and Jaya led the charge, followed by Danitha Capashen in her house's colors and Radha with her people's battle cry on her lips. Keldon warriors and Benalish knights poured from the <em>Argosy</em> onto the Mana Rig's decks. They laid into the Phyrexians with their massive blades, cleaving the creatures into spare parts.</p>

</div>

<p>Jaya raised a curtain of flame and drew it along the decks, herding the Phyrexians toward the <em>Argosy </em>and her troops. "Karn! How do you like your interplanar nightmares cooked?"</p>

<p>"I do not require nutritional sustenance," Karn said.</p>

<p>She rolled her eyes and drew up arcs of fire. "I'm unappreciated in my time." The scarlet blaze whirled around her like blades, cutting into Phyrexian monstrosities. She lifted her hand, fingers clawed with effort, and electricity began to coalesce around her. With a great boom, a bolt of lightning coursed through the enemy ranks. Apparently, Karn was staring; when she next turned to him, she grinned. "What? I learned some new tricks."</p>

<p>Behind them, over the edge of the Mana Rig, a vast and burnished viridian shape rose from the desert sands far below. That visage, those branching horns—Karn knew them too well. Sheoldred, affixed now to some nightmarish construct from the ancient wars of Dominaria. It brought her small human torso level with the Mana Rig.</p>

<p>"Karn." When Sheoldred spoke, her entire body resonated and her voice filled the battlefield, melodious, with strange harmonics. "You have the sylex for me."</p>

<p>Karn's plan to use the sylex to draw Sheoldred out had worked.</p>

<p>"Jaya, go to the workshop and get the sylex," Ajani said. "We must get it away."</p>

<p>Jaya nodded. Covering her own retreat with flares of fire, she backed into the workshop. Ajani and Teferi both flanked the doorway.</p>

<p>Sheoldred moved forward, not so much striding with her many legs as swimming through her army, gathering monstrosities into her body and incorporating them into herself as she went. She approached the Mana Rig from the side. Cannon fire rained down against her iron shell but sheeted from her body. It did not damage her.</p>

<p>Was she going for the joint between the Mana Rig's sections?</p>

<p>But Sheoldred opened the mandibles on her dragon engine body and slammed her chest into the Mana Rig's bow section like a battering ram. The thud boomed through the Mana Rig. From the hull, metal grated on metal, the vibrations traveling through the entire rig. She extended her legs out into the Phyrexian army. Her writhing fibers withdrew into herself as her army swarmed up her body, using her legs as ladders and her dragon engine body as a ramp onto the Mana Rig's upper deck.</p>

<p>Karn hunkered down in front of the workshop door. Why hadn't Jaya planeswalked away with the sylex yet? Karn's damaged fingers were too bent for him to make fists, so he crushed Phyrexians between his palms, cognizant of two Planeswalkers fighting behind him. He had to protect Ajani and Teferi as best as he could. He could not help but admire how Teferi fought: not only with a Planeswalker's determination but a father's. He was a man who'd decided to save his daughter's plane, and his own. Yet even as Karn threw aside a monstrosity that looked like an assemblage of human, horse, and squid, he also remained aware of Ajani. He had to stay far enough forward to remain clear of Ajani's arcing blows. Ajani could spin that double-headed axe and sweep it through metal and flesh alike so smoothly that it took the Phyrexians a moment to consider what, exactly, was wrong before they slid apart. From the Phyrexian army's rear, reinforcements emerged—not, Karn thought, that they needed them: two more dreadnoughts. Immense metal plates covered their cables, pulsing organs, and flesh, bristling with spikes large enough to spear three people through. The dreadnoughts lumbered forward on their study legs.</p>

<p>"Nine Hells<nbsp> . . .</nbsp>" Teferi breathed, behind Karn. He bellowed, "Ready the cannons!"</p>

<p>"I don't know how we will emerge from this victorious," Ajani said.</p>

<p>On the horizon, a shadow deepened—a line of sudden and towering green. It almost looked to Karn like the edge of a forest.</p>

<p>High above, Darigaaz led his dragons into a wheeled dive at the dreadnoughts. Darigaaz slammed his bulk into one of them and began to wrestle it apart, plate by plate. The <em>Weatherlight</em> pivoted in pursuit, its bat-like sails dexterous in Shiv's winds, harrying the dragons with sickly green blasts of light.</p>

<p>The Mana Rig shuddered, then thrummed. Karn could feel the heartstone in his core hum in response, a call and answer, like the beginning of a duet. Jhoira must have completed her work, and she'd woken the Mana Rig. It stood: slow, inexorable.</p>

<p>Everyone on deck—even the Phyrexians—stopped fighting to regain their balance, swaying as the Mana Rig lifted itself to its feet. Karn could feel his body press harder into the decking, the airflow squeaking through his damaged joints, clean and hot in comparison to the battle's filth. It hurt his dented metal plating. The remnants of the bridge connecting the Mana Rig to the desert tore away. Sheoldred's mandibles screeched down the Mana Rig's length, and Karn could feel the entire structure lurch as she lost her grip on its hull.</p>

<p>The Mana Rig was free.</p>

<p>Sheoldred tipped, her balance disrupted.</p>

<p>The Mana Rig strode forward along the rocky desert landscape, not graceful but efficient, well-balanced, crushing Phyrexians beneath it. It scooped up rock as it went and spewed molten lava across the seething Phyrexian army. Karn could not see the details, but he could see the results: withering masses, shrinking as they burned, soon submerged under thick waves of molten rock.</p>

<p>The Phyrexian army began to pull back—but the dark cloud Karn had spotted on the horizon had resolved itself into foliage and trees: rank upon rank of Magnigoths marched forward, darkening Shiv's deserts with their cool shadows and verdant foliage. The Mana Rig's lava drove the Phyrexians beneath the Magnigoths' branches. The Magnigoths tore into them—and Yavimayan elves, vibrant as bromeliads upon the Magnigoths' limbs, rained down arrows at the monstrosities beneath.</p>

<p>A flighted kavu glided onto the deck, and Jodah sprang from its back. An elf with pale skin and dapples across her cheeks tumbled off after him. Meria. Jodah had told him of her. "So many Planeswalkers," she said. "It's an honor to fight alongside you all. And the Mana Rig is even bigger than I imagined!"</p>

<p>All around the deck, more gliding kavu dropped down, Yavimayan elves upon their backs. The fighting reignited as the Yavimayan elves charged the Phyrexians, spearing them through and freeing up the beleaguered defenders. Jodah raised a searing white light, enveloping the cannons and their operators in protective shields to buy them the time they needed to work their weapons. Cannons blasted the larger Phyrexians, knocking them out before they could attempt to breach the Mana Rig's defenses. Meria fell in beside Radha and Danitha, coordinating her troops so that the Yavimayan archers formed up behind the Benalish and Keldon warriors. Waves of arrows arced over the Keldons and Benalish, studding the oncoming monstrosities.</p>

<p>"We're<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> saved," Teferi murmured.</p>

<p>From the tone of his voice, he had not thought reprieve possible. Neither had Karn.</p>

<p>Jaya emerged from Jhoira's workshop, stepping out into the space between Teferi and Ajani. In her arms, she held the titanium lump Karn had generated around the sylex. Her teeth were gritted as she lugged it out. It had not occurred to Karn that an object of that size and weight might be difficult for a human to maneuver.</p>

<p>"I can't bring it through the Blind Eternities alone," Jaya admitted. "It's too heavy for me to planeswalk with."</p>

<p>Karn nodded. He passed his bent hands over the case, stripping off its protective metal coating. Then he waved again, and the lockless chest opened. The sylex gleamed in its box. It alone would be light enough for Jaya to carry.</p>

<p>"Finally." Ajani's voice sounded distorted, not with bloodlust's growl, but<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> mechanical.</p>

<p>Karn turned toward his friend.</p>

<p>Ajani bared his teeth in an agonized grimace. He flattened his ears and clenched his good eye shut. His skin undulated, as if worms crawled beneath his fur's surface.</p>

<p>Jaya made a noise of disbelief. Teferi stepped forward. No—Ajani couldn't be—</p>

<p>Ajani's good eye widened with horror. He shook his head in denial and mouthed <em>no, no, no </em>gripping his own arms as if he could restrain the Phyrexian fibers beneath his skin and prevent them from emerging. But they engorged, ripping open muscle and fur, to reveal a sleek, dense Phyrexian musculature that had been installed beneath his own.</p>

</div>

<p>Ajani had been compleated. <em>He</em> was the spy, the traitor. He'd betrayed them to Sheoldred.</p>

<p>Jaya clutched the sylex protectively to her chest. Still stunned, she took one step back, retreating toward the workshop. Fire flared around her, encircling her. This motion seemed to trigger Ajani. He swept up his axe and drove into her body. Jaya's back arched, and her mouth gaped in pain. She fell.</p>

<p>Teferi raised his hands, his magic slowing Ajani's attack. Karn rushed the leonin. placing himself in front of Jaya, hoping that someone, anyone, could place a healing spell on her prone body. Ajani swung the axe into Karn's torso. Karn expected the blade to skid from his metal body, but it cut into him deeply, like he was no more than meat. Pain radiated up from the wound. Karn gripped the axe's handle and tried to wrestle it free, but the blade had embedded into him. Ajani effortlessly passed him by, Teferi too drained to slow him any longer.</p>

<p>"Sheoldred calculated your strength well." The mechanical voice emanating from Ajani's throat sounded nothing like his usual growl. "The sylex and Karn: two of the artifacts the Whispering One wished to obtain on Dominaria."</p>

<p>"You'd—have—to—kill me," Jaya gasped, "before I'd let you—"</p>

<p>"Yes," Ajani said, simply, hoisting her into the air with one hand. "You are dying."</p>

<p>Jaya coughed. "Maybe. But not alone." Fire poured outward from Jaya's body, a white and scarlet conflagration; Ajani snarled and leaned back, his fur burning away to reveal blackened wires and cables below the skin, the air filling with the reek of charred oil. With a thrust of his ruined hand, he hurled Jaya over the edge of the Mana Rig.</p>

</div>

<p>Teferi gasped. Jodah raised a frail cry.</p>

<p>Karn tried to remove Ajani's axe from his body, but his damaged joints bent under the pressure and the blade did not budge. The sylex was so close—right in front of him, where Jaya had dropped it. He'd avenge her, he'd—but Ajani had been right: Sheoldred had calculated his strength perfectly. Perhaps he'd given away more of himself in the Caves of Koilos than he'd known. Ajani put his arm around Karn in a parody of friendship, gathering Karn to himself. With the other hand, he lifted the sylex—and crumpled it in his hand, as if the ancient artifact were made of nothing more than paper. Karn could only watch in horror as the intricate runes lining the device flashed briefly, then died.</p>

<p>Sheoldred slammed into the Mana Rig, halting its advance and crunching it between herself and a mountain, the impact rattling throughout the massive artifact's hull. The battle's tide turned yet again as Phyrexians dropped down from the mountainside onto the decks. Benalish, Keldons, Yavimayan elves, goblins, humans, and viashino now fought, hard-pressed.</p>

<p>Karn struggled against Ajani's grip. Jodah and Teferi stood stunned. It had all happened within seconds.</p>

<p>Sheoldred split apart, her small humanoid half popping itself off its massive dragon engine host body, revealing a snake-like spine that she used for her insertion into her larger host body. Her humanoid part slithered down her massive torso and dove onto the Mana Rig's decks. She moved toward the Planeswalkers. Her horned helmet folded back—it did not show the gore and metal Karn expected but rather pallid skin. Sheoldred revealed a fine nose, full lips, and large dark sorrowful eyes, like a doe's. No doubt she had harvested her face from some poor woman, long dead.</p>

<p>She pressed one small, pale hand to Karn's chest. "I have the Mana Rig. I have you. Dominaria is vulnerable to invasion. All the wonders of my people will become your wonders. All our beauty will become your beauty. There is only one truth. The next step in evolution will be compleated."</p>

<p>All around the battlefield, Phyrexians murmured, "There is only one truth." The murmur rose from the ranks, softer than a wind from distorted mouths, and far more eerie.</p>

<p>"It did not happen like I planned it, Karn, thanks to your efforts." She clutched the chain around Karn's neck that held his scrying device, locator, and the gadget he'd used to communicate with the <em>Weatherlight</em>. "No, this is <em>better</em>. I do have a plan, Karn. A plan for you—and for Dominaria. For all the planes."</p>

<p>"I guess you're going to be disappointed," Jhoira's words boomed, amplified by the rig's structure, "because you won't get what you want today." A long pause—as if Jhoira had to force herself to do what she knew was right. But Karn believed in her. Then, an ominous ticking emanated from the Mana Rig's central structure. Jhoira had triggered the Mana Rig's self-destruct mechanism.</p>

<p>The <em>Golden Argosy</em> broke away, racing into the sands.</p>

<p>"Jodah," Jhoira shouted, "portal everyone out of here! Now!"</p>

<p>Jodah wrenched himself to his feet. Around the Mana Rig's decks, portals whirled into existence, swallowing up nearby troops. The gaping soldiers who weren't sucked in got shoved through by friends quicker to understand what was about to happen. Jodah pulled up a portal and threw Danitha, Radha, and Meria into it, shifting them to a safe location away from the blast radius. He even ensured that Meria's precious kavu would not be left behind, enveloping it in a whirling portal. Lastly, Jodah looked at Karn. His eyes bright with regret, he stepped back through his final portal.</p>

<p>The decks grew eerily quiet: Sheoldred with her stolen face unmoved, Ajani controlled, his arm a skeletal and charred ruin where Jaya had burned him.</p>

<p>Karn waited.</p>

<p>"I've acquired the targets. I am ready to return." Sheoldred exhaled—Karn could not tell if she sighed with disappointment or satisfaction—and a scarlet light, at first only the size of a bead, materialized in the air behind her. Lightning threaded it as that light expanded into a shining, whirling scarlet globe. It roared with power, eating into the air and environment around it. It grew toward them, gnawing at the atmosphere.</p>

<p>Sheoldred tilted her head and touched her face. "What a shame. I liked this one."</p>

<p>Karn struggled against Ajani's grip, but between his damaged body and Ajani's enhanced strength, he could not free himself. The ugly red light engulfed Sheoldred. She turned her face into its power with a small gasp as it washed over her. Its blaze burned over Ajani and Karn. Searingly hot, Karn could feel how it tugged at him, the very essence of what made him <em>Karn</em>, and it<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> stole him away.</p>

<p>Like he was nothing more than an artifact. The object of a theft.</p>

<hr />
<p>As night cooled the desert air, Jhoira and Teferi finished coordinating the survivors: he had set up the triage tents, she had placed the few able-bodied reserves to search the battlefield for survivors and burn the Phyrexian dead, and then they both had worked with the goblin and viashino civilians—there had been a few who refused to leave their homes and evacuate—to inventory supplies, set up the camp beneath the Magnigoths' sheltering limbs, and ensure everyone was fed according to their need.</p>

<p>They were both exhausted.</p>

<p>Speaking to Jodah<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> After all that, Teferi did not know if he had the strength.</p>

<p>But he summoned it from some deep reserve. It was what Niambi would have him do.</p>

<p>Jodah knelt on an outcropping, dry-eyed and surveying the battlefield's devastation: the troops picking amongst the survivors, scattering vultures; the banks of black lava, steaming into the deepening night. He held, cradled in his hands, Karn's necklace: the scryer, the Phyrexian locator, the <em>Weatherlight</em> communicator—and a lock of Jaya's white hair.</p>

<p>"Come." Teferi crouched beside him. "You must eat and sleep."</p>

<p>Jodah popped open the scryer's back and placed Jaya's hair into it like a locket. "I can't let go of her. I just got her back again. She can't be gone. Not yet. I have known her across lifetimes, and we still didn't have enough time together."</p>

<p>Teferi felt a vast emptiness inside himself: he didn't have enough energy to hurt. He recognized it well—he had retained this numbness after Subira had died. It had taken years for the edges to wear away, to reveal enough rawness for him to grieve. He had mourned her for a long time. He always would. She'd been the love of his life, and the mother of his child.</p>

<p>Jhoira joined them, her boots crunching across the gravel. "We still have living friends who need us, Jodah. What are Sheoldred's plans? What will she do with Karn and Ajani?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," Jodah said. "How can we fight them without the sylex?"</p>

<p>Jhoira sat beside Jodah, cross-legged, and put her arm around Jodah's shoulders.</p>

<p>Teferi contemplated the landscape. "We will build Jaya a memorial that will outlast the ages. Her strengths, her achievements, her wonders will not be forgotten. Shiv will become a site of pilgrimage."</p>

<p>Jodah only shook his head.</p>

<p>"I'll stay with him," Jhoira said.</p>

<hr />
<p>The stones rose from Shiv's red sands, an arrangement of white pyramids around an ever-burning fire that hovered midair. Jodah had set that spell himself. In the right light, when Shiv's winds hit it, the flame resembled a woman turning away to hide her smirk, her pale hair streaming into nothingness.</p>

<p>Danitha, Radha, and Meria had all returned to their homelands so that their devastated forces could recover, and so they could recruit more troops for the inevitable Phyrexian return. Jodah, Teferi, and Jhoira had remained to build this: a monument for Jaya.</p>

<p>Teferi would miss her.</p>

<p>"Jaya and I met when she was<nbsp> . . .</nbsp>" Jodah pinched the bridge of his nose and closed his eyes as if to hide their brightness. He swallowed. "Dominaria lost a mage—the realms lost—I lost—I'm sorry."</p>

<p>Jhoira rested her hand on Jodah's shoulder, and Jodah leaned into that old familiarity.</p>

<p>"I never thought I'd have to do this," Jodah finally said.</p>

<p>Teferi cleared his throat but didn't speak. He only shook his head, unable to put into words how much he'd miss her wit, the humor she brought to such serious tasks. Jaya couldn't save a plane without making a quip about it. He had imbued memories of her in one of the stone pyramids: her patience with teaching Chandra, how she'd smile just before saying something really cutting, and how they'd met. He'd never forget the day in Zhalfir when he'd mistaken her for a line cook and asked her for a fried egg. She, grinning, had gone behind the counter to oblige and lit all the burners with a flick of her fingers—much to the actual stall keeper's surprise. "You want some chutney with that?" He'd never forget her.</p>

<p>Teferi walked in a circle around the monument. Sweat bloomed on his skin, and he wiped away the beads on his forehead. He paused to touch the empty pyramid they'd left for Karn to instill with his memories of Jaya if he—no, <em>once</em> he returned.</p>

<p>Teferi straightened his shoulders. Saheeli waited at a respectful distance, her jewel-toned clothing flickering in the wind, the gold accents winking, her brown skin burnished and her black hair slipping down. At his <em>I'm-ready </em>nod, she turned, and they left together.</p>

<hr />
<p>When Teferi stepped through the portcullis, he had to suppress a shudder. They had reached it—Urza's tower. It was more than the worn flagstone emanating the previous night's chill. He never thought he would step into this place again.</p>

<p>Saheeli brought him to an ancient barrel-vaulted hall with its roof still intact, well protected from the sun. She rested a hand on her device, which Teferi would use to heighten his magic's strength and precision. He was not eager to climb into it: with its platform, its leather straps and wires, it resembled a device found in a dungeon to elicit confessions, not a magical item made to heighten a Planeswalker's innate talents.</p>

<p>While the clay tablet Karn had found in the Caves of Koilos had been lost, his drawings had not. Jaya had grabbed them when she'd grabbed the sylex. But unlike the sylex, the drawings had remained on Jaya's body, hidden in a secret pocket in her clothes.</p>

<p>Saheeli hadn't been able to determine <em>how</em> they described the sylex's workings. Only Karn had figured that out. But she had been able to determine <em>when </em>the sylex had been fired—and made a perfect replica of her own.</p>

<p>So this was now Teferi's mission: to return to the <em>when</em> to learn what Karn had already determined: the <em>how</em>. How did one activate it?</p>

<p>"Good luck, Teferi," said Saheeli. "For all our sakes."</p>

<p>He forced himself to relax. A small brown songbird perched in an arched window, then dropped down onto the floor to bathe in the dust. Karn would have known its species, its habits.</p>

<p>To save his home, to save the Multiverse, Teferi would do the one thing he had vowed never to do: cross time itself.</p>

<hr />
<p>The Planar Bridge's red light faded. Karn gathered, from the chitters echoing throughout the darkness, that he stood in a vast cavern. He could sense mineral deposits, the weight of quartz stalactites overhead, and he could smell cold, damp stone. He felt ill—wrong—as if the turbulent passage through the Blind Eternities had coated his metal surface in an unclean film. He knelt, his crumpled body still aching from the battle on the Mana Rig's deck. He hoped the others, Jodah, Jhoira, Teferi, had fared better than he, and Jaya<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> no, better not to think of that. Not until he could mourn.</p>

<p>White light flared, overwhelming his senses. The chittering noises stopped.</p>

<p>Elesh Norn stood before him, glowing as though she housed a star. Her attenuated limbs had an insectile delicacy, and her long face had an arthropod's beauty. Her smile was narrow and self-satisfied, even as she scraped a servile bow in his direction.</p>

<p>"Welcome, Father." Elesh Norn's voice was a throaty, pleasing contralto. "Welcome home."</p>

<p>Karn looked around for Ajani and Sheoldred. He had seen the Planar Bridge engulf the praetor, as well as his compleated friend, but he saw no sign of them here. It must have deposited them elsewhere. Only he and Elesh Norn stood upon this plateau, heaped with drifts of white porcelain sand. Below the plateau, insectoid Phyrexians seethed in a glistening, white-gold mass.</p>

<p>Norn grabbed his chin, wrenched his attention back toward her. "You have been away for far too long," she hissed. "We have missed you. You deserve to share in the glory of what is to come."</p>

<p>Karn tried to rise but found he couldn't move his legs. He tried to summon his spark, to transport himself somewhere, anywhere, but he was too broken, too tired. Norn's claws dug into the metal of his cheeks, turning his head. His neck complained at even that motion, the joints grinding together—and then he saw it. A small, stunted sapling growing from the porcelain sand. Its gnarled, delicate branches reminded him of the small trees he saw above the timber line in the mountains. Its pale limbs glistened with an iridescent sheen. Beads of oil hung from its twigs like buds.</p>

<p>Even now, in this hell, surrounded by monsters, he couldn't help but feel a tenderness for that tree. A living thing, fighting against all odds to survive. "What is it?"</p>

<p>Norn leered down at him, her rows upon rows of teeth spread into a mocking rictus. "It is the beginning of great things, Father. It is the beginning of <em>everything</em>."</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Episode 4: A Brutal Blow</title><link>https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/magic-story/episode-4-brutal-blow-2022-08-15</link><guid>https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/magic-story/episode-4-brutal-blow-2022-08-15</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>Being on the <em>Weatherlight</em>'s deck made Karn nostalgic. Even though a different crew scrambled along its rigging, laughed as they worked on the deck, and tinkered with its shining mechanisms, the scents and sounds felt comfortably eternal. Golden light scattered among the white clouds below and glistened on the beeswaxed decks. Blue skies stretched until the horizon. The sea breeze chilled his metal body. Only hours before, the four of them—Teferi, Jaya, Jodah, and Karn himself—had been pulled from the upper floor of Argive's watchtower one by one, dangling from a rope ladder like insects above the vast city below.</p>

<p>"Shanna is waiting," Jodah said. "We must set the <em>Weatherlight</em>'s course."</p>

<p>Karn nodded, and Jaya fell into step beside them, her white hair streaming out behind her like a pennant. They entered the stateroom. Shanna stood near an oval table, her arms crossed over her burnished leather breastplate. Arvad, his already white skin sickly with his vampire's pallor, hung back in the shadows behind her. Teferi lay on a nearby cot, his eyes closed. Raff had pulled up a three-legged stool beside him. He'd splayed his hands over Teferi's gut wound and his magic's silvery sheen wafted from his palms like heat waves. Slimefoot joined them, mushroom-like pups cavorting around its base. Tiana squeezed her wings in tight to her body to fit through the door.</p>

<p>Shanna put out a fruit bowl Karn had thought to be ornamental and sat down. "I might be the captain, Karn, but you're setting the course. Tell me where the <em>Weatherlight</em> flies."</p>

<p>"We must force the Phyrexians into open warfare," Karn said, "before they gain in strength and convert more populations. We will do this by baiting them with the three things the Phyrexians want more than anything else: the sylex, the Mana Rig, and<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> me."</p>

<p>Jodah looked to Karn, worry brightening his eyes. "It's a risky plan. Defeat would mean losing Dominaria's most precious artifacts—and you, Karn. I don't like the idea of you in such danger."</p>

<p>"I like some risk," Jaya said. "If we draw them out, if we win, we kill the Phyrexians at the root. They're like ivy: you have to pull it early. Once it's established, it'll spread."</p>

<p>"If the events at Argivia have taught us anything," Karn said, "it is that our forces are stronger together than apart. Phyrexian tactics rely on dividing us, on the secret work the sleeper agents can perform in the shadows. If we are separate, we are vulnerable. Together, less so."</p>

<p>"Still," Jodah said, "our allies are stretched across all Dominaria. With Argivia fallen, the most powerful armed force on this continent is no longer ours—it is theirs. We have to recruit all the allies we can to make our stand."</p>

<p>"So we split up," Jaya said. "We recruit allies and bring them to the Mana Rig."</p>

<p>The crew from the <em>Weatherlight </em>had been quiet during this discussion, but now Raff sighed. The magic faded from his fingers. He looked up at Karn. "My sister will fight for you."</p>

<p>"I'll seek out Danitha," Jaya decided.</p>

<p>"Yavimaya's been attacked as well," Jodah said. "The elves will help us. I can go to them, to recruit them to fight at our side."</p>

<p>"I will go to the Mana Rig directly," Karn said, "to speak to Jhoira. I am the only one who has read and can remember the key I found to the sylex. I need to record that information for others to examine."</p>

<p>Teferi roused from his stupor. "I'll go with you, Karn. I need time to recover, and I can also recruit our Shivan allies while the Mana Rig and the sylex occupy you."</p>

<p>"You do not have good luck," Karn said, regarding Teferi's wounds.</p>

<p>"I think I have excellent luck," Teferi said. "I survived, didn't I?"</p>

<p>"If we split up," Jaya said, her hair gusting around her face, "how will we tell if any of us have been compromised? Stenn didn't even know he was one of them."</p>

<p>"The scryer has difficulty focusing on Phyrexians," Karn said. "If I cannot view you, I will assume you have been compromised."</p>

<p>"It's a good thing you don't sleep," Jaya said.</p>

<p>Shanna looked to her crew, who had been listening patiently. "It's decided. Let's set sail."</p>

<hr />
<p>The Red Iron Mountains were so beautiful that planning a war here seemed irreverent. Not that Jaya was the devout type, but those harsh jagged peaks with shale cascading down the ravines, white in the light, and the alpine blooms drooping from the meadows in sprays of purple and gold, and that massive androgynous statue of some hero whose story had been lost to time<nbsp> . . .</nbsp></p>

<p>Well, maybe she was growing old, but Jaya could see herself relaxing outside a small cabin in a cedarwood tub in one of those shadowed valleys where war machines lay rotting, forgotten beneath emerald mosses and upright sword ferns, inert as boulders. Maybe with some chilled peppermint tea in hand. Now that would be a relaxing way to pass a decade or two.</p>

<p>She snorted at herself. <em>Not like you're ever going to retire! </em></p>

<p>"Jaya!" Ajani strode from the trees' deep shadows, his white fur glinting in the light and his cloak rippling behind him. "Danitha told me you arrived. I have been seeking deer to feed the camp. There is good hunting here."</p>

</figure>
</div>

<p>"Any luck?" Jaya asked.</p>

<p>Ajani offered her a fierce grin that revealed his teeth. "Always. The Llanowar millenaries remember the Phyrexian invasion well, and they've already sent scouts to join us. Some of the best archers in Dominaria."</p>

<p>When he'd leapt after Aron Capashen, Jaya had worried. "It looks like you didn't recover Aron?"</p>

<p>Ajani turned his gaze to Danitha's camp, established on the edge of a cloudy green glacier lake. Her Benalish knights had set up white canvas tents. In addition to House Capashen's proud tower with seven windows, House Tarmula's flag flew, a seven-pointed star upon it. A stewpot scented the air with smell of cooking onions.</p>

<p>"They outdistanced me, and by the time I circled around, you had left. So I started tracking them and encountered Danitha."</p>

<p>Danitha Capashen strode through the camp toward Jaya and Ajani. Her light-brown skin glowed with health and her hair, shaved along the sides, had been drawn back into a tight plume. Her armor gleamed silver with ribbons of gold crossed across her chest like Gerrard's sash, embedded with stained glass that gleamed in red, scarlet, and yellow petals.</p>

<p>"I tracked the Phyrexians to a base south of here, concealed in some caves," Ajani said.</p>

<p>"My father must be there." Danitha turned to Jaya. "Danitha Capashen, daughter of Aron Capashen, heir to the House Capashen. And you are?"</p>

<p>Well, well<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> it had been some time since Jaya hadn't been recognized.</p>

<p>"Jaya Ballard," Ajani cleared his throat, "fights alongside Jodah the Eternal."</p>

<p>Jaya snorted. Jodah collected nicknames like some little boys collected marbles. "I'm here to invite you to bring reinforcements to Shiv."</p>

<p>"Any friend to Ajani is welcome here," Danitha said. "But unfortunately, I can't commit my troops to fight at Shiv until I've rescued my father."</p>

<p>"The delay—"</p>

<p>"Is worth it, and if you would like to assist me, I would appreciate your help," Danitha said. "If my father is alive, you'll have House Capashen's gratitude and knights to call upon. And if he's not<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> well, you'll have House Capashen's new leader in your debt."</p>

<p>Jaya stretched her fingers, pulling flame from the air. The heat radiated across her skin. "Well, one sure way to get someone out of a cave is smoke."</p>

<hr />
<p>If there was any place on Dominaria where Jodah felt young, it was in the ruins of Kroog, in Yavimaya. The ancient domed building, its vaulting roof open to the sky, its golden stone draped with trailing pothos, seemed to hold the sunset's colors like a dragon-hoarded treasure. Exposed when a massive treefolk uprooted and migrated into the sea, it still smelled like earth.</p>

<p>"Jodah?"</p>

<p>He did not recognize the voice. A cerulean butterfly lit upon his shoulder. He moved to brush it away, then hesitated.</p>

<p>An elf stared at him, her light skin dappled with gold around her bright, intelligent eyes. Even though Jodah could not have said why, she seemed young. She wore a warrior's leather armor; scarlet, ochre, and orange, yet unlike the armor he'd seen on other Yavimayan elves, she'd integrated repurposed Thran technology.</p>

</div>

<p>"You're Jodah the Eternal?" she said. "The Archmage Jodah?"</p>

<p>Jodah coughed. For some reason, with the elf staring at him, he felt particularly self-conscious about the butterfly lazily beating its dinner plate-size wings near his face.</p>

<p>"Elder Druid Jenson Carthalion told me all about you. Some people say there were many different Jodahs who took your name as a title, but I always thought there was only one."</p>

<p>"I'm here to negotiate with Meria," Jodah said, "to recruit troops to fight for the New Coalition at Shiv."</p>

<p>"You must be four thousand years old!" She looked him up and down like she'd look at an archaeological artifact. The butterfly flitted away. Jodah cleared his throat. He felt sized up, a sensation he did not appreciate.</p>

<p>Then the elf sighed. "I wish I could help you, Jodah. Since I was a child, I've dreamed of fighting alongside you, of leading my people to your aid<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> of saving Dominaria together. But I'm sorry. I must think of my people."</p>

<p>Jodah smiled. So this was Meria. Only centuries of practice at diplomacy permitted him to conceal his shock. Seldom did elves follow someone with youth's freshness stamped upon their features—one reason he'd thought it best that he perform these negotiations himself. But then, seldom did elves seek shelter in old ruins, buildings of stone and metal. Dominaria was changing. "The Phyrexians are invading, Meria. It isn't a question of whether you fight. It's a question of when, of how—and the answers to both these questions, whether we will stand together, will determine if we achieve victory."</p>

<p>Meria dipped her head in solemn acknowledgement. "You are wise, Jodah the Eternal. I am honored to meet you. Truly, I am. But neither your words nor your name will sway me. I see no reason for my warriors to abandon their homes for your cause. Yes, if the Phyrexians shadowed our canopy, we would fight—on our home ground, with the advantage. But travel to Shiv? No, I think not."</p>

<p>"The Phyrexians can create sleeper agents," Jodah said. "They can infiltrate—"</p>

<p>"We know," Meria said. "But when Yavimaya allows my people to return, Multani will sort the good from the bad."</p>

<p>"Would you rather that the fight come here?" Jodah said. "Better to snuff the Phyrexian threat now than let Yavimaya burn."</p>

<p>Meria's eyes glinted. She wasn't angry. She wasn't scared. She wasn't even implacable. She was amused, and this befuddled Jodah most of all. He wasn't used to being laughed at by someone a fraction of his age.</p>

<p>"Very compelling arguments." Meria smiled and patted him on the shoulder. But Jodah could tell, as she turned away, that she'd made up her mind.</p>

<p>Jodah had failed. Meria would not lead her people to Shiv.</p>

<hr />
<p>Jaya hunched behind a stone outcropping that overlooked the entire valley. Not the most comfortable position, but she couldn't complain about the view. At the end of a narrowing ravine, the cave's large triangular mouth gaped. Two Phyrexians guarded the opening, centipede-like monstrosities with butchered human bodies in their cores. Their multiple limbs glinted in the sunlight, restive.</p>

<p>From her vantage, Jaya could see what the Phyrexian monstrosities could not.</p>

<p>Ajani led half a dozen Llanowar scouts to remove the guards from the perimeter, clearing out the creatures that lurked in the shadowy woodlands. He'd been successful—so far. No dying creature had shouted an alert.</p>

<p>Danitha led the bulk of her force. Her knights lay in wait near the cave's mouth, concealing themselves in gullies, behind bushes and trees, in the mossy nooks behind granite boulders. Danitha held up her hand, signaling: <em>Jaya, it's time.</em></p>

<p>Jaya distilled her focus until it was keen as a blade inside her. She narrowed her eyes at the cave. The air itself combusted, exploding into flame. The pine needle turf smoldered, sending thick clouds of smoke toward the sky.</p>

<p>The Phyrexian guards launched into action, swarming through the underbrush. Danitha pointed at three knights, who charged, cleaving the nearest monstrosity with their broadswords. It fell into bloody hunks, each of which grew dozens of tiny legs. Danitha raised her hand again, and she sent another splinter force to drive the Phyrexian pieces toward Jaya's position.</p>

<p>Once they were near enough, Jaya sent out plumes of fire after each segment. This time, when the knights stabbed the cooking Phyrexian chunks, they stayed dead.</p>

<p>"Good riddance," Jaya muttered.</p>

<p>At the cave's entrance, heavy smoke coiled into the air. More Phyrexians poured from the cave—well over two dozen humanoid abominations.</p>

<p>"Nine Hells," Jaya muttered. The knights had revealed themselves too early. Their inexperience showed: they fought as if their opponents were ordinary soldiers, rather than interplanar horrors.</p>

<p>A vortex of flame shielding her, Jaya stalked down the hillside. As she blasted Phyrexians, she glimpsed brief horrors behind her gouts of fire: a compleated woman, iron coils escaping from her heart, stripping a Benalish knight of his armor like a child removing the limbs from an insect; a compleated child, plunging her wires beneath another knight's armor, bursting him apart from the inside. Danitha fought back-to-back with her second-in-command, her face grim.</p>

<p>The Benalish were being overwhelmed.</p>

<p>Ajani led his Llanowar scouts into the fray, cleaving the Phyrexian monstrosities with his double-headed axe. The Phyrexian advance halted, stymied.</p>

<p>Jaya thought, for one hopeful moment, that the leonin had turned the battle in their favor, until a new Phyrexian emerged from the cave, more monstrosities at his heels. He was human-form, broad and muscular, with pale armor merging into his torso. Metal spikes curved through his pale blond hair like horns and his orange-irised eyes wept black oil across his ice-white cheeks. He held up his double set of arms, which merged at the biceps, in ironic welcome. "And here I was hoping some of my old crew might be in the rescue party. Shame—I was so looking forward to catching up."</p>

<p>Jaya, despite the fire in her hands, chilled down to her guts. <em>Ertai.</em> She'd heard of him, sure—one of the original crew of the <em>Weatherlight. </em>He'd been dead for centuries—and still had death's pallor, though some force reanimated his twitching features. His eyes possessed a terrible intelligence.</p>

<p>"It's such a pleasure to be back," he said. "And I have learned so, so much in my time away. Would you like to see?"</p>

<p>And Aron Capashen stepped from the cave's mouth.</p>

<hr />
<p>Karn brought out his sketch of the clay tablet he'd found in the Caves of Koilos, then lost in Oyster Bay. He traced the arcing symbols. Though he could remember what he had found perfectly, he could not make sense of it.</p>

<p>"Karn?" Teferi peeked into Jhoira's workshop, which Karn, in her absence, had co-opted. "I've spoken with Darigaaz, but the dragons are still deliberating."</p>

<p>"And the Ghitu?"</p>

<p>"The Ghitu will not commit until the dragons do. It's council politics."</p>

<p>"The viashino?"</p>

<p>"Same story." Teferi inclined his head. "Only the goblins have come forward."</p>

<p>"The goblins? That is a surprise," Karn admitted.</p>

<p>"They wanted to be first," Teferi said. "They're confident the dragons, the Ghitu, and the viashino will come to fight when the Phyrexians attack, but the goblins wanted to be able to say that <em>they </em>'joined first' so they'll be able to use that as leverage in future relations." Teferi lay down on Jhoira's cot. He closed his eyes in exhaustion. Although magic had healed him, he was still recovering.</p>

<p>A screech broke the workshop's quiet—so loud that Jhoira's thinner beakers shattered. Teferi bolted upright, now alert. A second later an impact rattled down, shaking dust onto the delicate apparatuses, ruining experiments. The sulfurous stench wafting through the door made Teferi cough, though Karn's senses told him its concentration wasn't high enough to harm human life.</p>

<p>"What—" Teferi began.</p>

<p>Karn pressed his finger to his mouth to request quiet. He was listening. The <em>Weatherlight</em>. Karn left the workshop. Though weary, Teferi followed.</p>

<p>In Shiv's skies—so hot they were not blue but a seared white—the <em>Weatherlight </em>wheeled through the sky, draped in the rotting detritus it had been using as camouflage from the Phyrexians hunting them. It seemed they hadn't been able to elude one, though, which circled them like a predator. Unfurled, the Phyrexian dominated the sky. Its thin bat-like wings had clawed metal tines with too many joints, and its body was a mass of fibers. The<em> Weatherlight </em>fought it, firing harpoons into the beast, but the barbs fell through the loose mesh of fibers, useless. Magic blinked across the sky, but even Karn could see that this creature effortlessly outmatched the <em>Weatherlight</em>.</p>

<p>But then a small shadow in Shiv's white sky grew closer, spreading two massive wings: a dragon. Even Karn had to appreciate a full-grown dragon: no mightier being existed on Dominaria, the apex of both violence and wisdom. The shadow brightened, glinting as the sun struck its scales. Darigaaz had come to their aid. He turned down, diving, and gained speed, until he struck the monstrosity.</p>

<p>The Phyrexian exploded at the impact, parted into a writhing mass. Still airborne, its fragmented body draped between its wings. The monstrosity attempted to draw itself together. Slick iron fibers wove and interlocked.</p>

<p>But Darigaaz had already pivoted midair. He exhaled a flame so white-hot over the Phyrexian monstrosity that it did not burn: it vaporized. Molten metal droplets rained onto the Mana Rig's deck, followed by Darigaaz himself. People scattered, retreating to a respectful distance.</p>

<p>"Planeswalker Teferi." Darigaaz bowed his head. "I accept your proposal to fight here at Shiv. I will defend our skies—no doubt, my brethren will join me. As will those from the other nations who have seats on the Shivan council."</p>

<p>Teferi strode toward the dragon. He bowed. "We accept the allegiance of the dragons of Shiv. Respectfully, of course."</p>

<p>Darigaaz bowed his head, solemn. He flung himself into the sky, his takeoff an economy of power, and spiraled upward into the blue.</p>

<p>In the silence, Jhoira slid down a rope from the <em>Weatherlight</em>'s deck onto the Mana Rig. Her owl swooped down and landed on her shoulder, its metal body gleaming in the sun. "That's a hard act to follow."</p>

<hr />
<p>Aron Capashen stepped out from the cave. The surgical lines on his face still had raw edges, but they did not weep blood: instead, black oil glistened near the sutures. The lines did look<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> artful, Jaya had to admit, as if Ertai had carefully considered each arcing cut over Aron's cheekbones, then deliberately contrasted it with the jagged line across his forehead. But otherwise, Aron seemed devastatingly human. His expression was anguished—unlike the other Phyrexians, he seemed self-aware. He was still Aron Capashen, and he knew what had been done to him, what it meant. His lips formed the words: <em>please, don't look at me. </em>But he did not, could not, voice them.</p>

<p>"Father." Danitha's gasp was hoarse—yet so pained. Jaya wished she could provide some iota of comfort.</p>

<p>"What have you done?" Ajani demanded.</p>

<p>"Sheoldred has taught me that beauty lies in change," Ertai said. "It's a hard lesson, when applied to oneself. But when applied to others, the beauty of change becomes more apparent, its aesthetics a revolution. Watch."</p>

<p>Aron's face opened along the surgical incision lines, unfurling to reveal that his skull had been replaced with steel, his eye with a crystal lens, and that his brain lay protected beneath glass. Unlike other Phyrexian monstrosities, Aron's changes had a clockwork intricacy, each delicate mechanism ticking and whirring. It reminded Jaya of a star map.</p>

<p>"My father is not your plaything." Danitha's voice sounded flat with shock, but her eyes burned with rage. Her hands on her broadsword, she stalked toward Ertai and Aron. Her father watched her with pained hope—for what, Jaya did not know.</p>

<p>No Phyrexians moved to intercept her.</p>

<p>Ertai watched with fascination. "Aron? Do your duty."</p>

<p>Aron lurched forward. He raised his hands, jerkily, and drew his sword. He lunged at Danitha. She parried, looking startled. His movements seemed bizarre, twitchy and unwieldy, like he was resisting himself. Or resisting Ertai's command? He swiped down again, and this time Danitha caught his blow on her broadsword. She forced him back, throwing him off. His intact eye wept glistening oil as he marched toward her again.</p>

<p>"Danitha," said Aron, his voice strange and distorted. "Do your duty." His words were a distorted echo of Ertai's.</p>

<p>Devastation crossed Danitha's face so quickly that Jaya, at this distance, almost missed it. But then Danitha's lips firmed. Her gaze turned both steely and pitying. "Yes, Father."</p>

<p>This time, when he brought his blade down on her, Danitha side-stepped. She raised her broadsword and swept it down in a graceful arc, separating his head from his shoulders.</p>

<p>Ertai watched all this with dispassion. "No respect for art. But I suppose I can always sew that back on."</p>

<p>He waved one three-fingered hand.</p>

<p>The mountains shook. Stone broke, and rubble tumbled down. Sharp shale spun past Jaya, cutting her cheek. She gasped and clutched at her injury. A Phyrexian monstrosity broke free from the mountain in front of them, shattering it into rubble. The roar of rock sliding from its body brought tears to Jaya's eyes. The monstrosity reared into the sky, so large that it blotted out the sun. Its plated body rose, brimming with complex mechanisms and weaponry, perched upon immense, deceptively thin legs. Its head was a battering ram, and its tail ended in a stinger, dripping with oily venom.</p>

<p>"Dim-Bulb's stupid horns<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> that's <em>huge</em>," Jaya whispered. A Phyrexian dreadnought. It had to be the largest one she'd ever seen. "How are we supposed to fight <em>that</em>?"</p>

<hr />
<p>Meria paused, her head cocked. Birds arrowed through the sky overhead, screaming. She watched them, a frown marring her forehead between her brows. Hoots boomed throughout the forest as monkeys shouted the alarm, and Jodah even heard the coughing roar of some great forest cat.</p>

<p>Meria turned to face him. "Something is coming."</p>

<p>She spun and ran out from the building. Jodah fell into pace beside her. In the distance, tree branches rocked—then shattered, exploding upward in a burst of greenery as a dragon engine reared into Yavimaya's vacant blue skies.</p>

<p>Jodah had never seen a mechanism so vast. Its bronze skull glistened in the hot tropical light, blotting out the sun. Its razor-edged back sloped away into the rainforest, longer than the ridge of a hill, and it waded through the trees—toward Jodah, Meria, and the elves.</p>

<p>The dragon engine's serrated mouth gaped open in a voiceless roar. Its thrum was so deep Jodah couldn't hear it: he could only feel it, like a blow to his heart. The vibrations traveled through the landscape, shattering branches. Parrots dropped from the trees, stunned. Small marsupials fell, eyes and noses bleeding. Jodah touched his face, pressing his index finger to the hot trickle that tickled his lips. He, too, bled. Yavimaya elves emerged from their buildings, scrambling to arm themselves. Riders led their kavu from the treetop stables. One male elf stumbled from his cottage holding an infant bleeding from its nose. He stared at Meria with beseeching eyes.</p>

<p>The dragon engine tore through the rainforest, uprooting a tree.</p>

<p>Meria gasped. "It's destroying Magnigoths. Those trees have stood for centuries!"</p>

<p>Jodah began to catalyze his spells. He could feel the power rising within him, so brilliant that it poured from his skin, that it lifted him from the ground, that it cradled him. To hold all this magic at the ready<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> It was as integral to his being as his veins. He prepared himself.</p>

<p>All around him, Yavimaya elves evacuated their homes, dragging children and bundled belongings away from the fight. Jodah caught teary but brief farewells as warriors told their offspring to be quiet and brave and then embraced their partners before parting ways.</p>

<p>Warriors astride kavu clung to every tree branch, their bows, spears, and blades held at the ready. Spellcasters stood in phalanxes upon the mossy turf, brighter than blossoms in their finery, their fingers interlocked, their lips already moving with chants to conceal the retreating civilians. Meria gave Jodah an anguished look and led him to the forefront of her warriors.</p>

<p>With one sweep, the dragon engine cleared the ground between itself and the Yavimayan village. Ancient trees crashed to the ground, splintering, the leaf-shaped houses upon their boughs crushed. Soil clouded the air, then settled, revealing a raw ditch between the Yavimaya and the dragon engine. The dragon engine had not only uprooted ancient trees so that their roots framed the battlefield, exposing dirt—it had also revealed artifacts from the Thran city deep beneath the Ruins of Kroog. Ground water seeped through the rich loam, pooling around the golden objects. Meria gasped.</p>

<p>"I recognize that," she breathed. "From my studies. Oh, that—Jodah, that is our hope."</p>

<p>Jodah couldn't determine which object Meria meant in the jumble, but that she had picked out one artifact from this distance was remarkable. Little wonder that the Yavimayans followed her.</p>

<p>The dragon engine craned its head as if to look at their armed forces. Within its skull, its driver sat like a jewel, illuminated with a pale blue light. Even from this distance Jodah could make out her features, see the red light of her replaced eye. She matched Karn's descriptions: Rona. Her teeth were barred in a fierce smile.</p>

<p>In an echo of Rona's own body language, the dragon engine opened, exposing its barbed jaws. Within its mechanized armor plates, the remains of small, rotting forest creatures hung suspended between oily ligaments. Rona had butchered them to restore the dragon engine's bulk.</p>

<p>Jodah's stomach turned.</p>

<p>"Archers!" Meria cried.</p>

<p>The Yavimayans loosed their arrows, but they were useless against the dragon engine's plates. Jodah could feel the machine building its energy—and at this proximity another roar would wipe them out.</p>

<hr />
<p>Ertai laughed softly. He lifted his arms. The upper set had only three stubby fingers on each hand, which he beckoned with. The dreadnought swung its tail around and crushed Phyrexians and Benalish knights alike as it spewed venom. The viscous fluid arced out, so acidic it melted trees and boiled the alpine creek. The blow echoed throughout the mountain range, triggering distant rockfalls and avalanches.</p>

<p>Despite the cacophony of tumbling rock, Jaya could still hear Ertai's delighted laughter. He waved his arms, and the Phyrexians launched themselves into the devastated Benalish forces. Ajani fought at Jaya's back, hacking away at the creatures that skittered toward her. Danitha retreated to aid her troops. She shouted orders that caused the Benalish knights to reform around the Llanowar archers, circling up now that they were surrounded.</p>

<p>"Fire," she called, and the Llanowar elves released their bowstrings. Their arrows rebounded off the dreadnought's legs, not even denting its armor.</p>

<p>The dreadnought stretched and straddled the battlefield. It arched its spine. If it released more acid, they'd surely be doomed<nbsp> . . .</nbsp></p>

<p>"Stop!" Ertai called. His Phyrexians scuttled back, retreating into the rocks like so many crabs. The larger ex-human creatures ran toward the dreadnought's legs and clung there. Some knights paused. "Call off your fighters, Danitha."</p>

<p>"Or<nbsp> . . .</nbsp>?" Danitha asked.</p>

<p>Ertai smiled. He pointed at the dreadnought with one upper hand and the melted slag from its acid spray with the other. He raised his eyebrows. The bristles along his head seemed to lift with pleasure.</p>

<p>"Or," he said.</p>

<p>Danitha lifted one hand. Her knights stopped fighting. Jaya let her flames die, overexertion washing through her. Ajani settled back, his double-handed axe weighed between his palms with more than some reluctance, teeth bared. He met Jaya's gaze, and she gave him an exhausted shrug. She didn't have a plan.</p>

<p>"Jaya. Ajani. If you don't give yourselves up to me," Ertai said, "I will tell the dreadnought to eradicate these people. All of them."</p>

<hr />
<p>Jodah lifted his hands, raising his energy to form a protective barrier. The shield rippled from its brightest point, a white sheen that colored the air itself. He couldn't mitigate the effects of the dragon's booming roar, but he could soften them—even if his spell, however powerful, would only hold up beneath one blast.</p>

<p>"There. I need to reach that." Meria pointed at an uncovered Thran artifact that lay in the dirt between her troops and the dragon engine. She touched Jodah on the arm and looked up at him hopefully. "Can you leave that shield there to protect my people while you come with me? Out on the battlefield, I mean."</p>

<p>Jodah nodded. What was the nature of this artifact, that Meria pinned her people's lives on it? "Yes, I can do that."</p>

<p>Meria raised her voice in a cry, which Jodah assumed meant "hold," because he saw the archers shift from offensive to defensive postures, eyes wary. She nodded in satisfaction, then returned her attention to Jodah. "Ready?"</p>

<p>Jodah stretched out his fingers and pressed them into the air. The spell shimmered in response, then stabilized. Meria smiled at him, her face sharpened with intelligence and eagerness. She tapped her spear on the ground, and an intricate Thran tracery illuminated its length. Metal spurs shot out from one end of the spear, and a translucent webbing unfurled between them. Her spear appeared to also function as a powered Thran glider.</p>

<p>Meria threw one arm around him. "Hold on tight!"</p>

<p>Jodah stiffened—but too late. The glider jerked them both from their feet. He found himself unceremoniously clinging to Meria as the glider drove them both through the air. They zipped through his magical barrier. It offered some resistance, flexing, but permitted them passage. Hot magic buzzed along their skin, shocking in its power. The glider took a sharp turn, then dived toward the earth. They splashed down into a crater quickly filling with brackish water—right at the dragon engine's feet.</p>

<p>"Cover me," Meria said.</p>

<p>"Is that why I'm here?" Jodah said, dryly. But he readied his spells. He could still feel the shield they'd left behind to protect the Yavimayan warriors draining him. This did not stop him from summoning his reserves. "I'll do my best."</p>

<p>"Good." Meria, heedless of the filth, dropped to her knees and started searching the muddy waters. "It's here somewhere. I know I saw it<nbsp> . . .</nbsp>"</p>

<p>The dragon engine roared. Jodah flung up a radiant white bubble, protecting them. The sonic force beat against both of Jodah's shields. He summoned more arcane force to meet and negate the concussive energy; the dragon engine's roar heightened, then died. Jodah's shields faded with it, and exhausted, he fell to his knees. His entire body felt pummeled, like he'd stretched himself physically behind those shields to hold them. He didn't have it in him to do it again.</p>

<p>The dragon engine craned its head toward them. Jodah had the nasty suspicion Rona intended to target both him and Meria more directly with her next blow. "Hurry!"</p>

<p>"Aha!" Meria fished a silver globe covered in delicate golden Thran traceries from the muck. "Found it! I knew I'd seen one of these."</p>

<p>Meria's eyesight had to be exquisite for her to pinpoint <em>and </em>recognize a Thran artifact amongst the roots, dirt, and debris after the dragon engine's attack. "What is it?"</p>

<p>Meria twisted the globe, realigning the symbols into new configurations. It lit up. Brightness raced along the globe's equator at a quicker and quicker pace. Jodah could recognize a countdown anywhere. Meria cocked her head. "How fast do you think you can get us out of here?"</p>

<p>Jodah grit his teeth and readied a portal. The effort winded him even though he'd set the portal to transport them only a short distance. But he had already expended much of his strength in this battle. It felt like he peeled open that doorway-in-the-air with his fingernails.</p>

<p>Meria dove through, and Jodah leaped after her. He spun, held out his hand, and clenched it into a fist. The portal collapsed—just in time. The Thran artifact flashed, a bright red light that saturated the landscape as if in warning, and then instead of a boom there was—</p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p>Between the Yavimayan elves and the dragon engine, a thin film seemed to have formed. But it wasn't a film, not really. On the one side—the side on which Jodah stood—the air was thick with cloudy pollen, dust the dragon engine had kicked up, and humidity. He'd never realized that air had a color: not until he'd looked from an area <em>with</em> air to an area <em>without</em> it.</p>

<p>The Thran weapon had created a spherical vacuum. The dragon engine stood in the center of it, and it roared—and roared—in absolute silence.</p>

<p>But even from here Jodah could see how the dragon engine failed: the organic pieces inside it died. The mangled remains of the woodland creatures, confronted with vacuum, froze. Inside the dragon engine, tendons snapped, organs turned to slimy ice or burst, and muscle fibers solidified. The dragon's wires, writhing beneath its armor, seemed to have become more brittle. More than a few snapped off. The lights faded from the dragon engine, dimming inside its skull.</p>

<p>"I don't think the artifact is a weapon, really." Meria perched one hand on her hip. "I think the Thran used it to conduct scientific experiments in a vacuum. That's what I would do."</p>

<p>No, Jodah thought. This was a weapon. Perhaps even a Damping Sphere, though he'd never seen one do that before.</p>

<p>The dragon engine staggered toward the field's edge, then collapsed through the barrier. It fell so that half its body was in woodland and the other half remained in the vacuum. Rona, a distant mark in the dragon engine's head, opened a hatch and staggered out from her cavity. She half-slid, half-climbed from the dragon engine's head down its sloping body. The speed with which she made her descent awed Jodah—but then he supposed he'd be desperate, too. She paused at the edge of the woodlands, hands on her knees while she, apparently, breathed.</p>

<p>Meria made a small gesture with one hand. Spear-bearing kavu riders peeled away, shooting around the periphery toward Rona. She shot one glance behind her, then fled. Meria watched the chase, solemn. Her gaze shifted to the fallen Magnigoths. "Hundreds of years of life—lost in an instant."</p>

<p>Jodah inclined his head. "That's war."</p>

<p>"They will find us, won't they?" Meria said. "Wherever my people go."</p>

<p>Jodah nodded. Meria's eyes shone with both anger and grief.</p>

<p>"Then there's only one path for us. And it doesn't lie in Yavimaya."</p>

<hr />
<p>"Why am I worried that you won't let them go, even if I do hand myself over?" Jaya said to Ertai. She straightened her shoulders. She didn't intend to give herself up, but she didn't have another plan, either. Maybe, if she got close enough, she could summon a molten lance to spear him through the heart or superheat the air around Ertai's head<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> something, anything that could get them out of this—</p>

<p>A sweet breeze cleared the battlefield's stink. It brought with it the clean scent of leather and oil. The horizon began to brighten—the <em>western</em> horizon—with the sheen of gold. The air gained a peculiar, unearthly quality to it, as if its particles hummed with ancient tension.</p>

<p>An immense but sleek golden ship tore through the mountains' rubble, rocks kicking up in the wake behind it. The shimmering vessel swooped in a circle around the Phyrexian dreadnought. Hundreds of Keldon warriors leapt from the ship, landing on the dreadnought's wide scaley back, and they drove their blades and cleated boots into the creature's hide to secure themselves.</p>

<p>The <em>Golden Argosy</em>! Jaya had thought it had been lost to legend. Radha had mentioned that she'd found an artifact during the negotiations in Oyster Bay, but Jaya had never guessed Radha had rediscovered that ancient ship.</p>

<p>Radha herself led her warriors onto the Phyrexian dreadnought's battering-ram head. The Phyrexian monstrosities still on the ground seemed to realize that the dreadnought was vulnerable to this assault. Rather than sheltering against the dreadnought's legs, they too started to scale it to attack the Keldons.</p>

<p>"Archers, cover us. Knights, after me." Danitha charged the dreadnought. "For Dominaria!"</p>

<p>The knights roared and followed, plowing into the Phyrexians that sought to defend the dreadnought. The dreadnought, beneath the Keldon onslaught, released a moan that shook the entire landscape.</p>

<p>Ajani bellowed, "Archers, to me! Fire on the Phyrexians climbing the dreadnought!"</p>

<p>Jaya raised her hands. Her flame brightened with her renewed spirits, and she blasted the skittering creatures that had pivoted to attack the archers. Ajani pressed close to her, defending her from any Phyrexian that headed her way.</p>

<p>Radha had pierced the dreadnought's eye, leaving a gash large enough for Radha to stand within the socket. Aqueous humor spurted, followed by the thicker clear goop of vitreous gel. Radha hacked through the muscular iris. The dreadnought shrieked in agony, tossing its head to throw her off. Its lower jaw gaped. It dripped blood, black fluid, and pinkish organic matter from its mouth.</p>

<p>Ertai bellowed, "Sheoldred will hear of this!"</p>

<p>"I hope she does!" Jaya called.</p>

<p>The creature crumpled, one joint at a time relaxing into death. The Keldons on its back let out a cheer and then flattened themselves, bracing to ride out its fall. The Benalish knights who'd been fighting underneath the dreadnought scattered. Jaya and Ajani both stared up at the nearing bulk of the dreadnought's underbelly, how it blotted the sky. Jaya scrambled out from underneath the dreadnought, squeaking past its final crash into the earth. The sound resounded in the mountains. Then, after that, the roar of avalanches and tumbling stone, until that, too, trickled into silence.</p>

<hr />
<p>Karn looked up as Jhoira entered her workshop.</p>

<p>"Hiding out here isn't the cleverest way to avoid me," Jhoira said.</p>

<p>Karn faced her. "I'm not hiding."</p>

<p>"You never answered my letters." Jhoira didn't sound hurt—more rueful.</p>

<p>"You wished to speak about Venser," Karn said. "I did not."</p>

<p>"But you do now?"</p>

<p>Karn dipped his head. "It was self-centered of me to be so consumed by the personal ramifications of Venser's sacrifice. He was also your friend."</p>

<p>Jhoira tilted her head. "Yes, I'm sorry, too. I was grieving. You were withdrawing because you were, too. Nothing selfish about that."</p>

<p>"Just different reactions to the same stimulus," Karn mused.</p>

<p>"Ah, I missed you." Jhoira laughed and embraced him. Her mechanical owl, disturbed, flitted away from her shoulder and landed in the workshop's beams overhead.</p>

<p>Karn doubted she obtained the comfort she sought: his body had a similar heat to a human's, but he could not offer her the same softness of flesh. He enjoyed her proximity anyway. His friends were so small and so mysterious. He could divine the inner workings of quartz, but still he would never perfectly understand Jhoira.</p>

<p>Jhoira patted Karn's arm and then released him. She dug some glittering metal parts from her pocket, Thran by the look of the golden tracery on them. "These will help me install a self-destruct mechanism on the Mana Rig. It's too powerful to ever allow in Phyrexian hands<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> Karn, it has been too long. We should not have let life come between us."</p>

<p>"Or unlife," Karn said.</p>

<p>Jhoira laughed. "I always forget that you have a sense of humor."</p>

<p>His communicator to the <em>Weatherlight</em> chimed on his neck. Karn, though startled that anyone would use it when not communicating with the <em>Weatherlight,</em> grasped it to activate it. "I am listening."</p>

<p>Jodah's voice came through, clear as if he stood in the room alongside them. "I am headed toward Shiv with the Yavimayan elves. Meria was able to recruit several neighboring groups. Since we're traveling by treefolk, it will take some time to reach you. Karn, there's something you need to know."</p>

<p>"Yes?" Karn asked.</p>

<p>Jodah hesitated. "There is a spy in the New Coalition."</p>

<p>Karn wished to be alone. He wished to be working on research—if only he could lose himself in a mathematical formula's crispness, if only he could forget how it felt to have oil and blood drying on his body. But he could not escape. He was locked into New Argive's watchtower, in a small circular upper room ringed in steel-shuttered windows. The dim yellow glow of the powerstone overhead illuminated a pedestal with a control panel beneath it. Only he had the key that would end the tower's lockdown, and he would not use it, not until they'd captured the Phyrexian, and not until he knew for certain his companions—Jodah and Jaya, Teferi and Stenn—were free from New Phyrexia's influence.</p>

<p>"Where's the sylex?" Jaya asked.</p>

<p>"Safe," Karn replied.</p>

<p>He turned away so that the others could not see his face. He needed a cloth but could not generate one. He held out his hands and drew particles from the aether, creating a small wire brush, identical to the one he'd used so many years ago, to clean himself after Urza sent him to war. His palms fizzed with magic as metal accrued.</p>

<p>"Why not tell us where it is now?" Jaya asked.</p>

<p>Teferi craned his head as if still searching the ceiling for the Phyrexian spy-creature. "Even Planeswalkers can be corrupted now. Karn's the only one with immunity to the oil."</p>

<p>While Karn appreciated that Teferi defended him, he did not like being spoken of as if he weren't in the room, as if he were an object. But he supposed old habits died hard. Teferi had been Urza's student before Karn's birth.</p>

<p>"I'm not a spy." Jaya seemed insulted.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't know if you were," Stenn said.</p>

<p>"I have a plan to find and defeat Sheoldred," Karn said. "I will tell you what it is once we have secured the tower."</p>

<p>Jodah rubbed his temples, looking irritable and drawn. Karn suspected portaling them all had strained the mage's capacity. Jodah said, "I'll trust you. I should have done so sooner, anyway."</p>

<p>"I can't say I like the idea of jumping through hoops to prove myself to you, Karn," Jaya said. "I can understand why you think we have to do it. But I don't like it. My circus days are over, and I was never all that interested in performing tricks."</p>

<p>"We need to find the Phyrexian creature first," Jodah said.</p>

<p>"Splitting up will be the most efficient way to search for the creature," Karn said.</p>

<p>"Jaya and I can take the upper floors," Jodah said. "Teferi and Karn can take the lower."</p>

<p>"That leaves me alone for the basement level." Stenn grimaced. "I suppose that's just as well. It's mostly one big boiler room. I'm liking this plan less and less."</p>

<hr />
<p>Karn led Teferi down the narrow metal stairs. The grating creaked underfoot, designed to accommodate a light human frame, not a ton of metal.</p>

<p>The hall on the third floor was narrow, the stone gray.</p>

<p>A click, and mechanical lamps flickered into dim life. "The toggle that controls the lights is next to the door," said Teferi, pleased.</p>

<p>"It may have passed this direction." Karn touched his fingers to a blood-and-slime trail on the wall at his shoulder height. "Let us follow it."</p>

<p>The trail terminated at a door labeled "STORAGE: WATERWORKS." Blobs of slime coated the hinge as if the creature had squeezed through the gap. Teferi crouched. He did not touch it, but his hand hovered over the goop. He looked up at Karn. "Should we call the others?"</p>

<p>"Not yet." Karn paused. "We don't know if the creature is still here."</p>

<p>Teferi opened the door a crack, then paused.</p>

<p>When nothing jumped through the gap, Teferi swung it open and stepped through. Karn followed. Tall racks of unused copper pipes loomed to one side. The other side had steel shelving that held wooden crates brimming with gears, flanges, and valves. Karn could see no further sign of the creature's passage.</p>

<p>Nonetheless: "Teferi, let us search the room."</p>

<p>The tight passages between the storage racks were designed to admit humans. Karn felt large and unwieldy. His elbows clanged against pipes, and he jostled boxes when he pressed through the narrow aisles. He paused, then knelt, ducking awkwardly under a low-hanging steam pipe. Blood dripped from the underside of a shelf.</p>

<p>He traced the fluid upward, to its source. It looked as though several pipes were<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> bleeding? A throbbing chunk of meat had attached itself, barnacle-like, to the copper. It released a gout of acid, dissolving the metal, and then it regurgitated a metallic barb from its side. Karn reached out to the fleshy deposit and crushed it.</p>

<p>"Karn, I need you to come over here."</p>

<p>Karn traced Teferi's voice and found Teferi standing in the corner near a wooden rack with tubs of sealant stacked upon it. Teferi pressed his fingers to his lips and tilted his head in a "listening" gesture.</p>

<p>"I don't like this." Jodah's voice carried through the pipes, clear.</p>

<p>"Don't like what?" said Jaya.</p>

<p>Karn frowned at Teferi. Teferi pointed at a vent.</p>

<p>"That Karn is having us search before telling us his plan." Jodah sounded bothered. "Shouldn't we talk this through together, work out the details as a team?"</p>

<p>Karn traced the vent with his gaze. The pipes disappeared into the ceiling.</p>

<p>Despite Jaya's earlier objection to jumping through hoops, Karn heard her low laugh. "Oh, so you're assuming <em>your</em> way is the only way to do this? Remind you of anyone?"</p>

<p>"Jaya, it's not like—"</p>

<p>"Go on." Jaya's laugh rang. "Protest some more. That'll really make your case."</p>

<p>The voices faded.</p>

<p>Karn contemplated the overhead vent. "It seems possible that the Phyrexian spy can use these vents to travel between floors."</p>

<p>Teferi pointed, without touching, at black oil on the vent's corner, then down to a vent on the floor. Karn crouched to view it. It looked as though the metal had been cannibalized, or possibly transformed, into an eyeball, ringed with small vicious teeth rather than lashes. Small additional eyes nestled beside it, opening and closing. Overhead, a skittering noise, then the click of metal claws ringing along the vents.</p>

<p>Teferi craned. "What do you think we should do?"</p>

<p>Karn pivoted, seeking the noise's source. It stopped. He'd lost it. "Unlike the others, you don't seem to take issue with my unilateral creation of a plan."</p>

<p>"Urza used you like a tool," Teferi said. "I never questioned it. I should have, and recently<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> Niambi got me thinking. I wish I'd been more thoughtful when I was younger. More observant. And that I'd treated you better."</p>

<p>Karn traced a <em>ting-ting-ting</em> along the pipes. He pursued it into the storeroom's corner and then located a small vent in the floor. Slime and blood slid down between the metal slots, thick and clotting. "We must proceed back to the stairs, then down to the second floor."</p>

<p>Karn led Teferi back into the stairwell. The metal creaked under his weight but did not bend. The bolts fixing it to the stone held.</p>

<p>Teferi's words had fallen short of an apology but had been heartfelt. Karn understood that what he was about to do was manipulative given their current conversation. But he felt he had little choice. "Thank you, Teferi. I need your help. Even I cannot watch the sylex continuously using the scryer. I have hidden it in a sea cave by Tolaria West."</p>

<p>Teferi nodded, solemn. "I honor your trust in me. I can help you guard it."</p>

<p>A shout reverberated down the stairwell: Jodah.</p>

<p>Karn reversed course. He sprinted up the stairs, the grate rattling under his footsteps. Teferi ran after him, a touch slower due to his human limitations.</p>

<p>Karn located Jodah and Jaya on the fourth floor in a small office located off the main corridor. Jodah flung the squid-like Phyrexian off him, and it splatted into a wall. Jaya pressed her hands together and blasted it with white-hot flame—and the creature split into halves, avoiding the fire. Each half sprouted multiple multijointed legs from its gory insides. Hungry mouths bloomed along its carapace, ringed in tiny razor-sharp teeth.</p>

<p>Jaya parted her hands, dividing her flame, to pursue each half. The creature split again, this time into four small chittering beasts with dozens of legs growing from central gobs of flesh twined around with cables. The creatures scattered, each going in a differing direction.</p>

</div>

<p>Karn stomped on one that attempted to squeak past him out the door.</p>

<p>Jaya brought her hands together, trapping one between sizzling gouts of flame. "I wouldn't eat them," she said, "but they sure do fry up nice."</p>

<p>The creature cried out as it died, a high-pitched noise that subsided into a bubbling whine. Jodah gathered more white energy between his hands, but the other creatures had skittered away.</p>

<p>Teferi arrived, panting, at the door, hands held at the ready—just in time to see the creatures squeeze themselves through the cracks in the stone, leaving behind nothing but glistening oil and mucus as a sign of their escape.</p>

<p>The four of them stared at the destroyed office: the smoldering papers, the shattered chair. Stenn arrived, dripping with sweat. He tried to peer around Teferi, then stepped back, bending over. He wiped his forehead against his sleeve.</p>

<p>"Too many stairs," he huffed.</p>

<p>"If they split like that," Teferi said, "then we can't know how many are in the building."</p>

<p>Karn lifted his foot to examine the pulp beneath it. "Interesting."</p>

<p>"While some people might find fighting an unknown number of opponents that can seep through walls and attack at any time <em>interesting</em>," Jaya said, "I can think of a good hundred other ways I'd like to spend the evening."</p>

<p>"Karn," Jodah said, "please<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> just tell us your plan—and the sylex's location."</p>

<p>Teferi, carefully, didn't look at Karn. "After all these years, Karn," Jodah said, "can you trust none of us?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Wise," Stenn said. "If Sheoldred knew the sylex's location, she would stop at nothing to attain it. Since any of us could be a sleeper agent, we can't risk having that become common knowledge—and we don't know how well that<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> that <em>thing</em> can listen."</p>

<p>"You must be the most stubborn, inflexible—" Jodah said.</p>

<p>"Just like some people I know." Jaya sighed. "The least we can do is develop a way to locate the creature. It's doing us no good searching for it blindly."</p>

<p>"We have biological samples," Karn said.</p>

<p>Jodah knelt to examine the goop and sighed. "If I developed a<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> tracker, of sorts, using that material, it could follow organisms with similar tissue. But it wouldn't be some<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> Phyrexian detector. It would only be able to locate that one creature and whatever it's split into."</p>

<p>"Sounds better than nothing," Jaya said.</p>

<p>Jodah looked up at Karn. "Could you generate impenetrable metal shells around the material? I don't want to risk handling it, but we'll need to have the organic matter with us to guide and power the spell."</p>

<p>"Yes," Karn said. "Do you have further guidance regarding the object's construction?"</p>

<p>Jodah considered, then added, "Put a needle on it. I'll enchant that directly to guide us."</p>

<p>"Similar to a compass," Karn said.</p>

<p>Jodah nodded.</p>

<p>Karn created the metal items to Jodah's specification. He created each one to be the size of a clamshell, small enough to fit human hands, and built it up around a gob of Phyrexian flesh. He handed them to Jodah.</p>

<p>While Jodah grasped them and muttered, weaving his radiant spells, Karn stepped off to the side. In a small nook between crates, he kept his back to the others and generated a miniature scrying device, similar to the one he had made in Oyster Bay but smaller. When he was done, he intended to hang it on the chain around his neck alongside the <em>Weatherlight</em> beacon. He missed Ajani and wished the leonin was here to help him.</p>

<p>A haze filled the amulet's crystalline surface. Karn frowned. Ajani—where was he? The scryer stuttered, then resolved. Ajani seemed to be fighting. Karn could not make out the shadowed forms that Ajani exchanged blows with, but he suspected them to be Phyrexian, which explained the scryer's difficulty focusing on them. The image clarified, and Karn saw Ajani speaking with a young Capashen knight, a woman with a brash set to her shoulders.</p>

<p>He sought the sea caves by Tolaria West. No Phyrexians searched the coast; the area seemed serene. If Teferi was a spy, he had not yet reported to Sheoldred. Karn frowned.</p>

<p>"Karn, I—" Jaya stopped. Frustration clouded her face. "What's that?"</p>

<p>Stenn peered around her. "Yes, what <em>is</em> that?"</p>

<p>Karn hung it from the necklace. "It is not of concern."</p>

<p>"Jodah finished your amulet." Jaya handed it to him. "He's almost done."</p>

<p>Karn inspected it. Its locator needle swung, bobbing between two points as if confused.</p>

<p>Jodah pocketed his. "I'm going to return to checking the upper floors."</p>

<p>Jaya moved to go after him, but Karn lifted a hand to stop her. "Your long-standing friendship aside, I do not think your quick tongue has a calming effect."</p>

<p>"True," Jaya conceded. "Stenn, given this creature can ooze through walls, are there maintenance areas we should be checking for infestation? Crawl spaces?"</p>

<p>"Yes, actually," Stenn said. "There's an elaborate venting system to allow air to escape from the lower levels, should the city need to retreat into the earth for defensive reasons."</p>

<p>Teferi whistled, clearly impressed. "I'll go with Jodah."</p>

<p>"Then I shall take the basement alone," Karn said.</p>

<p>"Better you than me," Stenn said, fervent. "That room is disconcerting. There's so much noise from the boilers that you'd never be able to hear something sneaking up on you."</p>

<p>Karn waited until Stenn, Jaya, and Teferi had left the room. He headed down into basement level, the locator in his palm.</p>

<p>If Jodah were compromised, would the enchantment even work?</p>

<p>The basement level consisted of a short but broad corridor edged with pipes. Unlike the pipes in storage above, these were live: hissing with steam, their shutoffs cranked open, their valves leaking. The rooms held boilers and hydraulics constructed with intricate beauty from copper and steel, each rivet lovingly set and integrated with Thran technology.</p>

<p>"Ah, Karn!" Jodah entered the boiler room, shouting to be heard over the din. Teferi followed him. "I've been looking for you. I think I need to recalibrate the locators so that the needle only points toward the nearest creature. It's also having a hard time differentiating up from down. If you could—"</p>

<p>Jaya and Stenn opened the door.</p>

<p>"Just who I was looking for," Jaya said. "This thing you made isn't working, Jodah. It's useless. Keeps on pointing, then moving, like it can't make up its mind."</p>

<p>But Jodah stared at her. "Are you bleeding?"</p>

<p>Jaya clutched her arm. Her eyes narrowed. "Never seen a flesh wound before?"</p>

<p>"Why didn't you tell us?" Jodah asked. He glanced over at Karn, meaningfully.</p>

<p>Karn handed Jodah his locator.</p>

<p>"Why would I? I'm not five years old." Jaya sounded insulted. "It's just a scrape."</p>

<p>"That's not what I meant." Jodah stretched his fingers over the locator, pulling up a meshed spell network from the device and tweaking it. He flicked his fingers down, and the spell settled back into the metal. Jodah returned the locator to Karn. "What if glistening oil has gotten inside you?"</p>

<p>"It didn't," Jaya said, icy.</p>

<p>"If that's true," Jodah said, "then why hide it?"</p>

<p>"I wasn't hiding it," Jaya said. "It just wasn't important."</p>

<p>In the floors above, a rattling—then a boom. It sounded like something had overturned one of the racks filled with pipes. Karn calculated that several dozen pipes must be rolling on the floor to create such a din. "It must be upstairs. Teferi, Stenn, you investigate with Jaya."</p>

<p>Teferi nodded, his face solemn and his eyes on Jaya. Perhaps he thought Karn intended for him to watch Jaya, due to her wound. Karn did not think glistening oil could infect so quickly, and yet<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> how could he be sure?</p>

<p>Jodah handed a locator to Karn. "Could you change the needle so it rests on a bearing? Or at least something that can pivot? I think it should be able to point up and down as well as in a circular motion."</p>

<p>Karn nodded and set to work at altering the mechanisms. Jodah leaned over the locators. He drew his hands over them, pulling up the spells so they hovered midair in delicate glowing magical networks. He tinkered, altering how the nodes and colors connected.</p>

<p>Normally Karn enjoyed working at someone's shoulder on a mechanical task. It was peaceful. But not so with Jodah.</p>

<p>Jodah leaned back on his heels and pushed his unkempt hair back from his face. He wore a rueful expression, its ageless quality at odds with his apparent youth. "You've seemed<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> different since your return from New Phyrexia."</p>

<p>When Karn had returned to find that Jodah and Jhoira had been involved while he was away, he'd been<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> startled. And uncomfortable. Even though Jodah and Jhoira's relationship had not continued, its aftereffects had. Karn considered responding more tactfully. But who knew what a moment of honesty might reveal here? "Recently, the way you offer advice has reminded me of Urza."</p>

<p>"Ah, and I, the ancient, wise, and powerful wizard<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> may have grown arrogant over the eras." Jodah pressed his hands into the spells, pushing the magic back into the metal. "Jhoira sees you as vulnerable. It made me feel like I had to look out for you, for her sake."</p>

<p>The needles in the locators quivered. Each swung wildly, spinning in differing directions.</p>

<p>"I would prefer to be your partner in this venture," Karn said.</p>

<p>"Partners confide in each other," Jodah said.</p>

<p>Karn pretended to hesitate. He nodded, slowly. "If you were compromised, I don't believe that you would be so obvious in your anger and impatience. The sylex is located in a warehouse in Estark."</p>

<p>Jodah laughed at that. "Well. Thanks for that, I suppose."</p>

<p>The needles pointed in different directions. All directions.</p>

<p>Jodah stared at the locators, dismayed. "How could I get this wrong twice?"</p>

<p>"You did not," Karn said.</p>

<p>The walls rustled with sudden movement.</p>

<p>Creatures flung themselves at Karn and Jodah, cables outstretched and mouths seeking. Jodah attempted to ready his magic, but the light around his hands was dim, flickering. He had exhausted himself from portaling them to the tower, then again from creating the locators.</p>

<p>A half-dozen more creatures launched themselves at Jodah, wet and fluttering. Karn adjusted his stance to defend Jodah. He seized a creature from the air and ripped it in half. He flung it outward at the other creatures. He swiped another from the air. But there were too many—some got through.</p>

<p>Jodah seared one with a blast of pale light, then fell to his knees in exhaustion. Creatures had started to climb up his body, their probing mouths searching for his skin. Even though Karn's instincts cried out for him to watch the walls, he turned to Jodah. He peeled off the creatures, ripping clinging tentacles in the process, and flung them aside. The disconnected tentacles bound to Jodah in clots. The clusters began to grow sucking mouths.</p>

<p>Flame roared throughout the room. The roar deafened Karn. Heat rushed through the room, sterilizing it, and poured over his body in sheets. It felt pleasant, warm and ticklish. The flames poured forward and licked at Jodah, gently. The creatures lodged on his body bubbled.</p>

<p>Karn reached forward, and this time was able to remove the remaining clinging creatures one at a time. The limbs drooped free. He pulled the rest from Jodah's prone body, then turned to face their rescuer: Jaya. Her fire centered around her, white-hot, and illuminated her face. Its light cast the lines worn into her skin into relief, and the heat rippling the air caused her white hair to lash around her. Her eyes reflected the firelight. She smiled, her lips tight.</p>

<p>Stenn ran into the room. Jaya's blast wrapped around him, not touching him, but repelling his Phyrexian attackers. He stabbed a small creature crab-skittering around the floor, pinning it. It writhed, legs outstretched and twitching, and he used a dagger to bisect it.</p>

<p>"He okay?" Jaya nodded at Jodah.</p>

<p>"Yes," Karn said. "The good news is that your locators appear to be working correctly."</p>

<p>Karn peered over at the locators. They pointed upward, but their needles did not quiver with tension as they had in the moments before the attack. He picked up his locator, then turned to the walls to see how the Phyrexian creatures had crept up on them. He could find no hints as to how so many had approached undetected. Inside the walls, Thran technology glistened gold. It probably connected to the powerstone and powered the hydraulics.</p>

<p>"What a relief." Jodah's laugh turned into a cough.</p>

<p>"Where's Teferi?" Stenn asked. "You'd think he would have heard the commotion."</p>

<p>The silence descended into discomfort. What if this mass attack had been but a distraction so that Teferi could try to transmit the sylex's location to the Phyrexians? What if the Phyrexians even now searched Tolaria West, laying waste to its coast? Karn wished to look in his scryer but dared not give his advantage away.</p>

<p>"I'll go look for him," Jaya said.</p>

<p>Karn moved to join her, placing himself at her side. Perhaps he would have an opportunity to examine his scryer. "And I as well."</p>

<p>Stenn crouched near Jodah. "I'll stay here. He's<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> not looking so great."</p>

<p>Jodah waved Stenn away, weakly. "I need a minute to recoup my strength. Go on. If Teferi is alone, and he suffers an attack like the one we just suffered, the results could be dire. He could be compleated. Or killed."</p>

<p>"And you're too weak to fight off a second attack alone," Stenn said, reasonably.</p>

<p>"You're too proud, old man," Jaya said. "Learn how to accept help."</p>

<p>From how Jodah's face pinched, Karn guessed this was an old argument between him and Jaya, one that he had not been privy to. Jaya waved Karn along with her, and the two left the basement, returning to the rattling staircase. They climbed upward in silence. Karn's footsteps, despite his care, seemed loud, metal against metal. Jaya ascended spritely as a cat.</p>

<p>"Your magic is extremely effective against the Phyrexian creatures," Karn said.</p>

<p>Though Karn could not see Jaya's face, he could hear the grin in her voice. "Have to say, controlled pyromania is the best part of being a fire mage. You do get a feeling for what burns."</p>

<p>"Your fire seems to sterilize them," Karn said. "As if it is inimical."</p>

<p>Jaya held up her hand, gesturing for silence. Karn fell still. Jaya's shoulders tensed. He could hear nothing. Jaya shook her head and continued upward.</p>

<p>"I cannot believe that anyone with such magic would be a Phyrexian spy," Karn said, though he could, indeed, believe it. A Phyrexian would be capable of any subterfuge. "You have killed more of those creatures than the rest of us combined. If something happens to me, someone must know where the sylex is, so it can be deployed."</p>

<p>"You finally decided you could trust me?" Jaya laughed. "I'm flattered."</p>

<p>"Yes," Karn said. "It is hidden in Suq'Ata."</p>

<p>Jaya didn't pause. "About time you told me that. Keeping the sylex's location in one mind is dangerous. Venser's spark or not, no one is invulnerable. Not even you."</p>

<p>She had a point.</p>

<p>In the upper stories, Teferi shouted, and both of them took off at a sprint. They found Teferi pinned to floor by a Phyrexian monstrosity that loomed over him like a hungry spider. Blood soaked his robes from a slash in his gut.</p>

<p>Karn tore the creature from Teferi's body—even though its claws, hooked into his flesh, took muscle with it. He slammed it against the wall, pulverizing it.</p>

<p>Jaya ran into the room. "Get down!"</p>

<p>Karn pivoted and hunched his body over Teferi to protect him.</p>

<p>Jaya bathed the room in fire. Phyrexian monstrosities—dozens of them, too many—screeched in agony. The cries died into despairing bubbling, into whimpering, then silence. The flames roasted Karn's back, scorching the blood and guts onto his metal body.</p>

<p>"Clear," Jaya said.</p>

<p>Karn lifted himself to his feet.</p>

<p>"Karn, thank you." Teferi patted the top of his hair and found it unsinged.</p>

<p>Jodah, his arm slung over Stenn's neck, joined them. Jodah seemed drained. He scanned the debris in the room—it had once been an office, complete with filing cabinets.</p>

<p>"This involves far, far more than one creature," Jodah said.</p>

<p>"You're right." Stenn slunk out from under Jodah's arm. "We use a lot of Thran technology in Argivia, and it looks like the Phyrexians have<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> co-opted it somehow. Integrated into it. The thing's tendrils have spread throughout the entire watchtower."</p>

<p>Karn examined Teferi's wound. He needed medical attention. "Perhaps we must consider lowering the barrier in order to obtain a physician for Teferi. He is gravely wounded."</p>

<p>"Have you determined that we're all safe?" Teferi asked.</p>

<p>"Can he afford to?" Jodah said. "He could wait. He could second-guess himself forever. He could test us all a thousand times. How could he ever know? How could anyone?"</p>

<p>Jaya said, "I think we should eradicate any Phyrexians within the tower before lowering the barrier. If that creature so easily integrated itself into a single tower, what might it do to a city?"</p>

<p>"What do you think we should do?" Stenn asked.</p>

<p>"Go to the powerstone," Jaya said. "Let's root this out. At its source."</p>

<p>Teferi grimaced. "If someone can get me up there, I'm game to follow Jaya's plan. We might as well try."</p>

<p>"I can carry you," Karn said.</p>

<p>Teferi gave him a long look, then sighed.</p>

<p>"It's decided," Jodah said.</p>

<p>Jaya cackled. "Oh, you've been waiting all night to be the one to say that, haven't you?"</p>

<p>Jodah still had enough energy left in him to look annoyed. Karn shook his head at their exchange and knelt to lift Teferi—carefully.</p>

<p>In the uppermost chamber, the powerstone's glow dominated the claustrophobic space, shining directly down into the central pedestal's control panel and filling the small circular room with its sickly yellow light. The arched windows ringing the room were still tightly shuttered with steel. Karn wished he could open one and feel the night's cool air on his body. He found a metal access panel and popped it open. The powerstone seemed integrated into a wire nest, which no doubt connected to the lockdown system, the boiler room, the vents, and everything else in the tower. Stenn pressed himself close to the panel to look. "It's worse than I thought."</p>

<p>Karn glanced at Stenn. He had told each Planeswalker a false location for the sylex, but he had not yet tested Stenn. He spoke, low enough that the others would not hear. "I need to confide the sylex's location. If I am damaged and cannot reach it, the knowledge cannot be lost."</p>

<p>"I understand," Stenn said, solemn. He did not seem at all perturbed. His focus lay on the wires in the walls.</p>

<p>"Should that happen," Karn said, "you are to determine which among the Planeswalkers you can trust so that the sylex can be brought to New Phyrexia in order to destroy the Phyrexians at their center. I hesitate to ask this, as it would involve asking a Planeswalker to sacrifice themselves to repair my mistake<nbsp> . . .</nbsp>"</p>

<p>"It would be an immense responsibility," Stenn said.</p>

<p>Karn pretended reluctance, then spoke. "I concealed it in the ruins of Trokair, on Sarpadia."</p>

<p>"That's all I needed," Stenn said. His voice, a sudden hiss, sounded horribly familiar.</p>

<p>Stenn threw his robes from his shoulders. Surgery lines, previously invisible, deepened in his skin. The buttons on his shirt popped free as his chest seemed to swell and swell—only to burst, butterflying open, ribs splayed. Iron cords poured from his torso's cavity rather than intestines, weeping mucus and blood. His face, before all this horror, seemed ecstatic—as if he had finally found his purpose and fulfilled it. He raised his head, his eyes focused upward, his lips moving as in prayer. Hand-like claws emerged from his eyes and reached around his skull, to grip it. His metallic intestines slithered across the floor, hooking into the Thran powerstone, and his entire body stiffened. The powerstone's light throbbed, then dimmed, as Stenn consumed its energy. His mouth gaped, frozen in a voiceless whisper.</p>

<p>He had converted his entire body into an antenna, Karn realized, and transmitted his hard-won knowledge to Sheoldred, confiding in her the sylex's location.</p>

<p>Its false location.</p>

<p>"Stop him," Teferi grunted. He clutched at his gut wound, and his eyes brightened with anger. "Don't let him—"</p>

<p>Jaya lunged forward, her hands outthrust. Fire blazed.</p>

<p>Stenn did not spare her a glance. His bloody wires reared up from the ground, debris sticking to their gore, and wrapped themselves around her like anacondas, binding her hands and pinning them to her sides. Jaya, unable to use her magic without searing herself, struggled against Stenn to free her hands. But she couldn't breathe. Her face blued.</p>

<p>Karn charged toward her. Fast as he tore fibers away from her body, more writhed into place. Small tight lines threaded themselves between his fingers, defying him. Jaya's eyes seemed so wide, so panicked.</p>

<p>Teferi sat up and readied his magic, but his spell, cast in such a weakened state, did little more than flicker into a nebulous blue haze before fading. Teferi moaned and sagged back onto the floor. The blood soaking his garments deepened in color as it wicked through the cloth. Jodah ran to Teferi's side, muttering a healing spell under his breath.</p>

<p>"We have to get out of here!" Jodah shouted.</p>

<p>Karn agreed. The control panel had a straightforward layout. He inserted the key Stenn had given him into the pedestal. He opened up a metal lid, then flipped the toggle. The steel shutters jolted upward, the chain within the walls rattled, and gears ground. Cool night air poured into the tower. But along with that fresh air came noises: gibbering and shrieks, from the city below.</p>

<p>Karn could not free Jaya from the cables writhing around her, so he turned. He dismembered Stenn—no, not Stenn, the Phyrexian who had killed Stenn, who had compleated him and taken his place—with efficiency. He tried not to think about his actions: he removed bones from sockets, and tossed the pieces aside, as easily as stripping a chicken at a banquet.</p>

<p>Jaya inhaled, her breath a rasp that carried through the dark, and then blasted not-Stenn with a gout of scarlet flame. The fire poured over Karn and sizzled across not-Stenn's flesh, frying his organic components.</p>

<p>The Phyrexian sagged to the floor, a collection of blackened metal and crisped organics. Jodah looked up at Jaya. His hands lay outstretched over Teferi's stomach. "I'm too exhausted to heal him. I can keep him from bleeding out, but that's about it. We need help."</p>

<p>"It is time that I call the <em>Weatherlight</em>," Karn said.</p>

<p>"Why don't we give it a few more minutes? Until things are really desperate?" Jaya said.</p>

<p>Karn opened the summoning amulet like a locket. He flipped the toggle inside.</p>

<p>Shanna's voice, quiet and tinny, piped up. "What is it, Ajani?"</p>

<p>"This is Karn. Jodah, Teferi, Jaya, and I need to be brought to safety. Teferi is wounded."</p>

<p>There was a pause from the other end. "Your location?"</p>

<p>"Argivia. In the watchtower. Under attack by Phyrexians."</p>

<p>"Phyrexians?" Karn could hear the <em>Weatherlight </em>creaking in the winds. When she spoke again, her voice sounded calm and determined: "You're in luck—we're not far. If the winds favor us, we'll be there soon."</p>

<p>"Understood."</p>

<p>"See you soon. Shanna out."</p>

<p>The Phyrexian noises seemed to be getting closer; echoing through the vents, between the walls, squeaks and burbles punctuated mechanical clicks and fleshy rustles. The entire tower was infested—perhaps even the entire city. Stenn had overseen rooting out Phyrexian agents in Argivia. It was fair to assume he had done the exact opposite.</p>

<p>"Teferi is too wounded to move. We must hold out until Shanna arrives," said Karn. "Jaya, you seem to be in the best shape among us. You will lead. I will take up a central position as I must defend Teferi. Jodah, keep watch at the rear."</p>

<p>Jodah opened his mouth. Jaya lit two fireballs in her hands. She weighed them and raised her eyebrows at Jodah. Jodah, abashed, closed his mouth.</p>

<p>After a moment, he spoke, mild: "I was going to say that this is an excellent plan."</p>

</div>

<p>Time trickled away more slowly than the grains of sand settling between the rocks. The fine particles sifted into Karn's joints. He didn't know how long he had lain there, pinned in the dark. Was it days or weeks that had passed? What if months had flown away, like a small and startled bird? What if it was longer? Years, decades, eons—</p>

<p>No, he could not think of it.</p>

<p>No one would miss him. No one knew where he had gone. He should have told someone. He should have at least told Jhoira. Or Jaya. If he had told them, they would have known where to search and either freed him or seen the Phyrexians themselves.</p>

<p>What if the Phyrexians were the ones to find him? Would it be worse if no one found him? He might wait alone, forever in the darkness. In the silence.</p>

<p>Sand trickled down. A scrabbling noise. Maybe claws grating on rough stone.</p>

<p>A weight lifted away from his hand, exposing it to the chill air currents. He could move his fingers. Relief shot through him, a pang more powerful than the Blind Eternities. He stretched his fingers, marveling at the freedom of this small movement, the ability to make <em>any</em> movement. Something warm and soft touched his fingertips. Organic, impenetrable to his senses. Not Phyrexian. Gentle. Thoughtful.</p>

<p>He was found.</p>

<p>The warmth left his fingertips. Had his rescuer departed?</p>

<p>The scratching quickened. Rocks grated. Pebbles cascaded. Clunks as large rocks tossed away landed. The burden on him lightened. Karn strained. The material around him budged, shifting at the pressure of his enormous strength. Karn exercised the powerful mechanisms in his torso, pushing himself upright. Rocks poured away. He heaved himself up slowly. He wanted to take care not to hurt his rescuer with any stray stones.</p>

<p>As his efforts increased, the scratching noise ended. Footfalls retreated as his rescuer stepped clear. Karn would have to trust that they had moved to a safe distance.</p>

<p>Karn hauled himself to his feet. Stone poured off him, and he was free. The warm air caressed his body. He rolled his shoulders, reveling in their movement. The tumbling rock kicked up a gray haze. He shook the fine particles from his body and wiped clean his eyes.</p>

<p>Ajani stood in the tunnel, his fur a striking white in the torchlight. The pupil of his unscarred pale-blue eye glinted with the nocturnal hue of a nighttime predator. His shoulders had a proud set to them, like he was pleased he'd found Karn. He granted Karn a friendly, close-lipped smile.</p>

<p>Karn nodded, tentative. He'd only met Ajani a few times. For Ajani's species, baring teeth was a hostile action, so this small smile was friendlier than a broad human grin.</p>

<p>"How did you find me?" Karn cleared his throat. It, too, felt dusty. The mechanism inside it clicked uncomfortably. "I told no one I was here."</p>

<p>Ajani coughed, awkward, deep in his chest. "After you didn't answer the letters, Jhoira became<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> worried about you. She asked Raff to place a tracking spell on the letters, one that would only activate when you—and only you—opened the envelope. That's how I located your camp."</p>

<p>Karn stilled, embarrassed. Had Jhoira known every time he'd read a letter and left it unanswered? Every time he'd pushed aside the paper heaps on his worktop to make room for a new project? Had Ajani seen the chaotic clutter that populated his workspace? Karn would have never let his camp descend to such a state if he'd expected a visitor.</p>

<p>He evaded Ajani's gaze and investigated the joints in his body for damage. Ah, the spearhead. He'd forgotten he'd left that lodged in him.</p>

<p>"Every time you moved the letters, Jhoira knew you were alive," Ajani said, "and didn't want to talk. She was determined to give you the time you needed, and not to press you. She knows how private you can be when you are<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> upset."</p>

<p>Karn worked at the spearhead, trying to remove it from his body. The rockfall had jammed it even deeper into him.</p>

<p>"But when you stopped shuffling the letters around," Ajani continued, "she grew concerned. And here I am."</p>

<p>Karn grunted. He wiggled the spearhead back and forth, trying to loosen it from between his torso plates. His blunt fingers, though capable of the most detailed work, couldn't dig deep enough. He still couldn't believe Jhoira had known how often he'd looked at those letters, considered replying, and then set them aside. Too many times. "Jhoira is well?"</p>

<p>"She is in her workshop on the Mana Rig." Ajani shrugged.</p>

<p>"And the <em>Weatherlight</em>?"</p>

<p>"She returned the <em>Weatherlight</em> to its rightful owner," Ajani said. "Shanna captains it."</p>

<p>"Ah, good. Shanna will rise to the task." Karn had served with Sisay and was pleased to see the airship in her descendant's hands. "Do you mind if I<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> ?" Ajani nodded at the spearpoint.</p>

<p>Karn shrugged.</p>

<p>Ajani was not as tall as Karn, but he was tall enough that he had to bend his head to inspect the spearhead. He inserted his claws into Karn's joints with surprising delicacy. "You know, every Planeswalker goes through phases like this. We withdraw, especially if we have played a role in changing a plane's fate. I have seen it time and time again. After a great hunt, you feast, and you sleep. It's natural, and there is no shame in that."</p>

<p>"I do not feast, and I do not sleep," Karn said.</p>

<p>"That does not mean you don't need to recuperate." Ajani eased the spearhead from Karn's body.</p>

<p>Karn had never been permitted to "recuperate" when Urza had loosed him as a war machine. Urza had explained it was unnecessary and, indifferent to Karn's weariness, had turned his attention to other, more interesting projects.</p>

<p>Ajani examined the spearpoint. Its metal glimmered a sickly green in the dimness. "You encountered more than a rockfall. What happened here, my friend?"</p>

<p>Karn didn't wish to answer the question—not until he knew whether he could trust Ajani. The vision he'd had upon touching Sheoldred still thrummed within him—Phyrexian agents everywhere, hidden across Dominaria. Waiting. "How long have I been buried?"</p>

<p>"A few months," Ajani admitted. "It took time to locate you."</p>

<p>Months lost. Months that could have been spent preparing.</p>

<p>Sheoldred's segmented parts had skittered along his paralyzed arms, down his back; spiderlike, they had poured over him. She would have had ample time to reassemble herself. Rona as well, he was sure.</p>

<p>"You have damaged yourself." Karn nodded at Ajani, whose claw had torn at the cuticle, a wound that had most likely occurred when he had dug Karn out from the rockslide. "Let us return to my camp for supplies. I must also check the sensitive equipment there to verify that it is still functional."</p>

<p>Karn did not voice what he feared most: did he still have the sylex and the clay tablet?</p>

<hr />
<p>In the months Karn had been buried, his campsite had remained undisturbed but not unchanged; the small tents had gone dingy with mildew.</p>

<p>Ajani hunched his shoulders. He had a Planeswalker's distaste for these caves. Even if one could not directly sense the interplanar technologies, their way of warping time made the space claustrophobic. Karn, too, could feel the pressure.</p>

<p>Karn led Ajani through his cluttered camp, then ducked into his main tent. The box holding the sylex and the tablet remained where he'd left it and appeared to be locked. Karn ignored it, conscious of Ajani's eyes on him.</p>

<p>Karn located a barrel with water—potable, though he normally used it for cleaning purposes—and a rag. He handed the rag to Ajani, to wash and wrap his wound.</p>

<p>"Why were you here, Karn?" Ajani rinsed his hand, working out the grit that had lodged in his wound.</p>

<p>Karn inventoried his equipment for damage as he replied. "Searching for artifacts. Due to the unique properties of the Caves of Koilos, not even the most entrepreneurial archeologists or enthusiastic researchers have plundered them." He made his way in a circuit around the tent, toward the box where he'd hidden the sylex and its tablet. Casually. The box seemed intact, but he dared not open it. He reached out with his special senses. The tablet felt like mere clay, a combination of aluminum, silicon, magnesium, sodium, and other trace elements. The sylex buzzed at him: present but indecipherable due to its powerful magic.</p>

<p>Karn set the box aside. He faced Ajani and related all he had seen.</p>

<p>"Sheoldred escaped?" Ajani paced in the tent's confines. "Karn, we must warn—"</p>

<p>"I have tried," Karn said. "Many times."</p>

<p>"Now you have seen Sheoldred."</p>

<p>Karn wished he could trust Ajani, but he shook his head. "The caves where I discovered the Phyrexian staging ground are no longer accessible. I have no proof that the Phyrexians have returned to Dominaria."</p>

<p>"Don't we?" Ajani held out the spearhead. "Karn, there is a peace summit between the Keldons and the Benalish. If any nations will take the Phyrexian return seriously, it's those two. I propose we speak to their leaders."</p>

<p>Ajani was right. Of all the nations in Dominaria, Keld and New Benalia were likeliest to listen to Karn's warning. Radha, the leader of the Keldons, had reforged that rugged nation of warriors into a devastating military force. Aron Capashen led New Benalia's knights, whose passion for justice made each one worth a dozen fighters. "Let me gather my finds and sensitive equipment before we go."</p>

<p>Ajani tapped an amulet hanging from his belt. "Jhoira gave me a summoning device for the <em>Weatherlight</em> before she sent me. Shanna will honor it."</p>

<p>"The <em>Weatherlight </em>may be a speedy ship, but she is not quick enough." Karn stacked several devices on the chest that held the sylex and the tablet and loaded everything into a rucksack. "I propose that we planeswalk."</p>

<hr />
<p>Karn did not know how other Planeswalkers perceived the Blind Eternities, but to him the interminable space felt like crushed velvet, its lukewarm prickle sometimes verging on pain. The vertigo plunging through Karn contrasted with the sense that he wasn't moving at all, which was at odds with the feeling that he pulled himself along a cord to an unknown destination. He burst through a silken gash into cool air.</p>

<p>Karn stood knee-deep in wild grasses, orange poppies, and purple-flowering thistles. Inland, the farms seemed young, recently cleared land holding fields yellow with blooming canola. The homesteads bled into mountains, the misty temperate rainforests punctuated with emerald alpine meadows.</p>

<p>If he had been human, he would have taken a single shuddering breath.</p>

<p>To his other side, a large stone statue protected a seaport whose buildings and streets were carved into white chalk cliffs. Eons ago, a Phyrexian portal ship must have decapitated the statue, and the decrepit hulk lay atop the statue's neck. Overgrown with honeysuckle, it shadowed the city's colorful awnings. In the center of the bay, a worn-smooth island protruded from the water—the statue's head, now home to seabirds.</p>

<p>Ajani led Karn down narrow paths past modest homes carved into the chalk. These seemed small and well worn in contrast to the newly sculpted city hall, which had large but chunky dimensions, wide windows, and balconies framed with ornate columns.</p>

<p>"Do you know where the peace talks are occurring?" Karn asked.</p>

<p>Ajani paused and cocked his head. "Follow the sound of arguing, I suppose."</p>

<p>Karn could hear nothing. The leonin's senses had to be spectacular.</p>

<p>Ajani led Karn through a grand but empty reception area, then up a narrow set of stairs. The corridors linking the rooms felt claustrophobic, lit only by torches. They pushed between brass-bound double doors into a light-filled room dominated by a long granite table. A broad balcony overlooked the sea, and a male varied thrush—orange breast with a black collar, black mask, and black cap, a beautiful creature—perched on its railing.</p>

<p>To one side sat the representatives of House Capashen of Benalia. The nobleman at the table—Aron Capashen, a middle-aged man with light ochre skin—had a proud tower with seven colored windows embroidered onto his silks. The knights arrayed behind him, their silver armor chased with gold, their stained-glass shields held at the ready, possessed the same gilded motif on their breastplates.</p>

<p>To the other side lounged the large, gray-skinned Keldon warriors with their heavy leather armor and their heavier weapons. Their warlord—Radha—sat opposite the Capashen nobleman. She had a Keldon's ash-colored skin, black mane, and bulky muscles, but the pointed ears and blue markings of a Skyshroud elf.</p>

<p>Other officials, led by a man from New Argive who had fair skin and a black goatee, lined the sides of the granite negotiation table between the two conflicting parties.</p>

<p>Ajani and Karn must have arrived as the negotiations were set to begin, because only a moment later both Jodah and Jaya arrived. Jodah portaled in, stepping through a door his magic sliced into the air. His office, cluttered with books and bric-a-brac, vanished when the portal slid closed. Jaya planeswalked into the room, appearing with a flash and the smell of charcoal.</p>

<p>"It's been a while, old man." Jaya gave Jodah a friendly embrace.</p>

<p>With his boyish features and shaggy brunette hair, Jodah could have been Jaya's grandson, even though he was thousands of years her senior. "Come for the family silver?"</p>

<p>"Oh, there's nothing silver here that I like enough to keep—except for my hair. I've already checked your pockets. Thought about taking up lint farming?"</p>

<p>Jodah smiled. "I'm not worried. Your tongue is quicker than your fingertips."</p>

<p>Jaya's gaze fell on Karn and Ajani. "Well, this is a surprise. Are you two here to work on the negotiations as well?"</p>

<p>Ajani regarded Jaya, solemn. "We must speak to you regarding what Karn has seen in the Caves of Koilos. The Phyrexians have returned to Dominaria."</p>

<p>The idle small talk at the negotiation table dropped into shocked silence. Jodah and Jaya exchanged looks, then turned their attention to Karn. The Keldons, Benalish, and Argivians broke into argument, the overlapping dialects and accents turning their fears into babble. Only the Benalish knights remained at their posts, their rigid posture a testament to their discipline.</p>

<p>Jaya had paled. "It hardly seems possible."</p>

<p>"I have walked this plane for millennia," Jodah said, "and I have read the stories, examined the histories. I have visited the ruins: I tell you this not to boast but so that you know I speak the truth—the Phyrexians cannot traverse the Blind Eternities."</p>

<p>"Sheoldred has traveled between planes—" Karn said.</p>

<p>"Only Planeswalkers can do that now." Jodah pinched the bridge of his nose. "If I recall, Karn, that is a reality you helped usher in." His age—similar to Urza's, when Urza had created Karn—overwrote his young features with exhaustion. Karn could not believe Jodah would deny the truth, not when Karn had seen Sheoldred. Perhaps most Phyrexians could not survive the journey through the Blind Eternities, but Sheoldred had: even if it had burned away her organic materials, even if it had damaged and weakened her, somehow she had succeeded.</p>

<p>Aron Capashen stood and paced. He seemed agitated. "The Phyrexians are ancient history. I cannot see what you would have to gain by asserting this."</p>

<p>"I located a staging ground for a new invasion," Karn said, "led by one of New Phyrexia's leaders, a praetor named Sheoldred. The Society of Mishra serves her, and the Phyrexians are compleating dozens of ordinary citizens. We cannot know how many Phyrexians are stationed throughout Dominaria's nations. They may even be among us now."</p>

<p>"Have I not been warning you of this?" The young nobleman from New Argive stood. Based on his gold-embroidered and fur-lined finery, he had to be an important official. "Phyrexian sleeper agents will permeate every layer of society if we do not act now. For all we know, they already have!"</p>

</div>

<p>"Stenn, your alarmist tendencies are not helping," Jodah said. "Karn, where are the Phyrexians now?"</p>

<p>The varied thrush fixed a beady eye on him as if curious about his answer.</p>

<p>Karn did not have an answer. "They evacuated while I was incapacitated. I do not know."</p>

<p>Jodah sighed. "The diplomatic situation is too sensitive to halt negotiations now. If you knew where they were, this would be a different matter, but without stronger information, like a location, how could we act to root them out?"</p>

<p>"And even if the Phyrexians were on Dominaria," Jaya said, "historically they've divided before they conquered. If we leave this conflict between Benalia and the Keldons unresolved, we'd play right into their hands."</p>

<p>The thrush hopped along the railing.</p>

<p>"Karn, are you listening to me?" Jodah asked.</p>

<p>Karn returned his attention to Jodah. He placed the spearhead on the table. "I am."</p>

<p>"I have seen weapons from the Society of Mishra before," Jodah said, mild.</p>

<p>"When has Karn ever lied?" Ajani growled. "If he says he saw Sheoldred compleating people, then we are in danger."</p>

<p>"I believe you," Aron said. "But I cannot send my soldiers chasing whispers and rumors across Dominaria. Between the hostilities with the Keldons and fighting off the Cabal's resurgence, I don't have the fighters."</p>

<p>"His troops have the same engagements as mine." Radha laughed, a short bark. "I suppose we have found common ground in that."</p>

<p>Jodah glanced between Radha and Aron. "The Phyrexians haven't been a threat for centuries. I know that your memory is long, Karn. As is mine. If we address today's issue—the conflict between the Capashens and the Keldons—we can then discuss redeploying those same soldiers to fight the Phyrexians."</p>

<p>So many people had screamed in Sheoldred's lair, their voices thin and their pain sharp beneath the ecstatic orisons to her glory. "What of the lives Sheoldred now takes?"</p>

<p>Jodah placed his hand on Karn's shoulder. "We may not be talking about something as grand as an interplanar invasion, but lives are being lost to this conflict. They matter, too."</p>

<p>"We will go with you, Karn," said Jaya. "We will search for them. But now? Let us focus on the task at hand."</p>

<p>Karn could feel the room's attention swing back to the table, and the negotiations.</p>

<p>The thrush flew away.</p>

<p>"Stenn," Jaya said, "have someone show Karn and Ajani to the guest quarters."</p>

<hr />
<p>Karn's room was simple, its furniture basic but well crafted: a bed, a large table with two chairs, and a washstand with a porcelain basin in it. Karn pushed the bed to one side and moved the table into the room's center. He unloaded his backpack, taking care to ensure the sylex, still in its case, was secure.</p>

<p>"The most coherent argument Jodah and Jaya had against assisting us," Karn said, "was that we do not know where the Phyrexians are. If we can determine their location, then we will be able to persuade Jodah and Jaya to help."</p>

<p>"And perhaps the others as well." Ajani paused, his powerful body coiled. "How?"</p>

<p>"A scrying device." Karn lifted his hand above the tabletop. He generated first the viewing plane, a copper sheet covered in crystal. He filled the narrow layer between the two materials with liquid. The device's remainder, a complex assemblage of mechanical parts, required his concentration. His body buzzed with the magic coursing through him.</p>

<p>Ajani watched him, the pale blue of his unscarred eye attentive. "What is that?"</p>

<p>"It is for viewing remote locations." Karn let pride seep into his voice. He'd developed the plan for it himself, and he knew of no other device that could perform similarly. Karn focused on Jhoira. Not on her face. Not on her physical presence, but on her essence, the qualities that made her <em>Jhoira</em>. How she always saw through a person's circumstances to their essence. How she was willing to give everyone the benefit of a doubt.</p>

<p>The Mana Rig resolved within the crystal. At first fuzzy, the image filled with depth, then color. Perched upon a cliff's edge in Shiv's brutal desert, the metal structure had the size and complexity of a small city. The image tightened into a single location, a workshop with Jhoira in it. She sat at a workbench, her head bent, bronze hair bound and falling between her shoulder blades. She flipped a disconnected toggle back and forth as if thinking.</p>

<p>"Can you view Sheoldred?" Ajani asked.</p>

<p>All too easily could Karn visualize Sheoldred: her humanoid torso rising from her scorpion-like body; her voice, intimate and resonant inside his head. <em>Karn</em><nbsp><em> . . .</em></nbsp><em> such plans.</em></p>

<p>The scryer's image dissolved into mistiness. Karn leaned back on his heels. Ajani glanced at Karn. "They must have protections in place to prevent us from scrying them."</p>

<p>"A sensible precaution." Unfortunately.</p>

<p>Ajani pulled the amulet from his belt that could summon the <em>Weatherlight</em>. He placed it in Karn's palm. "You'll need this."</p>

<p>Karn examined the amulet. It seemed a straightforward device. "I can twin this."</p>

<p>Ajani smiled, his lips closed. "Even better."</p>

<p>Karn extended his senses into the amulet. He reproduced it, the metal coiling up from his fingertips to form an identical amulet. Ajani clipped the original to his belt while Karn manufactured a chain for his copy. Karn hung the amulet from his neck, feeling odd about the adornment. Normally he eschewed such things.</p>

<p>A varied thrush perched on Karn's windowsill, behind Ajani's shoulder.</p>

<p>If Karn could draw the Phyrexians out, he would not need to find them. He'd know where they were. The Phyrexians wanted to neutralize Dominaria's most powerful weapons. That included the sylex. He would use news of its presence to lure them into the open. But first he had to hide the sylex somewhere safe.</p>

<p>"Perhaps if we could speak to Jaya alone," Ajani suggested, "we could persuade her. She is no diplomat at heart."</p>

<p>Karn stared at the varied thrush, so still, so attentive. "Perhaps."</p>

<hr />
<p>Karn let himself into the negotiations. Stenn was setting an inkwell on the granite table as Jodah and Jaya gave both Radha and Aron Capashen quill pens. He did not wish to interrupt before they signed. The sea breeze poured over the balcony, cool with springtime's edge.</p>

<p>"You are an impressive leader," Aron said. "I am proud to enter this new era with you."</p>

<p>Radha smiled. "You do like to talk fancy."</p>

<p>"And you like to be mistaken for a brute," Aron Capashen said. "Anyone who takes you for a simple warrior must soon regret it."</p>

<p>Jodah smiled. "Radha, Aron will bring this agreement to the other houses to present for ratification. I will accompany him to ensure that this process is accomplished within the next few months, during which all hostilities in the Ice Rime Hills will cease."</p>

<p>Radha put up her hands, conceding. "Yes, yes. The sacred sites aren't worth any more war—no matter what artifacts they might contain."</p>

<p>A breeze stirred the room as a pale-blue bead of light formed midair. The light whorled outward into a disc that brightened into azure as Teferi stepped through the vortex. He'd aged well: his shoulders had broadened with middle age, gray threaded his hair, and his umber skin had health's warm blush to it.</p>

<p>"Another Planeswalker?" Aron sat back in his chair, exasperated.</p>

<p>"It must be a sign of interesting times," Radha said.</p>

<p>Jodah stood. "What's happened?"</p>

<p>"It's the Phyrexians—they were on Kamigawa." Teferi closed his eyes and shook his head. "Given what Kaya told me of what she saw on Kaldheim—"</p>

<p>"They can travel between planes," Jaya said, lips drawn tight.</p>

<p>After a moment, Jodah said, "That is alarming, to say the least."</p>

<p>Had not Karn explained this to both Jaya and Jodah? He had seen this, with his own eyes. He felt Sheoldred's touch on his body, in his mind. Yet Teferi had arrived, bearing secondhand news, and Jodah and Jaya believed his assertions? Where were their requests for "proof of a location" now?</p>

<p>Karn might as well have been a statue for all the regard they had given him. And the threat Teferi had warned them of wasn't even <em>on</em> Dominaria.</p>

<p>But none of that mattered. Only one fact remained relevant: "If the Phyrexians have traveled between multiple planes, then their invasion plans are much more widespread and well-coordinated than we anticipated."</p>

<p>Radha tensed. "Then we must fight."</p>

<p>Aron shook his head. His knights seemed restless, hands twitching toward their swords as if they expected to launch into action. "I never would have thought I'd live to see another Phyrexian invasion."</p>

<p>"The true Twilight has come," one of Radha's warriors hissed. "How can we battle such creatures?"</p>

<p>"However bad it is," Stenn said, "what will come is worse."</p>

<p>Jodah gave Jaya his calmest "help me" expression. Jaya flapped her hand at Karn and Ajani, as if asking them to remove Teferi, the origin of this disruption. Radha and Aron had not signed—and this made it seem like they wouldn't. Jodah looked like he'd bitten down on a charged piece of aluminum.</p>

<p>"I have the feeling that my timing was less than immaculate," Teferi said.</p>

<p>"You don't say," Jaya said, and gave them a meaningful look.</p>

<p>"I am not certain about this mutual protection clause—" Aron began.</p>

<p>"It might be best to look to our own shores, our own peoples—" Radha said.</p>

<p>Karn ushered Teferi away toward the door. Teferi let him.</p>

<hr />
<p>As planeswalking had exhausted Teferi, Karn and Ajani led him to the suite adjacent to theirs.</p>

<p>Outside, spring rain pattered down against the cliffside. The rosemary plants growing from cracks in the stone scented the air that wafted through the unglazed windows. Did rosemary's scent please Karn because <em>he </em>liked it? Or because Urza had designed him to like it? Karn would never know.</p>

<p>Teferi always made Karn consider his origins. Not always comfortably.</p>

<p>"How is Niambi?" Karn asked.</p>

<p>"She's providing medical aid to the nomadic tribes in Jamuraa." Teferi's pride in his daughter radiated from him. "And Jhoira?"</p>

<p>"I have not spoken to Jhoira in some time." Karn wished that Urza had made his face with a human's mobility and its subtlety in micro-expressions so that it would be easier for him to signal to Teferi that he did not wish to speak about this.</p>

<p>Ajani glanced between Teferi and Karn as if the awkward silence stretching between them were visible, a piece of string tight enough to twang. "Something else is troubling you."</p>

<p>"I did not wish to say this before the Keldons and Benalish," Teferi admitted, "but they took Tamiyo. Even Planeswalkers might be vulnerable to them now<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> We waited too long, Ajani."</p>

<p>Ajani froze, shock plain across his face. "Tamiyo?"</p>

<p>Teferi nodded wearily. "We can discuss it after I've gotten some rest."</p>

<p>Karn watched as Ajani's hands curled into tight fists, anger and sorrow crossing his friend's face. He hadn't known they were close.</p>

<p>"I should rest as well," said the leonin after a moment.</p>

<p>Karn accepted this as his cue to depart. Back in his room, he opened the case with the sylex and the tablet in it. He removed the tablet, relocked the case, and set it on the table. He'd keep this here, to research it. But the sylex—that he needed to rehome.</p>

<p>Somewhere safe. And he knew just the place.</p>

<p>Karn pressed his palms to the scryer's crystal-covered copper. Jhoira's image appeared. She was no longer in her workshop but sleeping, her face crunched into her pillow, her reddish-brown hair lying in a messy braid across one cheek. Karn let her image fade.</p>

<hr />
<p>Evading the Oyster Bay guards was simple: the people here may have once made great pirates, but they had not adopted the organized banality of guard duty. Karn, large in the shadows, avoided any light that would glint from his body. He slipped through the town's carved streets, sticking to the darkness, up and around to the top of the cliff.</p>

<p>He hiked along the Phyrexian portal ship's spine, its degraded metal softened with wildflowers like purple asters and goldenrod, toward a hill blanketed in young vine maples. Ferns rustled at Karn's shins, and the damp air condensed on his body.</p>

<p>Now a sufficient distance to avoid tweaking Jaya and Jodah's senses, Karn stepped through the searing Blind Eternities, tearing a wound in it. The edges fluttered against his body. He passed through it to Shiv and the Mana Rig, straight into Jhoira's workshop. It held a breathless silence, like every instrument in it waited for Jhoira to wake.</p>

<p>Karn located a supply closet. He stowed the sylex and its case on the lowest shelf behind lengths of pipe whose dust promised that Jhoira had not needed them recently. He generated two devices: one alarm that would register if the pipes moved, and another weight-sensitive alarm that would notify him if anyone moved the box itself. There. The sylex was safe. Or as safe as it could be. Karn stepped back into the Blind Eternities.</p>

</div>

<p>Back on the forest hill, Karn wound his way downhill toward Oyster Bay. A light glimmered between the pale slender-trunked birch trees. A silhouetted person held aloft a lamp. Karn paused, but the lamp had glinted from his body. He had been seen. The figure moved closer. Stenn, the New Argivian noble from the negotiation table.</p>

<p>A nightjar called, its low warble traveling between the trees.</p>

<p>What if his precautions had not been enough?</p>

<p>"Out for a walk?" Stenn called.</p>

<p>"Yes," Karn said. "I do not sleep. You are awake late?"</p>

<p>"No, up early." As Stenn neared, his features grew clearer. His beard was trimmed and his hair tidy. "Dawn is the only time I truly feel safe. At peace. With the smell of baking bread wafting over the city, with the citizens starting to wake, I can imagine we aren't at war."</p>

<p>Morning had begun to whiten the sky. The air tasted like dew and cinnamon.</p>

<p>"I overheard the other Planeswalkers saying that you're immune to Phyrexian influence?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"This means you may be the only Planeswalker who can be trusted." Stenn's sable mantle beaded with water. "You aren't the only one who can read the signs of invasion. King Darien has tasked me with discovering Phyrexian agents. Obviously, this is not common knowledge."</p>

<p>"What will you do after you discover such an agent?" Karn asked.</p>

<p>"What must be done," Stenn said. "The only thing that can be done. Once someone is compleated—they are lost, whether they know it or not."</p>

<p>"They don't know themselves?"</p>

<p>"No," Stenn said. "I think they are more useful to the Phyrexians—and harder to discover—if they themselves do not know."</p>

<p>It made sense that those forced to act against their own interests, their families, and their very plane, would be kept oblivious of their own actions. The Phyrexians had to be inserting these unknowing sleeper agents everywhere. Yet to kill such people, people who had already been so wronged<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> King Darien must've selected Stenn for his ruthlessness.</p>

<p>"Have you ever caught such an agent?" Karn asked.</p>

<p>"No. Not yet." Stenn gazed at the dawn-glazed sea. Fishing boats skidded along the waves, tan sails belling. "Teferi's news frightened them."</p>

<p>Karn nodded. "They should be frightened. Do you think Benalia and Keld will unify?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," Stenn admitted, "but I do know that I can promise this: New Argive will mobilize. We will stand with you in defense of Dominaria."</p>

<p>Karn nodded, relieved that someone had taken him as a credible source. He had found his first ally willing to provide military support. "We can discuss the details later."</p>

<p>In town, few seemed wakeful—only bakers tucking yeasty loaves into ovens and children milking goats and feeding chickens. Sometimes, Karn imagined their pains: losing a pet rooster to the dining table, spilling a much-needed bucket of milk. Long after these people had died, Karn would continue to ponder their lives.</p>

<p>He felt old. Old, and tired. And the children's beautiful brevity seemed an unbearable tragedy in this still morning.</p>

<p>When Karn reached the city hall, Ajani was awake, pacing between banks of ropey wisteria vines. Ajani paused, his body quivering with tension, and his tail lashed once. Karn suspected this was not a voluntary gesture. He had seen how the leonin seemed to smother his non-human mannerisms when near humans. Ajani's blue eye caught the light in the dimness, pupil glinting a predator's green.</p>

<p>"Karn. Do you think the humans are awake yet?" Ajani asked. "Jodah and Jaya will sit the representatives down at the negotiation table once more today."</p>

<p>Karn could summon no patience for how Jodah continued to prioritize this small human conflict before the Phyrexian threat. "Some are. I encountered Stenn this morning, and he has pledged New Argive's forces."</p>

<p>"Then let us speak to Jaya," Ajani said, "before negotiations recommence."</p>

<hr />
<p>"You two would be much more compassionate toward me right now if you had heard of this substance called 'caffeine,'" Jaya muttered.</p>

<p>"I have heard of it," Karn said.</p>

<p>"It is vile," Ajani said.</p>

<p>Teferi entered the room and opened the doors to the balcony. The chilly sea breeze freshened the room, bringing with it springtime's rising birdsong. A seagull landed on the balcony and cocked its head, looking at Teferi's bread roll in a meaningful way. A varied thrush landed on the rail, then jumped along it. Could it be the same bird as yesterday? How could such a shy woodland bird, with its orange breast, tolerate a seagull?</p>

<p>"It isn't important who can charge what taxes at which border," Ajani said. "We should be prioritizing the fight against the Phyrexians."</p>

<p>"Correct." Karn eyed the thrush. "And keeping the sylex from Phyrexian hands."</p>

<p>"The sylex?" Ajani started. "You have it with you?"</p>

<p>"I had it in my possession," Karn said, "as I planned to deploy it on New Phyrexia and eradicate the Phyrexian threat at its source once I determined its workings."</p>

<p>"Karn, we agreed to handle that together. You can't go there alone," said Teferi, serious.</p>

<p>"You said yourself that we waited too long. All of you promised me your help, and then you told me to be patient. No longer," said Karn.</p>

<p>The thrush was not even pretending to peck at invisible crumbs.</p>

<p>Karn seized the bird. "I know what you are."</p>

<p>"Karn—" Jaya said.</p>

<p>The bird's chest peeled open and cables shot out. The cables, slick with blood and slime, wrapped themselves around Karn's head. Goo slipped down his skin and a maw at the tentacle's core searched along Karn's cheek for purchase, its teeth scraping down the smooth metal. Karn readjusted his grip around the creature's slippery body, trying to pull it from his face. But its wires had wrapped all the way around his head, locking together in a thick tangle at the nape of his neck. The creature's teeth caught on Karn's lip. It jabbed needle-like protuberances into him, like it wanted to inject him with some substance, and the needles snapped.</p>

<p>"It's too close to Karn," Jaya shouted. "I can't blast it."</p>

<p>"Let me—" Ajani said.</p>

<p>Slime sloughed off the creature and sizzled on Karn's skin, corroding his metal. It hurt. The creature snaked its tentacles between the joints on Karn's neck and around his collar, as if trying to prize him apart. Karn grunted and squeezed his fingers between the creature's slippery body and his face. He forced it off him, flinging it across the room where it smacked against the opposite wall and slid down. The creature caterpillar-crawled toward the door.</p>

<p>Teferi raised his hands, slowing the creature within a blurring field to prevent its rapid escape. Ajani lunged forward and pierced the creature with his claws, pinning it to the floor. It shrieked and writhed. Acid spurted from the wound.</p>

<p>Karn, face still steaming from the creature's corrosive slime, held out both hands, one over the other. He generated a bird cage, building it upwards until the bars united into a dome. Ajani ripped the monstrosity from the floor and flung it into the cage.</p>

<p>It rattled the bars, screeching.</p>

<p>Jaya crossed her arms. "Turns out Jodah has bigger things to worry about than taxes."</p>

<hr />
<p>Karn placed the Phyrexian bird on the granite negotiation table. Jodah leaned toward it, his eyes widening. The creature in the cage hissed at him. Aron Capashen looked sick. His Benalish knights had not moved, their discipline ironclad. Radha stared at it, eyes glittering. Her warriors had broken out into muttered prayers. Stenn's lips had thinned in satisfaction that his point was made.</p>

<p>"They're here," Jodah murmured. "Among us."</p>

<p>"I told you—" Stenn said.</p>

<p>Three of the Benalish knights exploded outward from their armor. Their eyes burst open in a shower of glistening black oil and their jaws distended, metal teeth emerging from their flesh to stud their gaping maws. Metallic fibers wriggled out from between the gaps in their armor. One of the creatures swung toward the granite table, his clawed hands drawn together in a double fist. It slammed its hands down on the granite table, cracking it in two.</p>

<p>"The negotiations are over," it said.</p>

<p>Its comrade seized Aron with its writhing tentacles, bundling him up like a spider would a fly.</p>

<p>Karn strode forward, Teferi and Ajani flanking him. Jaya held up her hands, summoning fire into her palms. Jodah gathered energy, distorting the air around him with ribbons of color, and then solidified it into a forcefield to protect the unchanged Benalish soldiers from the Phyrexians.</p>

</div>

<p>"For Gerrard," one woman bellowed, lifting her sword. She dodged past Jodah's barrier to charge her ex-comrades. The Phyrexian knight avoided her blow by splitting itself in two: it slid apart into two meaty pieces, legs sprouting from what had once been glistening internal organs. Both halves attacked.</p>

<p>"The first wind of ascension is Forger," Radha called, backing toward the door. She—like Aron—had come to the negotiation table unarmed.</p>

<p>"Burning away impurity!" Her warriors bellowed, forming up around her to protect her. They fought off the lashing tentacles that reached to seize her, chopping off the Phyrexians' limbs. But any appendage that hit the ground seemed to gain life of its own, sprouting legs and teeth, squirming toward the retreating Keldons.</p>

<p>The Argivians fell back, joining the Keldons, fighting with their rapiers, the weapons of nobles who had never seen battle and never expected to. Stenn himself only wielded a dagger. Separated from his people, he backed away between the shards of the broken table until he reached Jaya's wreath of protective flame. Karn had almost reached Aron.</p>

<p>The Phyrexian holding him released a low laugh like an opening steam valve. It rolled its body around Aron and bounded onto a neighboring balcony. Ajani snarled with frustration and launched himself after it.</p>

<p>Ajani! Karn could not follow—the balconies would break under his weight if he tried to leap after light-footed Ajani. Karn made a noise, low in his chest, with frustration, and took a step back. Teferi cursed.</p>

<p>"I can't jump that distance," Teferi said.</p>

<p>The Keldons had reached the door.</p>

<p>"I do not wish to leave you, Archmage," Radha shouted. "Keld stands with Dominaria—for Dominarians. We will battle this blasphemy alongside you, to defend all peoples."</p>

<p>"Go," Jodah shouted. "We will fight together another day!"</p>

<p>"There are too many of them," Karn said. "Blockade them in this room!"</p>

<p>Radha nodded once.</p>

<p>The brass double doors slammed shut, locking the Planeswalkers and the mage into the room with the Phyrexians.</p>

<p>Jaya swirled her hands up and around, blocking off the Phyrexians from Jodah, protecting him. Her flame burned white with a vicious heat. Karn had no doubt that Jaya's magic could defeat even this. He pushed himself through the heat. It seared the tentacles trying to wriggle into the joints of his body, ending them.</p>

<p>"Much as I'd love to do this all day," Jaya said, throwing a fireball at a writhing hunk of metal and flesh, "Jodah?"</p>

<p>"I have summoned the energy." Jodah's eyes were aglow with it, his skin incandescent. "But I need to know where to direct it to create the portal. A secure location."</p>

<p>"Argivia," Stenn gasped. He flicked a piece of tentacle off him with his blade and stomped on it. Blood and oil spurted beneath his boot, and he turned toward the next encroaching tentacle and speared it through. "New Argive's watchtower."</p>

<p>"It is as safe a place as any." Karn retreated toward Jodah, Teferi at his side.</p>

<p>Jodah's portal spun into existence behind him. It opened like a doorway cut into the air itself, revealing a small circular room.</p>

<p>Jodah retreated through it to sustain it from the other side.</p>

<p>"I'll hold them off," Jaya said, searing the writhing cables with her fire. "If you can get through the portal, I'll blast this room with such fire that not a single piece of Phyrexian will remain. Go!"</p>

<p>"My thanks," Stenn said. He backed through the portal as well.</p>

<p>"And mine as well," Teferi said, and vanished through the whirling vortex.</p>

<p>Jaya grinned in triumph as she raised her hands in a blaze of fire and set the whole room alight. The screams of the Phyrexians, wet and unnatural, whistled.</p>

<p>Karn stepped through the portal. The magic tingled across his skin and swallowed him, depositing him on the other side. A shape, airborne, flicked past him. Karn turned to search for it. He couldn't see any movement in the small room but for those who had arrived with him: Stenn, Jodah, Jaya, Teferi, and himself.</p>

<p>Jaya, last through the portal, joined Karn at his side.</p>

<p>Jodah closed the portal and collapsed, sagging to the ground. Transporting so many people was no easy feat—even for Jodah.</p>

<p>The humans all sat on the floor, sweating, panting, and bleeding, while Karn remained standing. He searched the room for the flickering shadow. The tower room had tiny arched windows ringing it and was empty but for a pedestal in the center, which seemed to have a control panel on it. Overhead a golden light shimmered through a crystal—no, not a crystal: a powerstone.</p>

<p>A shadow flitted across the powerstone's face.</p>

<p>"One followed us," Karn said.</p>

<p>"We must not let it escape. It could wreak havoc on the city." Stenn flipped a toggle on the central control panel. The watchtower thumped as gears ground to life. The walls' interiors echoed with the rattle of moving chains. Steel shutters and blast doors slammed shut, blocking out all light. The room instantly felt stuffier, more claustrophobic. Stenn handed Karn the key. "You are the only one who's incorruptible, so it's only right that you have it."</p>

<p>Jaya bumped her shoulder into Jodah's. "You never get tired of being right, do you?"</p>

<p>"The millennia may wear on, but no. No, I do not." Jodah's smile faded, and he turned to Karn.</p>

<p>"Nothing and no one may leave while the tower is in lockdown," Stenn said.</p>

<p>Teferi eyed the steel shutters. "We must capture and destroy the Phyrexian trapped here. And we must determine if any among us has been compromised. We need to know who we can trust before we can plan how to defeat them."</p>

<p>"Agreed," Jodah said.</p>

<p>The group checked the room. The small Phyrexian thing that had come with them had escaped the chamber. Karn surmised it must have squirreled itself away through some crack in the stone. He strung the key from the same chain he used to hang the scryer and the beacon to summon the <em>Weatherlight</em> and turned to face his companions. A frisson of unease traveled through his body, as if an electric current arced through him. Jodah, Jaya, Teferi, Stenn<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> How could he determine who he could trust?</p>

<p>If the Phyrexians were already on Dominaria, who could anyone trust?</p>

</div>

<p>Even from three caverns away, the shriek of breaking metal echoed against the stone. Yet another broken excavator. If Karn had been an organic being, he would have sighed. Instead, he only paused and listened to the excavator's lingering rattles. He pitied his machines: no single setting could accommodate the eccentric geology of the Caves of Koilos, where olivine rock was as likely to back into sandstone as cinnabar, but he had no alternative. Here, he'd find the secret to operating the sylex.</p>

<p>And he'd find it before any Phyrexian agent could.</p>

<p>Condensation beaded on his body, the droplets joining to slide down his metal plating. No one seemed to believe him, but he knew the truth. The Phyrexians were here, on Dominaria. He could feel it, like he could feel the stone and the interplanar technology riddling its layers.</p>

<p>He turned sideways to squeeze through a narrow passage. The basalt grated against his chest but gave way without scratching him. He ducked under translucent stalagmites into a low cave. Clear selenite coated the bones of Thran prisoners and fragmented Thran technologies, their gold traceries distorted.</p>

<p>Karn located the failed excavator to the rear of the cave.</p>

<p>The poor excavator steamed, as if vexed with its unmanageable job, and its overheated metal housing ticked with a soft <em>tink-tink-tink </em>as it cooled. Karn wove between the stalactites and water pools, careful not to break any of the delicate violet mineral deposits or disturb the freshwater anemones and tiny blind fish, bleached by a life that had, until now, passed in darkness.</p>

<p>Karn placed his hand on the excavator. "Shall I fix you, then? Yes?"</p>

<p>Steam sighed from the overheated machine. At his gesture, screws unwound themselves along their threading. He set them aside and removed the housing. A stripped-out gear greeted him. He removed it and set to generating a replacement. His fingers tingled with magic, its charge pulling together to generate something from nothing. Metal materialized, layer upon layer, to create a duplicate part.</p>

<p>He liked working in the caves' silence. In the sun's absence, only the water's metronome drip measured out his days. He was alone here; other Planeswalkers didn't like the interplanar distortion that rubbed at their senses in the Caves of Koilos. Karn didn't either, but he appreciated the isolation it gave him. He didn't have to answer questions. Or worry about whether the Phyrexians had gotten to someone. Compleated them. He could seek the key to operating the sylex in solitude. He would win the fight alone.</p>

<p>"What fight?" Jhoira had placed her hands on her hips in exasperation. "Karn, the Phyrexians were defeated centuries ago, and these new ones you told me about are trapped on their plane."</p>

<p>"They're here," Karn had told her. "Defeating the Phyrexians in combat means nothing. They aren't an army. They're hate embodied. They promise Dominaria's destruction."</p>

<p>Her voice had softened. "Just because Venser<nbsp> . . .</nbsp>"</p>

<p>Karn didn't want to think about Venser. He slipped the gear onto its shaft and tightened it down. He replaced the housing, sliding it into place, and then threaded in each screw. Small pleasures. He patted the excavator and smiled. "That's better, isn't it?"</p>

<p>He knew it wasn't alive, wasn't responding to him, but it almost felt like it was as he flipped a lever and watched the excavator move forward and begin digging into the cave wall. The stone shuddered. Fine white dust plumed away from the excavator's planed shovel-limbs. If organic beings had been present, Karn would have had to worry about using water to damp down the dust. Their lungs were so fragile.</p>

<p>Better that he was alone, wasn't it? No one held him back, eating and sleeping hours away. No one delayed his progress with chitchat.</p>

<p>The pulverized rock turned violet, then the excavator's rumble changed to a whine as it hit open air. The excavator stepped back, and Karn peered into the cavern it had opened.</p>

<p>The rock had been thin as an eggshell but extremely hard. On the other side, the cavern's interior was coated in opal. The glow from his eyes caught on the iridescent flecks, suffusing the cavern with an amber glimmer. The dust-coated workshop looked like it came from Urza's mortal lifetime, or even prior, when magic's theories and practices were less well known, and technology propelled Dominaria's progress forward. Intricate glass tubing, beakers of varying sizes, defunct burners, powdery remnants of ancient chemicals, wire cutters and rollers for clay, buckets coated with desiccated glazes, gears, and cogs—even a small, vented forge, tongs placed casually to one side as if its smith, interrupted, had walked away from a task undone. In one corner, shackles: a reminder that the Caves of Koilos once housed the ugliness of the Thran before it transformed into Phyrexia.</p>

<p>This workshop had been some artificer's sanctuary—and some prisoner's nightmare. Karn recognized a setup meant to exploit sentient beings for experimentation when he saw one. He'd seen too many such scenes when he'd been newly formed.</p>

<p>"How did all this survive so intact?" If only he could share this sight with someone—</p>

<p>He really had to stop talking to himself.</p>

<p>Karn stepped into the cavern as lightly as his heavy body permitted. What if a stray vibration caused these delicate objects to shatter, destroying data?</p>

<p>The books, arranged on a single long shelf with jewel-covered spines, tempted him with their knowledge, but he dared not take one down. The paper would probably crumble into dust should he touch it. He peeked into the beakers, tinted with dried-out fluids, and then examined the forge's ashes. Nothing. He examined the pottery worktop and saw it: a diagram of the sylex painted on parchment, a coppery bowl with handles and small black figures marching around its base. A gray slab of clay sat next to the diagram, etched with symbols duplicating those depicted in the diagram's faded paint. Some were in Thran; some in the arcing curves of an unrecognizable script that resembled some symbols on the sylex. The clay was damaged, partially illegible, and severed wires lay beside it. What had happened here?</p>

<p>"I must compare this to the sylex."</p>

<p>At the faint vibration of his words, the books collapsed into dust. Karn winced.</p>

<p>He gathered the unfired clay tablet into his hands—careful, careful—and eased out from the ancient workshop.</p>

<p>Karn had sited his basecamp some distance from the excavators, where the caves had greater stability. Each softly lit tent sheltered his equipment from the steady drip of water. Karn let their brightness guide his steps, the hollow cavern booming with his footfalls.</p>

<p>With the tents lit from within, coming back to camp almost felt like coming home. Karn ducked into the largest tent, stepping around the large, golden Thran artifact he'd left in front of the entrance. Inside, he shimmied past a broken piece of metal he had collected days ago, intending to reshape it back to usefulness. He stepped over a pile of powerstone shards and sat at his work desk; it, like the rest of his tent, was too cluttered—he had no space for his newest find. Atop the papers and small artifacts, he saw Jhoira's letters, scattered, opened but unanswered. <em>Karn, it's been months</em>, one letter began. <em>Don't you think you should examine why you're doing this? </em>Another letter ended. <em>Mirrodin </em><em>wasn't your fault</em>, she wrote in another. <em>Please come back. Venser would have<nbsp> . . .</nbsp></em></p>

</figure>
</div>

<p>Karn shifted the artifact onto one palm and used the other hand to shove Jhoira's letters to one side. He slid the artifact onto the worktop then ducked under the table. He'd concealed the sylex in a small titanium chest, its lock only accessible to someone like him, someone who both knew the order in which the tumblers and pins needed to be lifted and could manipulate inorganic materials. His lock had no key.</p>

<p>He placed his hand on the chest, focused, and felt the tumblers move. The lid popped open. He removed the sylex. Even his specialized senses could not identify its copper-like material. Normally he could reveal any inorganic object's mystery with a touch; not so the sylex. It made his palms itch with its strangeness. A Thran artifact, most said—but he had his doubts. It was Karn's belief that this device came from farther fields than simply the past.</p>

<p>He lifted its wide goblet body onto his desk. Its inky characters seemed to move under his worktop's light, transforming from Thran to Fallaji to Sumifan. The vessel's wide, bowl-like mouth seemed to call to be filled—with, according to the Sumifan, the memories of the land. He'd been reluctant to test it without confirmation on how to use it.</p>

<p>The sylex sent a jolt through him. Karn flinched and withdrew his hand, cradling it against his body.</p>

<p>Once, when he'd been new, he'd reached out and touched the fire blazing in Urza's hearth. He'd dropped the cherry-red coal, shocked by the sensation, then examined his hand for damage. He'd found none. He'd looked up to see Urza watching him with glittering eyes. Urza hadn't tried to stop him, yet he'd known this would hurt Karn. <em>Why did you give me intelligence if you do not value my personhood?</em> Karn had felt ashamed the moment he'd asked the question, and yes, Urza had chuckled. <em>You're more valuable to me if you can react intelligently. </em>Karn had stared at his aching, undamaged hand. <em>Then why give me pain? </em>Urza had smiled and stroked his white beard. Karn had later learned how to recognize that expression as one Urza made when he thought he was being particularly clever. <em>People are more reluctant to damage something if it causes that thing pain.</em></p>

<p>But that was only true of some people, wasn't it?</p>

<p>Karn glanced at Jhoira's unanswered letters. He did not dare involve Jhoira or the other Planeswalkers, lest he lose them to the Phyrexians like he'd lost Venser. Even after Memnarch renamed it, Karn still thought of that plane by its first name: Argentum. It had been Argentum to him when he'd created it and its smallest wonders. How beautiful it had been, a plane glimmering with mathematical precision.</p>

<p>The Phyrexians had taken it from him. His plane, his children. Memnarch, his creation.</p>

<p>And it was all his fault.</p>

<p>He grabbed a rag from a nearby pile to wipe the condensation from his body—he didn't want to drip on his new, unfired find—and dropped the rag back into the heap. He bent to study the sylex, comparing its symbols to those on the clay tablet. The pattern changed right where the clay tablet's edge seemed rougher. Broken. Had he forgotten a piece?</p>

<p>He needed to go back for it. Now. Since he'd opened the cavern to the caves' moisture, the artifacts in it would degrade.</p>

<p>Just then, the death rattle of another excavator echoed through the caverns. Karn wished he could sigh. But, as it was, he locked away the sylex and his most recent find. He'd repair the excavator—it was located near the ancient workshop anyway—and then he'd look for the missing piece.</p>

<hr />
<p>Oily smoke oozed up from the excavator's housing. It seemed to have hit a hard mineral deposit, stressing the mechanisms behind the cutting tools. Karn patted it. "More than you could cope with?"</p>

<p>The machine released a gout of smoke.</p>

<p>"I know the feeling," Karn replied.</p>

<p>Before getting started, he peered around the tunnel's edge. The nearby workshop, despite the excavator's rumblings, seemed intact. Good. The excavator could continue its work without risking damage to those artifacts, then. After he repaired it, he would search the workshop for the missing piece to the clay tablet.</p>

<p>He pulled the machine away and reached into the wall where it was digging.</p>

<p>He scooped out something<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> liquid. Oily black slop dripped down his fingers, spattering the ground. Could it be<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> ?</p>

<p>Karn reached with his special senses into the material. For him—he had tried to explain it to Jhoira once—this ability was akin to tasting, if tasting were to provide information beyond flavor. He felt nothing. As if this substance was organic.</p>

<p>How had the cables been embedded into stone? It looked almost like they'd woven themselves into it, like worms through an apple that was otherwise undisturbed.</p>

<p>He had been right: the oil was Phyrexian. He checked again—could these fibers be ancient remnants? "No, no," he murmured. "They look recent. Fresh."</p>

<p>Karn reached into the borehole and grabbed one of the fibers. It writhed under his fingers, resistant, and released small spider-like clamps from its body to grip the stone. The cable was alive. He frowned. It lashed his fingertips as if trying to wriggle free from his grip. He tugged hard and tore it free from its tunneled cavity.</p>

<p>Black oil spattered across his torso from its root. The other cables contracted within the wall—and the ceiling to the ancient workshop thundered to the ground. The tunnel behind Karn crumpled, the passage to his basecamp gone.</p>

<p>He had lost his findings.</p>

<p>He would never locate the shard of the unfired tablet. He would never slot it in and see what it revealed. He would never fully investigate the chamber and determine if it housed other secrets about the sylex's creation. This recent development had seen to that. Now he had a more urgent problem, one he needed to prioritize over archeological catastrophe: the Phyrexians were on Dominaria. Here, now.</p>

<p>He could try to excavate the workshop. He could dig out the passage and return to his basecamp. He could reach out to the others, but seeking help took time and, Karn knew, put others at risk. If he had learned anything during his long life, it was this: a single moment of inattention, of neglect, could leave an entire plane vulnerable to the Phyrexians. The Phyrexians were contained within the caves for now, and he with them. Good. He would not let Dominaria fall like Mirrodin once fell. He'd stop the Phyrexians. If he could not do that, he would obtain proof enough that he could recruit reinforcements. Proof enough that Jhoira, and his fellow Planeswalkers, would believe him.</p>

<p><em>Karn</em>, Jhoira would say, <em>you were right all along.</em></p>

<hr />
<p>Karn had only one direction he could go: forward. He stepped into the open Phyrexian tunnel. The walls looked organic, winding through the stone like veins through a body.</p>

<p>He followed the tunnel until it opened into a junction. Here, the walls had been carved into a frieze. Unlike the materials he had seen in the workshop and embedded behind translucent stone, these cuts seemed crisp and new. It had the vaulted quality Karn associated with religious practices, such as the stained-glass murals in Serra's temples.</p>

<p>In the frieze, a Phyrexian demon grasped a young human woman. The demon's elongated skull, bared teeth, and small eyes were depicted with loving detail. Each node of machinery and every exposed muscle fiber was polished until it gleamed. Small diamonds had been inset as highlights so that the demon seemed to move and glitter under Karn's gaze. In contrast, the human's profile, cut into the stone, was rough, her features drawn down into torment, revulsion, and fear. She held hands with another figure whose visage had been carved then intentionally defaced.</p>

<div class="figure-wrapper">

</figure>
</div>

<p>A whisper of cloth brushing stone drew Karn's attention. He turned, hand still pressed to the mural.</p>

<p>Humans always seemed so little to Karn. Only the tallest neared his height; all others were petite compared to him. These two—a man and a woman—were both small. The woman, her pale skin starved for sunlight and her brown hair ragged, had replaced her jaw with a hinged mechanism, small blades installed alongside her natural teeth. Where flesh joined metal, her scabs wept a sick, yellowish fluid. Her older companion, a white man with graying brittle blond hair, must have incorporated his technology more artfully: his white shirt lay open to expose the artificial heart beating between his ribs, the portal into his body protected with a glassy material. He had also added extra digits to his hands.</p>

<p>Both held chisels and large mallets. The sculptors, then. Acolytes from the Society of Mishra if their robes told him the truth. The female looked at Karn, then to his hand resting on the frieze, and shrieked in outrage. She launched herself forward. Her male companion followed her a second later.</p>

<p>She took a swing at his torso with the hammer. Karn seized her arm with one hand, and she drove her chisel toward the intricate, mobile plates along his abdomen. He grabbed her other arm. She grunted, straining against him. Her companion ran at Karn, raising his hammer over his shoulder. Karn swung the woman into her companion, slamming both into the wall. They fell in a tangle of limbs—nothing broken, just stunned—to the ground.</p>

<p>Karn bent over them and arranged their limbs. He held out his hands and generated restraints so that they could not attack him again. Iron particles buzzed at his fingertips, drawn from the aether. He called forth the metal in layers, building the restraints into bands on their arms and legs. He did not generate keyholes or a key, for he had no need to. The metal bands were solid.</p>

<p>The man moaned. The woman had enough fury in her to spit at Karn. The gob landed near his foot. They were so tiny. His strength, his reflexes, the facts of his body seemed an unfair advantage. Karn had torn through so many such creatures at Urza's request, walking through rank upon rank of soldiers like a lead weight through wet paper. He could almost feel it now: the resistance, then give, of those bodies; the heat of their blood trickling into his joints. The long hours he had spent while Urza slept cleaning his body with small wire brushes, scraping off the dried gore, digging out the clots from behind his knees. He had never felt clean enough.</p>

<p>"You are not Phyrexian," Karn said, "yet you are here, and if I am not mistaken, in service to them. What do you hope to accomplish?"</p>

<p>"You—you empty, fleshless husk. You desecrate our holy work with your touch." The female acolyte's rage dulled to a glittering self-satisfaction. "Others will respond to the barrier being broken. Gix's blessings upon them—they will come. They will come."</p>

<p>Ah, yes, the network of wires in the walls. When he had broken through them, he had likely triggered an alarm. Perhaps these first acolytes had responded as if some animal or natural event had severed the cables, but when these two did not report back, the others would not make such a mistake. Karn reached toward the female's face and, with a twist of his fingers, generated a metal gag. The only reason she hadn't shouted for help—sounds would carry in these caverns—was that it hadn't yet occurred to her.</p>

<p>She glared at him, making muffled noises that sounded like curses.</p>

<p>He leaned over the male acolyte. "What are you doing here?"</p>

<p>The male blinked at Karn. His pupils had dilated to different sizes. He was concussed. His speech, as a result, slurred. "Karn. I know you. It's good that you came."</p>

<p>Karn frowned.</p>

<p>"The Whispering One has a plan for you." The acolyte beamed. "She grows stronger daily, and you will serve her. Sheoldred welcomes you! It's your destiny, Karn, to create for us. To help us. To become one of us."</p>

<p>Karn generated another gag so that this one, when he regained his senses, could not call for help. The acolyte accepted the gag—almost as if he appreciated it—with a beatific smile.</p>

<p>Karn stepped away.</p>

<p>How had Sheoldred survived crossing between planes? A question he would ponder later: for now, he had to find her, to end the Phyrexian invasion before it started. And he could do that alone. Better that he did, for he could not be subverted. Venser's spark saved him from that.</p>

<p>Karn left the acolytes bound and gagged and plunged deeper into the cave network. The damp in these passages did not feel like the air around his camp but rather warm as breath. Hot moist air condensed on his cold body, trickling down in rivulets like sweat. Faint screams reverberated through the air.</p>

<p>The tunnel opened into a vast cavern, which echoed with the cacophony of human misery. On the other side of the crevasse was the Phyrexian staging ground, located on a broad flat area of the cavern floor. Antlike workers scrambled across the rope bridges strung over the crevasse, ferrying meaty gobs, bloody cables, and chunks of flesh over to humans being compleated on surgical tables. On the opposite wall of the cavern, a Phyrexian portal ship cut through the darkness like an immense scythe. Coils hung from this structure. The twitching loops' membranous purple gleam reminded Karn of intestines.</p>

<p>Sheoldred hung suspended in this morass. She was still. Tubes fed reddish and milky substances into her black segmented body. The mandibles that extended down from her thorax lay open, relaxed. Her humanoid torso, welded to the thorax's top, lay nested in a thick network of writhing inky lines. A horned mask obscured her face. Beneath her, worshippers clung together and raised their voices in an ecstatic paean.</p>

</div>

<p>The defunct Phyrexian portal ship and Sheoldred's sleeping form dominated the cavern. Acolytes in the gray robes of the Society of Mishra attended surgical machines that converted struggling people into Phyrexian abominations. Compleated monstrosities dotted the cavern's floor like grotesque artworks, skittering on too many limbs. More acolytes stacked weapons beside a Phyrexian skyship. Teams of splicers scaled a dragon engine to repair it, so small that their welding torches seemed like white stars against the engine's metal skeleton.</p>

<p>He'd found the staging ground of the Phyrexian invasion.</p>

<p>A single figure attended Sheoldred: a young woman with platinum-brown skin and dark umber curls who wore the cloak of the Tolarian academy. When she turned, Karn saw the red dot from a mechanical eye. Below, an acolyte hurried forward and offered up gobbets of flesh. The young woman sorted through them, twisting some into the morass that supported Sheoldred. Karn traced the line of acolytes carrying materials from the immense monstrosity to Sheoldred and her helper. She was <em>mining</em> the monstrosity to repair Sheoldred's damaged biological components.</p>

<p>If the other Planeswalkers could see this now, they'd know that Karn's fears were true. Jhoira would say—</p>

<p>No. It didn't matter what Jhoira would say. Karn faced this threat alone. He needed to alert the others, yes, but neither could he leave this staging ground intact. He had to destroy the Phyrexians before they could defend themselves.</p>

<p>His course of action decided, Karn held out his hand, palm up. He raised his other hand above it. He visualized the incendiary device he planned to generate from the inside out. He could see its every component, its chemicals, laid out like a dimensional blueprint. His fingertips buzzed with the magic of his creation. The layers of material accumulated in midair. It was no sylex, but it would end Sheoldred.</p>

<p>A klaxon filled the cavern with its high-pitched holler.</p>

<p>Karn located its source as acolytes, worshippers, and Phyrexian agents paused in their work: the female acolyte who'd attacked him was blowing a horn. Either she'd been discovered and freed, or she'd freed herself: the drawback to leaving his attackers alive.</p>

<p>The shrill sound prompted action. Acolytes loaded weapons into the skyships. Phyrexian surgeons loaded their bloodied operating tables into skyships. Others boarded the skyships, evacuating. Compleated Phyrexian monstrosities shuddered to life, metal fibers snaking out from their bodies. Others slumped to the floor. Claw-like limbs exploded from their abdomens and their gaping mouths opened blindly, like reptiles scenting for prey.</p>

<p>A red beam dotted Karn's chest.</p>

<p>Karn dropped flat to the rock just as a bolt of electricity flew overhead. He pressed his palms to the ground, lifting himself high enough to crawl forward. At the cliff's edge, he peered to the cavern's floor, trying to locate the blast's origin.</p>

<p>The Tolarian who aided Sheoldred leveled a glaive at him. She had replaced her eye with a miniaturized ray cannon, and its red beam hit Karn. Karn rolled to the side. A crackle exploded the rock beside him. Smoke wisped up from where he'd once lain.</p>

</div>

<p>Compleated Phyrexians swarmed toward him, and the Tolarian smiled. She placed a hand on Sheoldred's limp claw. Sheoldred remained limp, inert—as if she were under sedation while the young woman worked to restore her—and vulnerable.</p>

<p>And Karn still held his incendiary device.</p>

<p>The nearest bridge over to Sheoldred was close but narrow. Twelve ecstatic worshippers and the young woman with the glaive blocked his access to the Praetor. But Sheoldred seemed some distance from the Phyrexians and Tolarian acolytes located on the cavern floor. If Karn was quick, he would not have to battle through all Sheoldred's followers to attack her: just the twelve worshippers, the Tolarian making it thirteen.</p>

<p>Karn pushed himself to his feet and charged down the narrow stone bridge. Sheoldred's worshippers ceased their paean and launched themselves toward him. Two reached the bridge. Karn shouldered them aside into crevasse's abyss.</p>

<p>The other worshippers crowded themselves into a blockade. Two had leveled spears at him, which would have kept him at bay had he been a creature with flesh. Puncturing weapons annoyed him only if the shafts or blades became trapped in his joints and inhibited his range of motion. Similarly, the two young men with rotating saws did not give him pause: those blades would glance from his body. No, Karn focused on the worshippers who wielded the pistol chisels and welding torches.</p>

<p>It all came back to him so easily. He felt numb, efficient. As Urza made him. Karn stopped an inch away from the spearpoints. The worshippers shifted, uneasy. Karn took one step forward, seized a spear, and lifted. A worshipper, still clinging to his weapon, gaped and dangled. Karn swung him into foes, sweeping several off the bridge and breaking up their blockade. Then he tossed the spear-wielder into the crevasse's depths, the man's screams fading as he fell.</p>

<p>The other spear-wielder, an older woman, jammed her spearpoint into a gap in his torso. Although he held an incendiary device, he cracked the spear shaft by hammering his fist down, breaking it off inside himself. He'd deal with that later. He grabbed the broken shaft end, which she still held, and used it to swing her aside. She fell and crumpled.</p>

<p>Only six combatants remained.</p>

<p>The wielder of a rotating saw swung their buzzing instrument at Karn's head. Karn stepped back to evade. Before the saw could come around again, he stepped within the wielder's range and removed the tool from the man's fingers. The man tried to resist, but Karn had overwhelming strength on his side. Prying away the man's grip was disturbingly easy. Karn lifted him and tossed him into two more worshippers. The force crunched all three to the floor in a sickening confusion of broken limbs.</p>

<p>A piston chisel wielder rushed him from the side. The chisel thunked into Karn, then skidded down his arm, throwing its user off balance. Karn punched him. The man went flying. The remaining two worshippers fled; their faith was not so great in the face of such bodily harm. All these humans, even with the Phyrexian alterations, were no sturdier to him than butterflies. Karn wished it were not so easy.</p>

<p>He strode to Sheoldred. She hung, limp within her cradle but no longer quiescent. Her segmented limbs twitched like an arachnid's as she emerged into consciousness. Her human torso atop her thorax shivered. Her long fingers reached downward to the young woman in the Tolarian robes. But she did not seem aware—not yet.</p>

<p>"Karn." The Tolarian spoke with contempt. "I've heard a lot about you."</p>

<p>"How so?"</p>

<p>Her gaze flicked to Sheoldred's inert form, then returned to him. "You aren't as impressive as I've been led to believe."</p>

<p>Karn walked toward Sheoldred, the incendiary device in his hand.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" Karn asked the Tolarian. "Why would you bring this here?"</p>

<p>"Rona. And this," she gestured to Sheoldred, "is Dominaria's salvation."</p>

<p>Rona positioned herself between Karn and Sheoldred, glaive held easy and at an angle in her palms. Rona's flesh eye narrowed while her mechanical socket focused its laser onto Karn's torso. She flexed her hands around her glaive. Its blade brightened, crackling with blue electricity. She smiled.</p>

<p>"I do not wish to fight you," Karn told her.</p>

<p>"Too bad."</p>

<p>Rona leveled her glaive at him, and electricity burst from her blade.</p>

<p>The electricity danced across his body, sparking. Karn grimaced at the pain but pushed through it, walking toward her as more waves rippled from its blade, pouring over him. Karn paused, dazed, and tried to shake off the agony as Rona continued to attack. She swung the glaive down, lodging it into his shoulder. Karn twisted, pulling it from her grip, and removed it from his body. He threw it aside. While he was occupied, Rona unsheathed a dagger and jammed it into one of his abdominal seams. She dug it between the plates that allowed him to flex, as if searching for organs. Karn winced.</p>

<p>Karn gripped her head in one of his hands. He pressed his thumb into the mechanical eye and shattered the ray's lens. Rona shrieked and kicked. Karn tossed her into the wall. Bones crunched. She slammed into it, then fell to the ground. She curled, her hands around her head, her leg at an angle unnatural to human beings. Oil and blood oozed from the broken mechanical parts in her eye socket. She glared up at him from between her fingers, her lips drawn into a rictus.</p>

<p>"Why don't you kill me?" Rona taunted him. "Finish me off."</p>

<p>"I am not a weapon."</p>

<p>Karn neared Sheoldred, holding his incendiary device. Although her humanoid part was the size of an ordinary woman, she attached to a scorpion-like body easily three times his size. In contrast to that well-crafted beauty, the organic materials grafted into her human torso seemed crude, bloody. Rona had tried her best to replace the organic parts that had burned away in the Blind Eternities during Sheoldred's transit between planes, but its patchwork nature showed.</p>

<p>He would tear her to pieces. He would crush her while she was still weak. He would do anything—<em>anything</em>—to stop Sheoldred from Phyrexianizing this plane. Karn reached up and seized Sheoldred's torso, determined to finish this. He would tuck this device between the vulnerable plates of her body and destroy her.</p>

<p>At his touch, Sheoldred stirred. Her helmeted head craned down toward him. He could <em>feel</em> her with the same senses he used to determine the elemental composition of a compound. Her inorganic components stretched out before him like the pages in a book. Her biological parts lay like dark tumors nested within the metal's luminescent glory. He could read her thoughts—some of them.</p>

<p><em>Welcome, Father</em>, Sheoldred whispered into his mind, one mechanical being to another. <em>What plans I have for you.</em></p>

<p>Karn recoiled from her slimy whisper, stepping back. And he knew what she had done.</p>

<p>Phyrexian sleeper agents lurked in every land in Dominaria, these unknowing spies peppered throughout every government, throughout the military, throughout common people. He saw a brewer dumping hops into a vat. A spy. He saw a scribe sitting at a desk, her hand poised over a letter. He saw an adolescent playing chase with his cousins, pretending to be a monster when he was one, Phyrexian armature ready to explode from his back. Phyrexian agents were people's lovers, comrades, colleagues at work. They were everywhere. They could be anyone.</p>

<p><em>Welcome</em>, her whisper echoed within him. <em>Welcome.</em></p>

<p>Karn reached between the plates on her thorax and deposited the incendiary device inside her body. He lifted his thumb to flip the switch that would allow the two chemicals within it to flow into each other and combust.</p>

<p>But his hand did not move. His joints had locked. He attempted to look down to examine himself, but even his neck remained rigid. He tried to turn and couldn't move his arms, legs, or torso. He couldn't tell whether he'd been paralyzed or locked into place.</p>

<p>In his peripheral vision he could see Rona dragging herself—shattered lens, broken leg and all—toward unfamiliar magical devices, ones that she must have created herself. She left a trail of oil, blood, and fluorescent blue fluid behind her.</p>

<p>Karn strained against the strange magic that gripped him.</p>

<p>Rona levered herself up into a seated position. From her grunts, it sounded agonizing.</p>

<p>"Your mistake," she said, "was not killing me when you had the chance. We have expected your coming, Karn. We have prepared."</p>

<p>He tried again to move, his internal mechanisms groaning with the effort, and felt his metal torque. He would bend—break—before he freed himself from Rona's magic through force.</p>

<p>Rona sorted through the heaped parts she'd been using to repair Sheoldred. She lifted up a node, smiled, and set it aside. With a grimace, she dug her fingers into her damaged eye socket and yanked out the ruined node, exposing raw tissue and a piece of gleaming skull near her eyebrow. A gout of clear liquid spurted out. She clicked the new node into place.</p>

<p>Roars boomed through the cavern. Rock sifted down, pinging against Karn's body.</p>

<p>"That," Rona said, "was the sound of our ships evacuating our forces from this staging area—which has been compromised—and retreating to a secondary staging area. We have many bases across Dominaria. You will not find them all."</p>

<p>Rona drove her glaive into her leg. She grunted, slicing through her clothing and her flesh. Her eyes teared—even the eye she'd replaced dripped. Panting, she bared her muscle and her broken bone to the cavern's air.</p>

<p>Karn had failed. Held with Rona's magic, he would be unable to warn his friends, unable to fight at their sides, unable to save them when the compleated Phyrexian agents exploded from their dearest companions to kill them.</p>

<p>The cavern had emptied and quieted enough that Karn could hear the click as Rona slid a device into her leg. She sighed and folded her flesh over the metal. She fixed another panel over her thigh, sealing her wound shut, and then stood. She rolled her shoulders and smiled.</p>

<p>"Sheoldred, in her beauty, my Whispering One," Rona said, "grows stronger by the day, and she will lead us to victory."</p>

<p>Karn, still arm-deep in Sheoldred's torso, could feel clicking vibrate along his body. Sheoldred split apart, dividing herself up in pieces. Her segments broke away, each piece sprouting a dozen viridian segmented legs. The swarm poured over Karn, using him as a bridge to the floor. The spider-like creatures ran along Karn's arms, down his back and torso, the backs of his knees, his calves. The <em>tink-tink-tink</em> of their metallic claws reverberated through him. A tarantula-sized piece sprang free from the cables onto Karn's face. It clung to his head, twitching, a heart-like nugget of flesh grafted into the center of its modified thorax. It crawled over his head. He could feel its wet body slither down his back. It dropped to the floor and scampered away.</p>

<p>"I may not be able to stop you, Urza's creation," Rona said, "but I can prevent you from stopping us."</p>

<p>From the edge of his vision, Karn could see Rona limp down a tunnel. Even with her makeshift repairs, Rona remained heavily damaged, and she leaned on her glaive, using it as a cane. Her leg spurted yellow fluid, and she staggered. She paused to catch her breath. Oil dribbled from her new inserts, mingled with blood.</p>

<p>He turned his head to watch her. The field paralyzing Karn had weakened. Perhaps it was due to Rona's retreat. Did she carry the device with her that held him in place? Karn attempted to raise his arm. The effort shuddered through him. He lifted one finger.</p>

<p>Rona let her shoulder rest against the tunnel wall. She used her glaive to cut free a strip of cloth from her mantle. "I hope that as we take this plane, as we make it more perfect, you feel the keenness of failure once again."</p>

<p>Karn strained against the force gripping him. His jaw ached. "What<nbsp> . . .</nbsp>"</p>

<p>Rona bound the cloth strip around her leaking leg in a tourniquet. "As you watch the people you've known for eons transform and turn against you, I hope it hurts."</p>

<p>"Why would you say that?" Karn managed. He had to keep her talking. If he could break free<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> "What ­have I done to you that you would wish such horror upon me?"</p>

<p>"When the Mirrans became Phyrexian," Rona said, "it was the best thing that ever happened to them. They were independent from their creator. Unified. Beautiful."</p>

<p>The force holding Karn seemed to loosen. He needed to push free. Even with the Phyrexian staging ground in the Caves of Koilos empty, if Karn could capture Rona, as Sheoldred's right hand she would be able to provide valuable information. All was not yet lost.</p>

<p>"You'd kill them, wouldn't you," Rona said, "for reaching for perfection."</p>

<p>He only needed one more moment—</p>

<p>"You gave Memnarch your intelligence. Your capabilities. But he didn't have the experience to deal with it. The guidance. He was so lost." Rona's smile twisted. She enjoyed his struggle. "I can't stand bad parents."</p>

<p>Karn stopped. His body couldn't have reverberated more if she had struck him.</p>

<p>Rona flipped a switch on the wall. There was a small grating noise. Then, a series of booms overhead. The roar, as the cavern fell, engulfed him. Tons of rock poured onto him. A boulder rolled off the cavern's wall, then bounced into his chest. It tossed him onto his back. He stared up at the collapsing cavern, still paralyzed by Rona's device. Rocks sheeted down. Fist-sized pieces hammered into his body. Smaller pebbles thunked and plinked against him, rolling and filling in the gaps. His vision turned gray from dust then blackened out as the stone obscured all light. The rock weighed upon him.</p>

<p>He could feel Rona's spell ease. He could move—or at least beneath all this stone, he could attempt to move, to twitch a finger. For whatever good it did him. Not even he could lift this stone. Not even he could dig his way out from this cave-in.</p>

<p>The crushing layer of rock was too heavy even for him to shift.</p>

<p>Karn reached for the spark that allowed him to planeswalk. It burned within him, hot and bright, such a perpetual companion that he had ceased to notice it. If he could just focus and—</p>

<p>It didn't work. Nothing happened.</p>

<p>Karn reached out with his special senses through his fingertips and analyzed the surrounding inorganic materials: olivine, granite, quartz, mica. Ordinary stone, but with all the ancient interplanar and Phyrexian technology providing a low-grade interference, he could not planeswalk away.</p>

<p>He was trapped. Only he knew that Sheoldred had come to Dominaria, and he could warn no one.</p>

<p>— Eladamri, Lord of Leaves</p>
<p>Teferi never thought he'd walk any halls erected by Urza again, let alone ones his former mentor strode through as a mortal man. Four thousand years was a long time for any edifice to remain standing, let alone one so integral to a continent-destroying war. But there Teferi was all the same, climbing the spiraling steps of the tower where, millennia before, Urza engineered mechanical constructs to fight a bitter struggle against his brother, Mishra.</p>
<p>The tower itself was in pristine shape, if desolate. Stone and metal were meticulously fitted together with no seams or cracks, as if the tower had been willed into existence rather than put together by hands. Legend had it that Urza built this tower to be his personal workshop away from the horrors of the Brothers' War, and it showed in the care he'd poured to its golden accents, its orniary, its assembly armatures—the kind of care he'd never been able to extend to the people in his life.</p>
<p>The mystery of the tower was how it had evaded ransacking through the centuries. There had been no signs of raiders establishing camps, no evidence of opportunistic wizards setting up their laboratories. Structurally, it would have been perfect for either. Teferi could have been convinced that it was the tower's well-concealed location in a mist-shrouded vale that ensured the tower's survival. But he knew better. It was dumb luck—the same luck that all of Urza's machinations seemed to rely on (and succeed with). Reckless luck. Dangerous luck. The kind that promised only the extremes of success or failure with pain attached to each.</p>
<p>Teferi reached the top of the stairs, where he paused to catch his breath and clutch his midsection, the wounds he'd received in New Argive still sore. Yes, he could have used his magic to levitate up, but Subira had always impressed upon him the serenity that came with the meditation of one step<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> after one step<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> after one. How he wished Subira were there to cut through his tightly wound knot of concerns.</p>
<p><em>Get out of your head</em>, she would always tell him. <em>Look with your eyes.</em></p>
<p>Entering his quarters, Teferi noted the new, if sparse, furnishings of a table, chair, and cot that had been added in the week or so since he was gone planeswalking across the Multiverse. Then he ventured out onto the mist-shrouded battlement high above the secluded vale. Breathing in the cold Argivian air, he gazed over the edge and imagined phalanxes of metal warriors lined up underneath this very battlement, their thunderous heels pounding the ground.</p>
<p>Teferi turned away from the battlement to see a squat construct resembling an upright brass caterpillar waddle through the door, tenuously balancing a cup filled with a steaming, green-hued liquid and small plate of tea biscuits. Teferi could only watch confused as the poor thing made its way across the room. He assumed that the construct was Saheeli's work, but he wasn't sure how to react to it.</p>
<p>"This can't be for me," he said, hoping that it understood him. "I just arrived."</p>
<p>"That's my doing." Standing in the doorway was Jodah, as handsome and vibrant as ever. No matter how miserable the occasion, he always managed to look every bit the part of Dominaria's most acclaimed archmage. His robes were spotless, and his smile shone as bright as the Null Moon on a clear night. "I cast an intruder alarm on the tower, so I knew you were back. I hope you don't mind me taking liberties with your breakfast."</p>
<p>"No. You're very kind," said Teferi, biting into one of the tea biscuits. Hmm. What was that strange flavor? Not sweet, but salty, with an odd tang and a sand-like grit between his teeth. "What is this?"</p>
<p>"That is the traditional biscuit of the Kjeldoran people," Jodah said. "I gave my recipe to Saheeli, and she whipped up one of her constructs to bake them. She's quite brilliant." He narrowed his eyes. "Why do you ask?"</p>
<p>"Is it supposed to taste like that?"</p>
<p>Jodah picked up a biscuit and scrutinized it. "I've eaten thousands of these, so I don't see what could be wrong." Then he took a bite. "Huh. You're right. It's a bit off. Maybe the roach flour's gone stale."</p>
<p>"Roach flour," Teferi repeated, glaring at Jodah.</p>
<p>"Mmm-hmm," said Jodah, popping the rest of the biscuit into his mouth.</p>
<p>Teferi gingerly dropped his onto the plate. "How are things holding up here?"</p>
<p>"As well as can be expected. You'll have to ask Saheeli how she's faring on her project, but I can tell you that we have our privacy. For now, at least."</p>
<p>That was good to hear. A handful of weeks had passed since the attack on the Mana Rig, leaving Teferi with few allies and fewer resources. Karn had been taken by the Phyrexians, the sylex destroyed, and Ajani revealed to be a sleeper agent. To thwart any more prying eyes, Jodah insisted on finding a new base, a sentiment Teferi agreed with. What he didn't necessarily agree with was relocating to Urza's Tower. But what was done was done.</p>
<p>"I brought Wrenn," said Teferi. "Did you happen to see her?"</p>
<p>"Yes. We met on my way up here. Not exactly the friendliest sort."</p>
<p>"Let her warm up to you. You'll find her wisdom without peer."</p>
<p>"Speaking of peers, two more Planeswalkers arrived soon after you did."</p>
<p>Teferi raised an eyebrow. For the last month, he'd been feverishly chasing down allies throughout the Multiverse, but most of the long-standing Planeswalker contacts he managed to find laughed at his entreaties. Teferi had more luck with the younger Planeswalkers who'd fought alongside him against Nicol Bolas: Saheeli Rai was the most vital recruit due to her skill with artifacts. Kaya was instrumental for her keen strategic mind and her network of informants across distant planes. And Wrenn he'd sought out for her ability to see through his own foolish affectations. He had not expected anyone to come looking for him.</p>
<p>"Kaya seemed to know them," said Jodah, shrugging his shoulders. "That and the fact that this place hasn't exploded yet means that they're probably friendly."</p>
<p>"I guess we should see what they want." Teferi took a sip of tea. The hints of lemon and honey tempered his anxiety, allowing him to address something he'd been dreading since they'd left Shiv. "Before we go, I wanted to ask a favor."</p>
<p>"This sounds ominous."</p>
<p>"Once Saheeli's time machine is ready, I'll be indisposed," Teferi explained. "I'll need—all of us will need—someone to lead and make the right decisions." He placed a hand on Jodah's shoulder. "I'd like you to consider being that person."</p>
<p>"Consider?" Jodah asked with a grin. "You're not just going to order me to do it?"</p>
<p>Teferi shook his head. "I've learned that it's better to ask."</p>
<p>"Only took you sixty years." Jodah placed his hand on Teferi's. "I'll try not to burn the place down."</p>
<hr />
<p>"Where is Ajani?"</p>
<p>The expression on Elspeth Tirel's face when Teferi answered was one he'd seen before. It was at Tolarian Academy, on a visit to Barrin, his old headmaster—not so much a visit as an act of contrition. Teferi remembered the venerable mage standing up from his desk, his face sunken, jaw quivering, the tempest inside stayed only by propriety. The name dividing them was <em>Rayne</em>—Barrin's dead wife, killed in a war Teferi spearheaded, a war he bore responsibility for.</p>
<p>The name was different this day—Ajani's instead of Rayne's. But that exact same look that Barrin had worn<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> It cut into Teferi like an old, rusty dagger in Elspeth's calloused grip.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry," Teferi repeated, but the words felt hollow. "I wish things were different—"</p>
<p>Before he could say anything more, Elspeth raised her hand to stop him. She crossed her arms and stepped into the far corner of the room, her back toward everyone else. Teferi began to follow, but Jodah seized his arm, keeping him in place.</p>
<p>"Let her be," he said, then to Kaya: "Go ahead."</p>
<p>Everyone who had gathered in Kaya's makeshift war room, save Elspeth, huddled around a glowing sphere of ghostly light that hovered over a pool in the room's center. At the head of the crowd was the other freshly arrived Planeswalker, Vivien Reid, who Teferi had met on Ravnica during their struggle against Nicol Bolas.</p>
<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align:right;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/7h4nywndey.jpg" /><p class="embedImageCaption">Art by: <a href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&amp;output=spoiler&amp;method=visual&amp;artist=+[%22Peter%20Polach%22]" target="_blank">Peter Polach</a></p></div></div>
<p>"The New Coalition continues to marshal defenses against further attacks on Dominaria," Kaya explained. "But the Phyrexians are relentless, as we found out on Shiv."</p>
<p>Teferi could barely pay attention. His eye strayed again and again to Elspeth alone in the corner. Karn had told him tales of her courage in saving him from the Phyrexians. And then there was Ajani pulling him aside to excitedly tell him how he'd found Elspeth alive, despite her seeming demise on Theros. <em>The champion we need</em>, Ajani had said. <em>One that we can trust.</em></p>
<p>Was Ajani still himself then? Could Elspeth be trusted?</p>
<p>"Kaldheim and Ixalan are mobilized," Kaya said, walking around the sphere to highlight key points and locations in the Gatewatch's plan. "Jace is on Ravnica lobbying for support from the guilds, while Chandra has gone to Zendikar to contact Nissa. When we've finished our tasks here, Saheeli intends to spearhead the defense of Kaladesh." Kaya stopped at one last point on the sphere. "Then we have the Mirran camp on New Phyrexia itself, led by Koth."</p>
<p>Elspeth turned, her eyes lit. "Koth is alive. How did you find this out?"</p>
<p>"Jace," Kaya said. "I don't know his source, but he told me that Koth and the Mirrans are planning an assault on the Phyrexian core. We plan on joining them once we're ready. Then together, we'll eliminate the Phyrexian leadership and mop up what's left. Without a head, the body will fail."</p>
<p>"That's a death sentence," Elspeth said. "Koth knows that better than anyone."</p>
<p>Teferi began to explain. "If you'll just listen to our plan—"</p>
<p>"No. You listen to me. Koth and I once tried to do exactly what you're proposing, and it ended in failure." Her eyes darted from person to person before finally settling on Teferi. That look. "None of you were there." With that, she stormed out of the room.</p>
<p>The quiet afterward was unsettling. Teferi knew that no matter what strategy they used, the odds would not favor any outside force trying to penetrate New Phyrexia's defenses. Everyone else in the room understood that, too. But hearing it said out loud in as direct a fashion as Elspeth had done crystallized how dire the stakes really were.</p>
<p>"Let me talk to her," Jodah said, a hand on Teferi's back. "The responsibilities of leadership, eh?" He walked out the door to track Elspeth down.</p>
<p>Vivien extended her hand to Teferi, greeting him with the grip of a seasoned hunter. "Good to see you again Teferi, though under circumstances just as unfortunate as last time."</p>
<p>"You and Elspeth are welcome to stay and rest if you need it."</p>
<p>Vivien shook her head. "I'm going to Ravnica to make sure Jace is apprised of the situation. Then I'll head to Ikoria. I'm worried about being able to organize a meaningful defense there. All the settlements do is squabble, so I'm going to make sure they stay in line."</p>
<p>"And Elspeth?"</p>
<p>"With this news of Ajani," said Vivien, "I think it would do her good to be among friends."</p>
<p>"<em>If </em>she considers us friends."</p>
<p>"She's been through much. Give her time."</p>
<p><em>Time.</em> A luxury Teferi knew they had precious little of.</p>
<p>"As for the task at hand, that's why we're here," she said. "I have intelligence from a Phyrexian insider—Urabrask, the praetor of the Quiet Furnace. Kaya's information seems to align with what we've been told, but it is incomplete."</p>
<p>Teferi felt the frown lines on his face deepen. The Phyrexians he'd been familiar with were militaristic fanatics who did not tolerate dissent. The notion of these New Phyrexians having factions among them seemed anathema to their very nature.</p>
<p>"What did Urabrask say?"</p>
<p>"That Elesh Norn, a rival praetor, has nearly unified New Phyrexia under her banner," said Vivien. "Urabrask and his forces stand opposed to Norn's aspirations. He's planning his own revolution and is communicating with the Mirrans."</p>
<p>"Whatever the case, we'll be on the ground there soon," Teferi insisted.</p>
<p>"Not soon enough," said Vivien. "Urabrask didn't give specifics, but he was concerned about some way that Elesh Norn may have to force her 'one singularity' throughout New Phyrexia and, more importantly, the Multiverse. She plans to expand her dominion all at once."</p>
<p>"Gods and monsters," Kaya whispered.</p>
<p>"What is it?" asked Teferi.</p>
<p>"The creature I told you about—the one I was hired to kill," she said as she began pacing the room. "I'd never encountered anything like it—a beast of stitched flesh over metal. After you and I talked, we both agreed it was a Phyrexian. But I couldn't figure out why, of all places, it was on Kaldheim. With Vivien's information<nbsp> . . .</nbsp>" Kaya activated the expression pool, shaping it with the force of her mind. The result was a three-dimensional rendering of a many-limbed tree, crowned at the top like the great magnigoths populating the woodlands of Yavimaya, only constantly undulating as if made from the effluvia of the Multiverse itself. "This is the World Tree of Kaldheim. It's like a network that allows instantaneous travel between all the realms of the plane. What if<nbsp> . . .</nbsp>"</p>
<p>Kaya didn't have to finish. If the Phyrexians had somehow replicated or repurposed Kaldheim's World Tree, it could conceivably join every plane in the Multiverse. With it in place, the Phyrexians could be anywhere, at any time, at the speed of thought. They didn't just have to worry about secret infiltrations like on Dominaria; the Phyrexians could march their armies in directly.</p>
<p>"By now, whatever Urabrask has planned is only days away from happening. If we're going to make a move, it must happen very soon."</p>
<p>"Days?" said Teferi. He didn't think he had such a small window to work with.</p>
<p>"I don't like it," said Kaya. "The timing of this proposed alliance is too perfect."</p>
<p>At a gut level, Teferi agreed. He'd played this game before and learned that the enemy of my enemy could be the <em>worser</em> enemy by far. All it took to fall into the trap was a tasty scrap, an irresistible temptation. The truth was the choicest morsel of all to snatch a victim.</p>
<p>"I have my suspicions as well," Vivien said. "But I don't believe we have many alternatives other than taking Urabrask at his word. I'll vouch for him and for the intermediary who arranged for my audience with him."</p>
<p>"And who is that?" asked Teferi.</p>
<p>"Tezzeret."</p>
<p>"No," Kaya declared. "No way. You know what he did on Ravnica! And he still has access to the Planar Bridge!" She turned to Teferi. "If we trust Tezzeret, we could fall straight into the Phyrexians' trap. Again."</p>
<p>Once more, Kaya spoke the truth. And yet, how foolish would it be to cast aside a possible advantage over their opponents? A revolution from within could split the battlefield and nullify the upper hand the Phyrexians had on their home plane.</p>
<p>"See what you can learn through your contacts," Teferi said to Kaya. "Right now, we have to concentrate on what we're doing here."</p>
<p>Kaya stood down. "Fine. I'll shake the money tree on Ravnica. We'll see what gets knocked loose."</p>
<p>"I wish you both luck," said Vivien, turning to leave. "For all our sakes."</p>
<hr />
<p>If any part of Urza's Tower still bore the marks of its creator, it was the eastern wing. At the height of the Brothers' War, witnessing the machine arms assemble one of Urza's constructs would have seemed like a miracle to the Korlisians or Argivians who'd only waged war with pike, sword, and blood.</p>
<p>Now those machine arms lay in heaps on the floor, joining the spare parts and scrap Urza left behind when he abandoned his tower for Argoth. And amid this heap sat Saheeli Rai cross legged on the floor. Saheeli had been one of Teferi's first recruits. Like Vivien and Kaya, he'd first met her on Ravnica, but she was a far cry from their forbidding dispositions. Saheeli instead embraced the visceral joy in seeking the art in artifice, as exemplified by the beautiful spun-gold peafowl that hopped up high and glided back down to the floor.</p>
<p>"Hello!" greeted Saheeli, enjoying a small cup of tea to go along with more of those biscuits Jodah had served to him earlier. She slid over and patted the floor next to her. "Care to join me?"</p>
<p>"No thank you," he said. "I wanted to quickly check in. How are things going?"</p>
<p>"They are<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> going."</p>
<p>Teferi looked around at the circle of workbenches Saheeli had pulled up upon the main assembly platform, her own private little workspace in the middle of the wreck that used to be Urza's grand showroom. Atop one of those tables was an item that caught his eye—an exquisite piece of art, a bowl made of copper pulled, twisted, and shaped like no human hands ever could. But it was so much more than that.</p>
<p>"You did it," Teferi said as he approached the bowl. "It's perfect."</p>
<p>"I wouldn't use that word," said Saheeli.</p>
<p>But Teferi wanted to. Saheeli had crafted a perfect replica of the sylex: a blend of the signature elements of the original relic with subtle nods to Saheeli's characteristic filigree stylings. Her version featured the same heavy handles on both sides, the same shallow bas-relief depictions of farmers armed with scythes facing down a troop of armored knights. Identical runes—a master translation between several ancient languages—spiraled downward from the inner edges of the bowl to the very bottom.</p>
<p>"It's one thing to create something you've seen and held before," she said. "It's another to do so from notes that may not be complete."</p>
<p>"I trust you did your best."</p>
<p>"I hope my best is good enough."</p>
<p>"How is the new time machine?" he said, moving onto the other major goal he'd assigned to her.</p>
<p>"Temporal Anchor," Saheeli reminded him. "Things are progressing, as you can see." She motioned to the other side of the platform, where her machine sat. Teferi still remembered Urza's time machine—an eyesore of glass cylinders and snaking tubes that took up half a classroom in Tolarian Academy. Saheeli's, in contrast, was a sculpture of swooping curves made of fiery orange metal. It, like the sylex, would have fit into any gallery of fine art.</p>
<p>"You're too modest. It's far less painful-looking than your initial version."</p>
<p>"I'll accept that compliment," Saheeli said with a laugh. "Still, there have been a few snags. Aether is a much easier energy source to manipulate; even the most powerful aether engine is like a candle flame to a supernova when it comes to this."</p>
<p>She placed her hand on the pedestal where the <em>Weatherlight</em>'s powerstone sat enmeshed in a nest of copper coils. Teferi grimaced. The mere memory of seeing the mighty airship, a symbol of strength for all Dominaria, twisted into a Phyrexian abomination soured his stomach.</p>
<p>"Managing the power load while trying to ensure the safety of the occupant is difficult," Saheeli said. "These components were never meant to work together." The mildest of accusations hung in the air between them. Teferi knew he'd saddled Saheeli with a nigh-impossible task and very little margin for error. "I think I've figured it out, but I need to run more tests."</p>
<p>He measured his words. "It's not my intention to push too hard, but—"</p>
<p>"I know," said Saheeli. "Here." Placing her hand onto the floor, Saheeli allowed the wind-up bird to alight onto her finger. "I made it for you."</p>
<p>"For me?"</p>
<p>With a smile, she flicked her hand, and the peafowl hopped onto Teferi's foot and pecked at his boot. "In Ghirapur, birds like this perch on the bridges that cross Canal Dukhara. Those bridges represent the founding of the city, when warring nobles decided it would be better to cooperate and create a future not dominated by war. For us, this little bird represents our cooperation, our unity in purpose."</p>
<p>Teferi bent down and let the bird hop onto his palm. He stood up, holding the bird close to his face. Its movements captured the herky-jerky nature of a flesh and blood bird, so much so that a casual observer might have mistaken it for its organic counterpart. But on closer inspection, one could discern between its golden feathers a clockwork heart that pulsed with the unmistakable glow of a tiny powerstone—one of dozens scavenged from the fallen Mana Rig. The bird hopped once to face him straight on, then unfurled its feathers in an arc of such delicate craftsmanship that Urza couldn't have matched in a thousand millennia, let alone a handful of days. Teferi chuckled.</p>
<p>"You like it?" Saheeli asked.</p>
<p>"Very much," he said. "My mentor was a great artificer, perhaps the best this plane has ever had. And the notion of prizing style over function would send him into fits. 'Bah! A waste of resources!' he'd say."</p>
<p>"Chance has granted us gifts," said Saheeli. "How we use our gifts will ultimately define us. I choose beauty. That is how I would like to be known." She whistled, and in response, the artifact bird spread its wings and spun in place, spraying a shower of multicolored sparks in every direction. Teferi couldn't help but smile. After a minute, the bird was back to its normal self, pecking at invisible crumbs he didn't have in his hand. "The Anchor will be ready to use tonight. Come back then."</p>
<hr />
<p>Teferi rested against one of the few trees that still grew within the tower's narrow greenbelt ring. Before he lost his spark to the time rifts, he couldn't conceive of his body ever experiencing the aches and pains of age. <em>That's for others</em>, he'd thought. <em>Not me. Not ever.</em> It turned out that it was exactly for him, exactly what he'd needed, even with his spark restored. He found ironic amusement in it: the plane's foremost temporal mage succumbing to the ravages of time, welcoming them, even.</p>
<p>The sun had crested hours before, not that the high peaks surrounding the vale allowed for much direct sunlight outside a short window of time in the middle of the day. He thought of all the lands past the horizon. Shiv, where Jhoira was rallying dragons, viashino, goblins, and her own Ghitu to protect their land from Phyrexian attack. Orvada, where the merchant-lords had agreed to put aside their bristly relationship with Benalia and furnish food and supplies to Serran troops led by Lyra Dawnbringer. Urborg, where rumors had arisen of a spectral panther warrior back from the dead to bring salvation to the living. Outside this vale, Dominaria was uniting like it never had. But would any of that matter if he and his companions failed in their mission?</p>
<p>From behind him, Teferi heard heavy footsteps approach, accompanied by the brush of leaves against the wind, the creak of bark and xylem bending under stress. He looked up to see Wrenn and Seven approaching. It had taken Teferi some time to track Wrenn down, locating her finally on the plane of Cridhe, where she and Seven were basking in the intense mana showers of the plane's Clan Tree. It had taken him even more time to convince her to leave with him.</p>
<p>"I have fulfilled your request," said Wrenn. "They will grow strong, though your choice of land is questionable. There are no songs here, no harmony. Only isolated chords, warped and fragmented. Or worse—severed like gangrenous limbs."</p>
<p>"I promised you more. I'm sorry."</p>
<p>"Do not be. We are glad you have brought us here. I have been loath to explain to Seven about malevolence, about destruction. Better to show. Better to feel." Seven stooped to let Wrenn reach out and touch his hand. "Your own song is discordant this day, a vexing melody."</p>
<p>Teferi nodded. "I've been thinking."</p>
<p>"That is not reassuring, mage."</p>
<p>This amused Teferi, albeit fleetingly. "I was thinking about you, Kaya, and Saheeli—all of you who answered my call for help." He set Saheeli's clockwork peafowl onto the stone ground in front of him. It pecked about nonchalantly. "I can't help but think that this path has been trod before<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> by Urza, my teacher. He, too, assembled heroes—Planeswalkers and mortals—to battle Phyrexia. Even so, history remembers him as the monster this plane needed to defeat the monsters who threatened it."</p>
<p>"Was he a monster?" Wrenn asked.</p>
<p>Teferi pondered that question. Most on Dominaria would have said <em>yes</em>—those who'd actually known Urza emphatically so. But for Teferi, the answer wasn't so pat. "On Innistrad, I told you about Zhalfir. Remember?"</p>
<p>"Your homeland. The one you hoped I could help you find."</p>
<p>"I didn't tell you exactly how I lost it," he said. "You see, Urza petitioned me to be one of his titans. Yes, me. I had the great Urza Planeswalker begging me to join his merry band of heroes, and of course, I told him I would if he helped me first."</p>
<p>"A reasonable agreement."</p>
<p>"That's what he thought, too." Teferi clasped his hands together and rested his forehead on his fingers. "So, with his aid, I sealed shut a Phyrexian portal that had opened up in the skies above Zhalfir. When the task was done, and he demanded my help in return, I simply laughed and refused. 'You've only wanted to defeat your foes,' I told him. 'This is how I save my people. This is how you and I differ.' Then I siphoned energy from the closed portal to fuel a spell spiriting Zhalfir away from space and time itself. I didn't ask permission. I didn't care what the people of Zhalfir thought. So, you tell me—who is the monster?"</p>
<p>"Your tangle may prove too snarled. Even for me."</p>
<p>Teferi let out a dry laugh. "I was so damn proud of how easily I'd stolen his petty victory over me<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> for my own petty victory. That's the way we all are—all of Urza's children of fury."</p>
<p>"Children?"</p>
<p>"We who are touched by his actions," Teferi explained. "His students, his colleagues<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> even his enemies. We despise him, yet we follow in his footsteps like luckless understudies. I've smashed armies, sparing no mercy. I've vanquished those I deemed villains and maneuvered allies to their demise for my own ends. <em>For the greater good</em>, I told myself." Teferi picked up a small rock and hurled it into the mist. "A liar who lies about his lies, the true heir to Urza's mantle."</p>
<p>Teferi waited for Wrenn's response. The dryad sat in quiet contemplation of his confession. He had never told anyone the extent of his missteps, at least not this directly. The reasonable reaction would have been for Wrenn to planeswalk away.</p>
<p>Instead, Wrenn turned to him, waves of heat emanating from the fire contained within her chest, and said, "I am not here to provide you absolution, mage. Your crimes are your own, and you will answer for them in time. Ultimately, you are not important. Neither am I. Teferi and Wrenn are singular melodies. I am here to play my part in the symphony."</p>
<p>The sounds of more footsteps, this time the harsh tapping of metal-shod boots, caused Teferi and Wrenn to break off their conversation. Elspeth was walking resolutely toward them clad in a full suit of armor. Teferi stood to receive her.</p>
<p>"If you seek punishment," said Wrenn, "I am sure there are others happy to mete it out. For now, I shall depart." Seven reared up and stomped away, taking Wrenn with them.</p>
<p>Teferi raised his hand to address Elspeth, but like before, she stopped him as he started to speak.</p>
<p>"I'm leaving tomorrow," she said. Her hand rested on the hilt of the sword that hung on her belt. "Thank you for letting me rest under your roof."</p>
<p>"It's not my roof," said Teferi. "But you're welcome all the same."</p>
<p>"Also<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> I owe you an apology. Vivien thinks highly of you, and out of respect for her, I should not have spoken to you like I did." Satisfied, she spun on her heel like a trained soldier and began to walk back to the tower.</p>
<p>"Wait," Teferi called out. "I didn't know about Ajani."</p>
<p>Elspeth stopped and turned back around.</p>
<p>"None of us did," he continued. "I was there with him when it happened—when the compleation took hold. It almost seemed like he didn't know, either."</p>
<p>"This is no comfort," said Elspeth.</p>
<p>Teferi took his time with a response. It was a simple matter to say the truth was the truth. Isn't that what a great leader, a battle-hardened general would say? Isn't that what everyone needed him to be? Who was the true Teferi? Was it Teferi, mage of Zhalfir, who pledged to defend his home no matter the cost? Was it Teferi, master of time, the elitist, nigh-omnipotent planeswalker who thought everyone should simply get in line and follow? Or was it Teferi the disruptive student, who used cruel humor to obscure his own fears that no one would ever understand him, that no one would ever consider him a friend?</p>
<p><em>Get out of your head</em>. <em>Look with your eyes.</em></p>
<p>"Are you hungry?" Teferi asked.</p>
<p>"Hungry?" asked Elspeth, puzzled.</p>
<p>"Yes, have you eaten?" Teferi walked past and motioned for her to follow. "I've just realized that I haven't had so much as a crumb since this morning."</p>
<p>"Jodah provided me with some of his biscuits."</p>
<p>"Oh, then we should hurry."</p>
<p>With the cold, wet night air flowing through his robes, Teferi led Elspeth across the greenbelt to the tower proper, where they followed the wall around to a small patch of grass butted up against the tower's base. There, encircled by a globe of green energy, was a sprawl of vines bearing bulbous, pale green fruits. Teferi picked one and held it out to Elspeth.</p>
<p>"Mitab," Teferi said. He took another fruit and bit down into it, letting its juices flow out the sides of his mouth. He was aware he looked silly, not at all how a regal Planeswalker of old was supposed to comport himself. "Wrenn and I made a short stop in Jamuraa, my homeland, before coming back here."</p>
<p>Elspeth took the fruit and brought it to her lips. She tried to maintain decorum as she ate, but juice and fleshy bits of fruit stuck to her face no matter how careful she was. At some point, she gave up and began to eat faster, with more aplomb.</p>
<p>"I was hungrier than I thought," she said.</p>
<p>Teferi stared at the spell that Wrenn had woven to keep his mitab alive despite the vale's inhospitable climate. He reached down and hovered his hand within it, his fingers tingling as they grew warm. "I won't lie to you," he began. "You're right about our plan—it's yelling a prayer into a gale. But it's our best shot. We have a weapon capable of stopping the Phyrexians at the source. Right now, we're working on a way for me to learn how to use it. It's not perfect, but I must have faith that it's enough. For me, the fight against the Phyrexians isn't about being victorious."</p>
<p>Where was he headed with this? He'd always been so prepared. Even his practical jokes required extensive planning to pull off. But now, the words flowed out of him, first at a trickle, and then a torrent that he couldn't control. "I have a daughter," he said. "Her name is Niambi, and she<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> Everything I'm doing is about saving <em>her</em>. It's about her knowing that I did everything I could to save others while always remaining the person she knew, the father she loves. If I waver—if I have any doubt at all—I doom Niambi this very second."</p>
<p>"Then you do know," said Elspeth. "The terror that comes with hope."</p>
<p>No response was necessary. The remains of the mitab sat in his hands, the flesh eaten away leaving only the core and seeds. His fingers, covered in juice, glistened in the starlight. He placed the remains of the fruit onto the dirt underneath the vines and wiped his hands on his robes. In time, the heat of Wrenn's spell would bake the core dry, and worms would pull it under to nourish new plants.</p>
<p>"I should go," said Teferi. "Saheeli is waiting. I can escort you back to your room."</p>
<p>Elspeth refused. "I think I'll walk the grounds for a while. I like this weather."</p>
<p>"Then live on, Elspeth. Be well and happy. Safe journeys."</p>
<p>"If the Phyrexians are still on this plane," said Elspeth, "it's only a matter of time before they find this place. You will need someone to defend you if that happens—if they track us down."</p>
<p>"Us?"</p>
<p>"If you'll have me."</p>
<p>"We will. Gladly," said Teferi. "I hope we can get to know each other better."</p>
<p>Teferi turned and walked back toward the front of the tower. He managed only a few steps before a bright flash caused him to look over his shoulder. There, Elspeth stood with her sword unsheathed. Out of the globe-shaped pommel, tendrils of milky light spiraled outward, its radiance soft and warm like his earliest days spent under the Zhalfirin sun.</p>
<p>The pains of his wounds dulled, and his mind cleared, bringing forth a long-neglected memory: a flock of wattle-eyes that would pay regular visits to his home in Jamuraa. According to his father, they were the descendants of an injured bird he'd saved in his youth, a bird that lived under his family's roof as a full member until its wanderlust obliged it to leave. In the years, then decades, that followed, the bird had its own children that would regularly visit out of loyalty. Out of love. That's why the trees on his family's land always sang.</p>
<p>Eventually, Teferi became a wizard of repute, then a Planeswalker whose legend spread to other nations, other continents, other worlds. Still, in between waging bitter battles and accomplishing incredible magical feats, he'd recall the story of the birds and find comfort in hearing the low, soothing bass of his father's voice in his mind.</p>
<p><em>They do what they do out of love.</em></p>
<p>The tale itself he'd dismiss as his father's whimsy and nothing more—an extravagance perfect for children who needed a story to hold onto.</p>
<p>But not this time. This time, Teferi chose to believe.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>The Brothers' War | Chapter 5: Exodus</title><link>https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/magic-story/the-brothers-war-chapter-5-exodus</link><guid>https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/magic-story/the-brothers-war-chapter-5-exodus</guid><description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Read the roots, tell the tale</em></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Future forms in waving weeds</em></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Higher than truth is hope</em></p>

<p style="text-align:center;">—<em>Rootwater Saga</em></p>

<p>Before that rain-soaked morning, Nissa had spent a grand total of fifteen minutes on Dominaria—fifteen minutes of screaming at the closest friends she had. Chandra. Gideon. She'd had enough of being manipulated by Liliana and had enough of her friends blithely going along with it. <em>I can't bear to see another plane broken before I make my own home whole</em>, Nissa told them. <em>I'm sorry, but my watch is over.</em></p>

<p>Now she was back, along with Chandra. Dominaria wasn't yet broken, but Nissa got the sense, sitting at the meeting room table across from Kaya and Saheeli, both haggard and exhausted, that the plane was careening toward its breaking point.</p>

<p>"Things are happening fast," said Chandra. "Sorin and Arlinn are working together to shore up Innistrad's defenses. Samut has gone into hiding with Hazoret and the population of Amonkhet. At the same time, others are answering Jace's call for help. Some guy named Tyvar arrived just before we left."</p>

<p>"Tyvar Kell," said Kaya.</p>

<p>"Oh, you know him. Is he allergic to shirts or something?"</p>

<p>"Chandra, focus," said Nissa.</p>

<p>"Right," Chandra said. "When everything's set on Ravnica, Jace and company are coming here to rendezvous with Teferi and all of you. Then the strike teams leave for New Phyrexia while Liliana and I wait here as backup."</p>

<p>"How long do we have?" asked Saheeli, exchanging a troubled look with Kaya.</p>

<p>"Jace has it on good authority that the Mirrans are going to launch their offensive very soon," said Chandra. "It could be today or tomorrow. According to Vivien, Urabrask and the rebel Phyrexians are nearly ready as well. I don't know about anyone else, but I'm ready for some action right now."</p>

<p>Of course she was. Leaping before looking—that was the Chandra way.</p>

<p>Nissa, on the other hand, wanted to know more. She'd spent the last several months fulfilling her obligations to Zendikar. The goings-on in the wider Multiverse hadn't concerned her as much as the healing of her own plane. As of late, she'd been chasing down an ancient thresher beast unwittingly let loose by imprudent adventurers from the ruins of the Guul Draz Skyclave. She was in hot pursuit of the ravenous creature when Chandra showed up telling tales of planes Nissa had never heard of.</p>

<p>"What exactly are you doing on Dominaria?" Nissa asked.</p>

<p>"We're helping Teferi find information about how to use the sylex," said Saheeli.</p>

<p>"The sylex." Chandra stared into her empty cup, a grim expression on her face. "The thing that Jaya died for." Jaya Ballard? Nissa had spent days on Ravnica with Chandra learning all she could about who and what the Phyrexians were. They'd spent time talking together, eating together. Never did Chandra mention anything about Jaya's death.</p>

<p>"We're close," said Kaya, "but we need more time."</p>

<p>"You have until Jace gets here."</p>

<p>Kaya clenched her jaw. "Not good enough." Kaya related the details of her time on Kaldheim, home of the World Tree that connected the plane's various realms, and of encountering a Phyrexian creature there. Then she talked of meeting with Vivien Reid, who'd told them about Elesh Norn's secret strategy—a way to bind the planes to New Phyrexia. The conclusion wasn't hard to piece together after that. "If the Phyrexians have created their own tree, we'll need something powerful to destroy it," Kaya explained. "We have nothing without the sylex."</p>

<p>"Our best chance to destroy the Phyrexians is to team up with the Mirrans," Chandra insisted. "We can't pass that opportunity up."</p>

<p>"We are going as fast as we can," said Saheeli.</p>

<p>"Hold on," said Nissa. "Let's say we are able to destroy the World Tree. What happens to New Phyrexia?"</p>

<p>"I'm not sure," said Kaya. "If the tree is as deeply rooted as Kaldheim's, then it's not out of the question that the whole plane might go when the tree does."</p>

<p>Chandra had a more definitive take: "Good."</p>

<p>"How can you say that?" said Nissa. "The Mirrans are there fighting for their home!"</p>

<p>"Let's not get ahead of ourselves," said Saheeli. "We have no evidence that the sylex can detonate an entire plane. It was used on Dominaria millennia ago, and the plane still exists. We have to trust Teferi."</p>

<p>"I do trust him," said Chandra. "My point is that destroying the Phyrexians is the most important thing. No cost is too high."</p>

<p>Saheeli slid her chair away from the table and stood up. "I've already accepted that the lives of my loved ones may come at others' expense. But I will not give into bloodlust."</p>

<p>"I didn't<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> That's not what I meant."</p>

<p>"Then what did you mean?" snapped Nissa. She instantly regretted how harshly that came out. Why were things always so difficult between them, no matter how much they cared for each other?</p>

<p>Before Chandra could answer Nissa's query, Teferi appeared in the doorway. He was gaunt, looking like a corpse as he leaned on the doorframe.</p>

<p>"I'm ready," he said quietly, casting a kind but weary glance over to Nissa.</p>

<p>Kaya adjourned the meeting. She and Saheeli accompanied Teferi away from the room, leaving Chandra and Nissa by themselves. Nissa knew Chandra well enough to know that her silence was a brace holding back her vitriol. She could guess what Chandra would say next: <em>They didn't let me explain! They don't understand! Why can't they be sensible?</em></p>

<p>"I didn't<nbsp> . . .</nbsp>" said Chandra, averting her eyes away from Nissa. "This probably makes me sound like a monster, but<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> I want them all to die. All of them. Anything having to do with Phyrexians or Phyrexia. They don't deserve any mercy."</p>

<p>"You're not a monster," said Nissa. "But you're also not someone who revels in death."</p>

<p>"But I want them to suffer. They killed Jaya! Don't you understand that?"</p>

<p>"I do," said Nissa. "But like it or not, Ajani is one of them. Does he get thrown to the slaughter with the rest?"</p>

<p>"That's unfair, and you know it."</p>

<p>Chandra became silent. She sat at the table for a time, her hands folded on the table in front of her. Then, without so much as a murmur, she got up and left the room.</p>

<hr />
<p>The Phyrexian attack came in the dead of night.</p>

<p>Despite their dwindling numbers, the Phyrexian troops that survived Elspeth and Jodah's flanking attack pressed forward into the siege line, where they either got hung up on the barricade or funneled into pockets where equally relentless metal soldiers defending the tower tore into them. For the few that managed to cross the tower threshold, Nissa, Wrenn, and a handful of construct guardians were there to ensure they advanced no further.</p>

<p>"I'm losing my grip!" Nissa shouted over her shoulder. From across the room, Wrenn cast a spell, causing the end of the vine looped around the Phyrexian soldier's ankle to swell and harden until it snapped off its entire foot. The soldier toppled to the ground, allowing a clay statue to batter the Phyrexian with its club-like arms until it stopped moving. Over two dozen Phyrexians had met with similar fates in the tower hall, their bodies strewn about in various states of dismemberment. It seemed that victory for the defenders was all but assured.</p>

<p>"We beat them," she said, leaning on her knees. "Wrenn, we won."</p>

<p>Suddenly, a pillar of light scorched the sky outside the tower like a sun ascending, roaring fiercely over the sounds of battle. A moment later, a wave of steam blanketed the vale, engulfing enemy and ally alike. Nissa turned away from the heat, but Wrenn seemed unfazed; she and Seven stood in the middle of the tower's great hall, a limp Phyrexian soldier bent in half at Seven's feet.</p>

<p>Once the heat subsided, Nissa and Wrenn hurried out past the front courtyard, all the way up to the barricade. Phyrexian limbs dangled from still-smoldering spikes. Black, rank-smelling oil covered the metal soldiers, the ghostly golden glow of their eyes like pale will o' wisps floating in the gloom. And then the quiet—after the clang of weapons and the cacophony of screams echoing through the cavernous hallways of the tower had ceased, there was only the steady patter of rain on the dirt.</p>

<p>"Elspeth and Jodah," said Nissa. "I'm going to find them." She began to descend the steps, but Wrenn had Seven moved and block her path.</p>

<p>"Our role remains the same: to guard Teferi," said Wrenn.</p>

<p>"But<nbsp> . . .</nbsp>" But <em>nothing</em>. Wrenn was right. For all anyone knew, there was no one to be found. That blast was no simple light display. Sadly, if Elspeth and Jodah were out there, they were in all likelihood consumed by the magic, their lives given to protect the tower and all inside. Now the duty of getting Teferi and the sylex to New Phyrexia rested on her and Wrenn. "Okay," she said, her head hung in mourning. "Let's regroup with the others at the workshop."</p>

<p>Just as they started to move, explosions again rocked the tower halls. Nissa glanced back out into the front courtyard, but nothing looked different from the moment before. The metal soldiers stood as silent sentinels over the gore-covered battlefield. Where was the noise coming from?</p>

<p>"Above," said Wrenn.</p>

<p>Above and all around. Nissa gazed at the staircase. "Let me go up and see. Wait here and make sure nothing gets through." Wrenn gave the go-ahead, and Nissa scrambled all the way up to the second floor, to a wide hangar open to the elements. Jodah had sent out the thopter fleet from this location, which was now empty save for a few thopters in disrepair.</p>

<p>As below, so it was above on the western flank of the tower. Calm. Still. Not so to the east, toward the paths leading to the wild fields that approached the city of Argivia. The eastern watchtowers had come to life, spraying electrostatic bolts upward into the clouds, creating a false aurora that lit up the night with ribbons of bright green. Out of the haze emerged a battalion of knights, more than a hundred strong and fully outfitted in identical white suits of armor. Above them flew what at first Nissa thought was an angel. Perhaps it had been at one time. No longer. This winged monstrosity was composed of brindled strands of blood-red muscle except for its helmet, a hulking pyramid of stripped bone resting upon its shoulders.</p>

<p>Watching the advancing army, Nissa could only think of the Gatewatch—the original four—facing down the Eldrazi threatening to tear Zendikar asunder. There was camaraderie there, a clear sense of doing right. A naïve sense—Nissa understood that enough now. Still, she longed for the confidence that Gideon could instill in her, the fervor that only Chandra could stoke, balanced with Jace's calm under duress. But none of them were there. Jace was on Ravnica frantically preparing. Chandra left earlier in the day to join him. And Gideon<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> He wasn't coming.</p>

<p><em>But you're here</em>, she told herself. She took one more moment for herself and then ran back down to Wrenn. "Another wave of Phyrexians!" she cried.</p>

<p>"How many?"</p>

<p>"A whole army," she said. "If they get too close, we can't prevent them from entering the tower."</p>

<p>Wrenn stood tall. "Then we will stop them."</p>

<p>Nissa turned and led the way back out, not straight to the eastern fortifications but into the front courtyard. The best thing to fight an army was an army of your own. Luckily, she still had the semblance of one at her command.</p>

<p>"Arise!" Nissa screamed, recalling the control word Elspeth used to manage the mechanical army. Elspeth's plan had worked to preserve a large percentage of the defending garrison. The beetle-like metal soldiers numbered several dozen, and she counted six clay statue units still on their feet. They stomped to signal their attention and faced her. "Assemble and march!" she ordered, waving them on to follow her around the perimeter of the tower to meet the incoming force.</p>

<p>As before, the metal soldiers trudged in perfect time, pummeling the rain-soaked ground of the tower's greenbelt until it was a black sludge. They lined up on top of a low battlement on the eastern edge of the tower complex. Slinking through the tight spaces between soldiers, Nissa stepped up to the front of the battlement to survey the scene.</p>

<p>The Phyrexians had advanced close enough for Nissa to discern their ghastly armaments: blades and shields the color of bare bone, sinewy red at their edges. The angelic abomination hovered above the foot soldiers, gesticulating for what Nissa recognized as a complex protection spell. Sure enough, whenever turret fire came close to the enemy ranks, the bolts hit an invisible barrier and dissipated harmlessly.</p>

<p>Fortunately, elementals wouldn't be slowed down by such a barrier. Nissa reached her consciousness out to the earth and the air, inviting the spirits of the plane to inhabit bodies made of dirt and stone, wind and rain. Air currents began to stir. The earth between the armies bubbled and churned. <em>Defend yourself, Dominaria!</em></p>

<p>But upon sensing the presence of the nature spirits, she experienced something she never had before. They recoiled at her presence. <em>Now is the time to show your strength! </em>Nissa implored. They'd heard her—she could feel it—but her appeals went unanswered.</p>

<p>She looked to Wrenn. "Do you feel that? My magic<nbsp> . . .</nbsp>"</p>

<p>"Yes. The leylines are tangled. Intentionally, I believe."</p>

<p>The Phyrexian army loomed ever closer. There was no more time to wait. The enemy couldn't be allowed to reach the battlements—there would be no way to stop them from infiltrating the tower at that point. If nature would not heed her call, Nissa would have to march onto the battlefield with a legion of machines. But as adept as Saheeli's troops were at fighting, they were empty husks in comparison to the enemies advancing toward them. To Nissa in that moment, the Phyrexians were the crest of a wave meant to overwhelm not only the tower, but all bastions of life and hope everywhere, from Lorwyn to Innistrad to her beloved Zendikar.</p>

<p>With crushing force.</p>

<p>With hidden corruption.</p>

<p>With soul-destroying despair.</p>

<p>Nissa unsheathed the thin, tapered sword hidden in her staff and raised it into the air. "Forward!" she ordered. The mechanical soldiers, followed by lumbering clay statues, led the way down the rampart and onto the field. "Stand your ground! Defend the tower!"</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align:right;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/EWqNAKMGs5.jpg" />
<p class="embedImageCaption">Art by: <a href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&amp;output=spoiler&amp;method=visual&amp;artist=+[%22Chris%20Cold%22]" target="_blank">Chris Cold</a></p></div></div>

<p>The constructs assembled into a siege line into which the Phyrexians charged. The armies collided with sharp staccato thunderclaps. Metallic edges on both sides clanged against armor, searching for weak spots to bite, rip, and tear apart the enemy. The constructs, of course, did not feel fear, but the Phyrexians—their faces either obscured by helmets or replaced by smooth, featureless bone—did not relent, either. Worse, unlike the black-armored forces that had attacked earlier in the night, this white-armored legion showed a semblance of battle tactics. Gone were the berserker charges that left the enemy overextended. These Phyrexians were organized into squads of four or five, working together to pin down the machine warriors and attack from positions of strength.</p>

<p>The clay statues did not fare much better. After the first few Phyrexians lost their weapons in the statues' earthen flesh, they began to instead focus on quick jabbing attacks at the statues' weakest points—their legs. Two had already been tipped over into the mud by Phyrexians crushing the statues' feet and ankles with their heavy shields.</p>

<p>Wrenn tried to manage the battlefield by channeling her internal fire into a burning labyrinth of twisting, flaming corridors, splitting the Phyrexian line into vulnerable pockets for the construct warriors to charge into. But the stress of maintaining her spells while holding her ground against more and more enemies was clearly taking its toll. One Phyrexian swung its heavy blade onto the head of a construct, cutting it down and opening an avenue to attack Wrenn and Seven.</p>

<p>Nissa sprang forward, and sliding underneath the Phyrexian's swing, slashed her own weapon, only for it to glance off the bony plates protecting its abdomen. Back up on her feet, she narrowly dodged two more hefty swings before the Phyrexian pressed the attack. This time, she sidestepped its overhead smash and risked casting a simpler spell on the ground underneath its feet. The loose earth writhed, small plants and roots awakening to suck the Phyrexian's legs down into the muck. From there, a gang of mechanical soldiers finished it off.</p>

<p>Nissa once again gazed upward. The flying Phyrexian had hardly moved, content to maintain its vigil above the fighting, weaving protective spells to help its troops defend and recover from attacks. The strategy was a sound one: Grind the tower defenders down until none were left. Then take all those within the tower with ease. Even without magical support, the numbers did not favor Nissa and her allies. With it? No chance of victory. She had to take the general down.</p>

<p><em>Wrenn. </em>Nissa broke out into a sprint headed straight for Wrenn, ducking underneath Seven's sweeping boughs. "Wrenn! I need your help!"</p>

<p>"I'm somewhat occupied currently," Wrenn said as Seven kicked a Phyrexian over. "But I'm listening."</p>

<p>"The leader," she said, pointing upward. "I'm going to take it down."</p>

<p>"Your proposal?"</p>

<p>"A little gift of strength from me to you. Then I can climb Seven and go from there."</p>

<p>A rare smile appeared on Wrenn's face. "An acceptable plan."</p>

<p>Nissa pressed her hands to Seven's trunk, lending the strength from her own limbs into theirs. In so doing, she tapped into the wild inferno Seven helped Wrenn contain within her body. Nissa felt her lifeforce intermingle with the flames, but instead of being overwhelmed, Nissa found renewed magical energy—a leyline all its own. She channeled that newfound power into her spell, commanding Wrenn and Seven to grow. Grow stronger. Taller. Her spell in full effect, she felt one of Seven's leafy branches embrace her as if she were no larger than a mouse in an ogre's hand.</p>

<p>"It will see you coming if you climb," said Wrenn. "Seven, make her fly."</p>

<p>In one fluid movement, the now giant-sized Seven launched Nissa skyward, hurling her with such force that the rain stung her face like pinpricks. The winged Phyrexian twisted in mid-air, its awkward movements betraying its surprise at Nissa's unorthodox attack. Though it hoisted up one of its scythe arms to slash at her, she was faster and lighter. Hooking one arm around the creature's neck, Nissa jammed her sword deep into an unarmored section on the right side of its body. The creature swung its arms wildly to shake her off, but Nissa stubbornly held on.</p>

<p>Unable to throw her free, the Phyrexian commander stopped flailing, extended its wings fully, and began to ascend at frightening speed. Down below, the battlefield became a frantic lather of insects crawling over each other, then dots, and then nothing as she and the Phyrexian crossed into the darkness of the storm clouds. The cold air stung her eyes, forcing them closed.</p>

<p><em>No!</em> She would not permit the Phyrexian leader to re-establish contact with its troops. It would threaten no more of her friends, nor would its nightmarish machinations touch one more blade of grass on Dominaria, Zendikar, or anywhere else. Nissa tightened her arm around the Phyrexian's neck. Reaching down, she pulled her sword free from its ribcage and then thrust upward, skewering the knot of cables at the base of its wing again and again and again and again, the itchy warmth of its black blood coating her hand. The Phyrexian arched its back, trembling frantically as her sword's enchantment began to take effect. With each stab, she'd implanted a seed within the Phyrexian, and now, in the frigid Dominarian night, she beckoned the seeds to bloom.</p>

<p>Seedlings burst forth in a symphony of ripping flesh and cracking bone. Her enemy thrashed its arms and wings in vain; the seedlings had wrapped themselves around Nissa's limbs, helping her resist any attempt to shake her off. The Phyrexian began to fall, taking Nissa with it.</p>

<p>All Nissa could do was hold on. Within a few moments, the battlefield came back into view, morphing from pinpoints of light, to beetles struggling against teeth, to the chaotic churn of blood and oil. With only a thought's breadth to decide, Nissa bade her seedlings to let go. As she fell, she tried to collect herself enough to planeswalk. But her thoughts splintered, stretched among the recalcitrant spirits of nature, her friends inside the tower, the gulf left when she'd departed Zendikar, and, increasingly, her own impending death.</p>

<p>Nissa closed her eyes and prepared for impact, only to unexpectedly feel a truss of soft leaves under her back. Seven had extended their branches to catch her. Unfortunately, this opened their flank to the enemy. Cold, cold hands reached up for Nissa from beneath and tightened their fingers around her arms, her legs, jerking her onto the ground. She struggled to reach her feet, but each time she made progress, what seemed like a thousand armored limbs dragged her back down.</p>

<p><em>Help! Help us! </em>she called out—not with her voice, as her breath was being pressed out of her lungs, but with her mind. She felt herself sink into the ground, past the dirt and the roots, past the bedrock upon which the mountains rested, and still farther down into the innermost parts of the plane where she hoped to find its essence—the Worldsoul.</p>

<p><em>Why don't you answer? </em>Nissa screamed.<em> Can you not hear us?</em></p>

<p>Only silence followed. Nissa couldn't understand. On Zendikar, the Worldsoul was as close to her as her own breath. It communed with her. Trusted her. On Innistrad and Amonkhet, the Worldsouls were hostile; on Ravnica it was hidden; but on every plane it was at least <em>there</em>. Here, on Dominaria, it was as if a rot had festered deep inside the plane. No, not a rot—a <em>hatred</em> born of wounds unhealed and betrayals never rectified. The nature spirits who'd spurned her earlier made their presences known:</p>

<p><em>You are not one of Gaea's children</em>, they said in unison.</p>

<p>Gaea? Yes, that was the name the Worldsoul had chosen for itself. Nissa could sense Gaea close by, watching how she responded to the judgment of her agents who held dominion over Dominaria's untouched wilds.</p>

<p><em>There are invaders upon your plane</em>, Nissa implored. <em>You must help us defeat them!</em></p>

<p><em>The blighted ones have returned. We know.</em></p>

<p>Visions invaded Nissa's mind of dozens—hundreds—of battles taking place that same night. Massive, gray-skinned warriors led by stained-glass angels battling back Phyrexian horrors boiling up from the city sewers. Elven lords bedecked in warpaint riding atop metal war machines while human mages in flight hurled spells down upon many-horned beasts. Minotaurs desperately defending their sacred stone halls from biomechanical monstrosities, aided by goblin peasants showing no fear. Was this the nadir of Dominaria, the time just before its end?</p>

<p><em>You are a meddler come to drain Gaea's strength when her children need it.</em></p>

<p><em>I am a protector!</em> Nissa said. <em>See for yourself!</em> She opened her mind fully, allowing all to see and feel Zendikar through her. Her memories replayed as if she'd been a disembodied spirit witnessing all the parts of her life. From her first encounter with the soul of Zendikar, to defeating hordes of Eldrazi, to unleashing the healing power of the Lithoform Core. <em>If any of our homes are to be saved, it must start here! Help us, and we will end the Phyrexians—once and for all!</em></p>

<p><em>You are oathbreakers<nbsp> . . .</nbsp></em></p>

<p><em>How dare you recreate our doom<nbsp> . . .</nbsp></em></p>

<p><em>The silver one promised to take the sylex away<nbsp> . . .</nbsp></em></p>

<p>Nissa sought an egress from the darkness but found none. <em>Whatever promise Karn made to you doesn't matter anymore! Your enemies are upon you! </em>So dark. Quiet, like a tomb. But within this void, Nissa found clarity. If this was her final night as Nissa Revane, she resolved to die fighting in the name of Zendikar. No—in the name of life on all planes.</p>

<p><em>If you won't lend your aid, then return me to my fate. I will do it myself.</em></p>

<p>That was when she heard it—a faint rumble that steadily intensified into a roar that pressed upon her soul. <em>Gaea has judged you</em>, the spirits proclaimed, and in that moment, she felt a force reach into her and emerge through her as a moth from a chrysalis. The mana of the plane opened to her. Nissa's arms and legs became the roots of mighty oaks. Her hair became the wind, sharp as thorns. Her body became the ground, teeming with animals, insects, and plants alike. And then her heart.</p>

<p>Her heart became the wrath of Gaea, a simmering anger that boiled and frothed like a choleric tide washing over the entire vale. Life energy found new receptacles in the bodies of the fallen—both mechanical fighters and mangled Phyrexians. Gaea's would-be destroyers now reassembled themselves, their bodies of steel transmuted to heartwood, oil and powerstones converted into a circulatory system through which energy-rich sap flowed. With uncanny grace, the mass of elemental warriors embarked upon their procession toward the battlefield to fight for the survival of the plane.</p>

<p>Nissa sensed that this was not the first time Dominaria's Worldsoul had touched Phyrexia. Becoming one with the enemy was to invite it into you, to fathom its true motivations. Nissa's questions about the Phyrexians were answered. Flashes of history showed her how they arose, their attempts to take Dominaria for their own, and their aims that ran counter to everything natural.</p>

<p>All Nissa could do in response was scream.</p>

<p>Slowly, sensation began to creep back into her awareness, first a tingling at her extremities, then all at once flaring into all-consuming agony throughout her body. Such anguish she'd never felt before. Such hatred she'd never thought possible emanating from her heart. Her eyes shot open. Only a fraction of a second seemed to have elapsed since she was pulled onto the ground, bone white appendages reaching down to seize her.</p>

<p>But in that moment, everything had changed.</p>

<p>She lunged out on instinct, willing the ground underneath her to churn and strike out at her attackers. This time, the elements immediately bent to her command as if they were extensions of her own body. Earthen tendrils burst upward, forcing away the Phyrexians crowding around her. Nissa came to her feet in time to witness Gaea's protectors pouring down the tower ramparts. They flooded the battlefield, engaging the remaining Phyrexians in a titanic crash.</p>

<p>In the chaos, Nissa spotted Wrenn and Seven striding toward her, sweeping Phyrexians away from their path. When they got close, Seven scooped Nissa up with a bough and held her as they ran back toward the tower's battlements.</p>

<p>"A dirge drifts in from the mountains," said Wrenn. "We must return to Teferi."</p>

<p>"I know," Nissa said. Peering between Seven's branches, she could see the elemental fighters holding the bone-clad Phyrexians at bay like an undulating wall, each fallen enemy being subsumed by Gaea's will and raised as a warrior for her cause. It was as glorious as it was terrifying. Nissa understood the sacrifice that it took, for even a Worldsoul was not infinite. In other parts of the plane, Dominaria's heroes fought against Phyrexian invaders. The presence of the spirits here meant they were not elsewhere to aid others. Thousands would not see the morning.</p>

<p>When they reached the battlement, it was eerily deserted. Motionless. Seven placed Nissa onto the ground, and together, she and Wrenn watched the struggle on the battlefield. Earlier, Nissa had felt it—the flow of life intermingling with the Phyrexian yearning for destruction. It was a microcosm of their fight against all Phyrexians everywhere.</p>

<p>"Nissa, we are not alone."</p>

<p>Nissa followed Wrenn's eyeline to the base of the tower. Dragging itself toward them was the Phyrexian angel, its wings clipped and spine shattered, the hilt of Nissa's sword still protruding from its back. The green seedlings had flourished into vines wrapping themselves around the general's body like a new skin. With irresistible vigor, Nissa stepped forward, her hand extended. She curled her fingers, urging the vines to tighten.</p>

<p>"Do your masters experience sensation through you?" she asked the Phyrexian. "Do they feel it when I squeeze? I want them to know what we are going to do to them—to all of you. Not a simple end, no." She squeezed harder. Vines coiled around the Phyrexian's neck and began to twist.</p>

<p>"Nissa, stop," said Wrenn. "Yours is not a song of cruelty!"</p>

<p><em>No, but it must be.</em> Those voices in Nissa's head. The spirits. <em>We know this enemy, and in your heart, we see that it has already claimed those you love. They are forever lost. Victory over the blighted ones will require your hands to bear the blood of friend and foe alike.</em></p>

<p>With those final words, the spirits departed, and with them left the rage. Nissa staggered forward a step, a gulp in her throat set free. Gaea had shown her what Phyrexians did if left unchecked—they invaded, subsumed, transformed, and then feasted. That knowledge did not go away; she'd see it in her dreams for the rest of her days. Nissa stared at the Phyrexian on the ground in front of her. No matter how broken it was, coursing through its limbs was glistening oil, a foul seed from which Phyrexia could always emerge. Perhaps the same was true for Ajani, for Karn if he'd been turned, for any others corrupted by the Phyrexians. When the time came to do what was necessary to protect the Multiverse, she would have to be decisive. She would have to be the hand that moved for those who could not.</p>

<p>Nissa closed her eyes and clenched her fingers tight. The vines obeyed her command.</p>

<hr />
<p>When Wrenn and Nissa reached Saheeli's workshop, the stone wall around the door had been torn open, pushing aside the metal door and barricade. They stepped through into the chamber. Black smoke, the kind that burned with every breath, permeated the room. Through the haze, Nissa could make out more figures than the two she was expecting, all surrounding the Temporal Anchor.</p>

<p>Her heart sank at the thought that Phyrexians had gotten past the defenses. Nissa summoned wind to blow the smoke away and prepared to call upon Gaea's elementals one more time to smash their enemies. But when the smoke lifted, Nissa saw that at least one of the figures was someone she knew.</p>

<p>"Nissa," said Nahiri, her hands raised in supplication. "Stand down."</p>

<p>"Why are you here?" said Nissa, maintaining the swirling winds above their heads.</p>

<p>"Because I asked her to be," said Jace, stepping into view. "We can't afford to turn away any allies in this fight. I hope you understand." His words were stern, but his expression was one of contrition. In the days before Nissa came to Dominaria, Jace had reached out to her to meet and talk—invitations she'd left unanswered. She knew that she couldn't let Chandra be their go-between forever. They'd have to talk their differences out eventually, but right now, there were more important matters to attend to.</p>

<p>Nissa dismissed the winds while stealing a glance at Nahiri to see her reaction. The kor was as stone-faced as ever. Closer to the Temporal Anchor were Saheeli and Kaya, both surveying extensive damage to the machine. Wires and circuitry spilled out of gashes in the anchor's charred metal frame, like guts from a corpse. Debris packed the middle, as if the anchor had been crushed into itself. "What happened?"</p>

<p>"The powerstone imploded and overloaded the anchor," said Saheeli, lifting wreckage away from the machine. "I tried to hold it together, but the strain was too much."</p>

<p>"And Teferi?" Jace asked. "Did he find out how to make the sylex work?"</p>

<p>Kaya shook her head. "He did, but some things still don't make sense. It took everything I had just to maintain contact. A mess of words and images<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> I think I understand how to activate the sylex, but we should ask him directly."</p>

<p>"Where is he?"</p>

<p>"There." Kaya pointed to the stasis capsule at the center of the anchor.</p>

<p>Nissa, Wrenn, Nahiri, and Jace aided Saheeli and Kaya to clear a path to the stasis capsule. Once that was done, Kaya was the first to step in.</p>

<p>"Teferi," she said, knocking on the hollow shell. "Are you okay?" After not hearing an answer, she leaned in closer and wiped the grime away from the small porthole in the capsule's door. Cupping her hands around her face, she peered inside. "I can see him, but it's dark<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> Wait—something's wrong."</p>

<p>"What?" said Jace, pushing his way forward. Nissa followed close behind and saw at the same time Jace did. Teferi was inside, his eyes closed, a distressed expression on his face. He looked so pale and sickly. No, that wasn't it. He was disappearing before their eyes. She and Jace reached for the door release at the same time, only for Wrenn to call out for them to stop.</p>

<p>"Teferi's chord is still tethered to this device," said Wrenn. "It reverberates with his song. You must not disturb it."</p>

<p>Jace stepped back and concentrated, reaching out his mind to Teferi's. "Wrenn is right. He's still there, but stretched, as if across distant places. Or different times."</p>

<p>Saheeli began to pace, speaking to no one in particular. "I could try to rebuild the anchor again. Maybe reverse the systems to draw him forward through the timestream." She stopped and looked at Jace. "How long do we have left?"</p>

<p>"No time," Jace said with a frown. "Kaya, without Teferi—"</p>

<p>"I can do it," Kaya shot back. "I'll get the sylex to work."</p>

<p>"We can't just leave him," Nissa protested. "The Phyrexians are all over this plane. They're going to come back here."</p>

<p>"The Mirran attack is almost underway," said Nahiri. "That's why we're here now—to gather you and leave for New Phyrexia."</p>

<p>"We can't let him die alone," said Nissa.</p>

<p>"Not alone," called out a voice from the doorway. Leaning against the broken doorframe was Jodah, grimacing while holding his midsection. "And not to die. If I let that happen, he'd never let me hear the end of it."</p>

<p>A moment later, Elspeth stepped out from behind him, and draping his arm over her shoulder, supported him as they both shambled into the room. Nissa had no idea how they'd survived that blast, but it was apparent that they'd only barely done so. Guiding Jodah to a seat at one of Saheeli's worktables, Elspeth sat him down and pressed a small flask into his hand. Then she strode to the middle of the room.</p>

<p>"My name is Elspeth Tirel," she said, extending her hand to Jace.</p>

<p>"I know." Jace took her hand, a gleam in his eye Nissa recognized. He'd felt Elspeth's mind long before she made her appearance. "Jace Beleren."</p>

<p>"You are going to New Phyrexia."</p>

<p>"We are. Once we're done here."</p>

<p>"Then I'm coming with you. You'll need someone who knows the lay of the land."</p>

<p>"And your companion?" said Jace, eyeing Jodah with an expression Nissa could only describe as discomfort. "I<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> I can't—"</p>

<p>"Do you think you're the first mind-mage I've dealt with, Beleren?" Jodah said with a venom-laced smirk. "You're neither the first, nor the best. But give it a few hundred years, and maybe you'll get there." His eyes strayed to the capsule housing Teferi, the smile fading from his face. "I am Jodah, Archmage of Dominaria, and right now, my aim is helping my friend. I'll work on freeing Teferi while you lot go off to the most awful place in the Multiverse. Sound good?"</p>

<p>"I didn't mean to offend you."</p>

<p>"Don't worry about being polite," Jodah said. "Worry about being careful, for your companions' sake."</p>

<p>"I will remain here as well," said Wrenn. "My dealings with Teferi are not concluded."</p>

<p>Soon, others began to planeswalk in. Vraska in green and black armor befitting the Golgari queen; The Wanderer, elegant and fierce, accompanied by a young man with a shorn head whom she introduced as Kaito Shizuki; Tyvar, still with no shirt; and finally, a grizzled, distant man, graying at the temples, with a jaw clenched as he took in the rubble-strewn environment.</p>

<p>"Lukka, this is Nissa Revane."</p>

<p>"Hmm," was all Lukka said, paying her minimal attention.</p>

<p>"And Chandra?" Nissa asked Jace. Chandra had left Dominaria earlier in the day with a promise to return. Where was she?</p>

<p>"Kaladesh," Jace replied. "To visit her mother before coming back here."</p>

<p>Nissa nodded. To wait with Wrenn and Liliana and the others. To see if they would come back. It was understandable. Still, Nissa had hoped to see Chandra again before marching into hell, if only to settle things after their heated conversation that morning. To tell her that she had a point. To tell her that she cared. But that would have to wait, like her matters with Jace. Suspended inside a pause.</p>

<p>Everyone made their final preparations before leaving. Saheeli promised to convey Nissa's warmest regards to Pia and enjoy a stiff drink in Yahenni's memory. Wrenn and Jodah conferred with each other on the next steps to bring Teferi back. Kaya traced her finger across the surface of the sylex, studying its symbols, before carefully wrapping it up for the journey ahead. Elspeth introduced herself to the other Planeswalkers, informing them on what they could expect on New Phyrexia. Jace wove a spell establishing a telepathic link between all the strike team members. This way, they could locate each other, even over distance.</p>

<p>Nissa stood away from them all, preferring to meander among the wreckage of the Temporal Anchor. The Gatewatch had assembled once more. On Ravnica—the last time the original four members were together—they renewed their vows to the Multiverse, to each other. This time, though, was different. The quiet schisms between her and Jace, between her and Chandra, were laid bare, like wounds reopened. They wouldn't be fixed by a mere recitation of familiar phrases. But they didn't need to be.</p>

<p>Nissa watched all the others with her in the room, friends and strangers from multiple planes assembled just as the disparate people of Dominaria had come together, overcoming their divides and forging a united front. There was something beautiful in that. Something worthy. Something vital that Nissa had not considered. The struggle against the Phyrexians wasn't simply pushing back against the sick plans enacted by a singular megalomaniac like Nicol Bolas, nor was it a task for Planeswalkers to undertake alone. All beings who hoped for any kind of future faced a choice: allow the Phyrexians to transform every plane into the bleak, charred wastelands Nissa witnessed through Gaea's eyes, or fight alongside others who may once have been enemies.</p>

<p>Honoring their differences. Forging new bonds that would prevail and endure.</p>

<p>Jace announced that the time had come to leave, and everyone going to New Phyrexia gathered around him. Nissa walked toward the center of the room to join them, stopping momentarily when she noticed something small skittering around amid the debris. Kneeling down, she brushed away the ash and scrap to uncover a tiny artifact bird, for sure one of Saheeli's creations. It had her meticulous craftsmanship sprinkled with a bit of playfulness. The bird hopped onto her finger, and Nissa lifted it up to take a closer look. It craned its neck, looked Nissa right in the eye, and let out a tiny metallic tone like the tinkling of morning dew dripping into a still pond.</p>

<p>"For the life of every plane," she whispered, "We will all keep watch."</p>

<h2>Epilogue</h2>

<p><strong>?????????</strong></p>

<p>Teferi woke up on a beach on a warm day. The sand was fine and close packed, damp, only just now starting to dry. He breathed into the sand, blinking as the fine grains irritated his eyes.</p>

<p>A small crab walked across his hand, stopped before him, and blew bubbles. It scurried away.</p>

<p>He felt it walk across his hand.</p>

<p>He felt it.</p>

<p>Teferi sprang to his feet, brushing sand from his body. He was no longer a spirit. He was whole, but he was not in the Temporal Anchor. He felt<nbsp> . . .</nbsp></p>

<p>Fine. Rested. Confused, as if he had woken from a nap. He looked around, taking in the coast on which he stood.</p>

<p>The sea stretched out to the horizon, azure and glittering under the midday sun.</p>

<p>Inland, fine white sand stretched up the shore until it met green beachgrass and dunes. Old footprints showed people often walked here, though Teferi was alone right now. The low and placid coast arced away on either side of the dunes. To the left, the coast stretched for about a mile before rising into a rocky, vertical cliff. Shore trees clung to the cliff's pate, a windswept green thatch that collected mist and danced in the distance. To Teferi's right, the beach rolled along into the hazy distance.</p>

<p>Shore birds hovered overhead, riding the steady ocean breeze.</p>

<p>"Kaya," Teferi said. He frowned. He felt his voice vibrate through his throat, heard it with his ears under the soft roar of the coast wind. There was no connection; he had just spoken her name aloud.</p>

<p>The severity of his situation thrummed through him, carried in the sound of the rushing of his blood once more through his physical body.</p>

<p>If he couldn't connect to Kaya, he couldn't connect to the Temporal Anchor. If he couldn't connect to the Anchor, then he couldn't come home. Teferi could only hope that Kaya had gotten what she needed from his conversation with Urza. Did he remember feeling her presence there, or did he imagine that memory? Already he struggled to remember, already he began to forget. The river, subsuming the lake.</p>

<p>What had he forgotten? What did he do?</p>

<p>He only hoped Kaya had been able to get what they needed. If Kaya couldn't remember what he lost, then—</p>

<p>"No," Teferi said, speaking only to himself and the shore birds.</p>

<p>This was not the time to panic; this was only a problem, just another obstacle to overcome. He looked up the beach, toward the old footprints in the sand. There were people here. If there were people, there was hope.</p>

<p>Teferi put his back to the ocean and started walking inland.</p>

<p>Ten miles from the golden domes of Tomakul, Farid sat on the fire step of an old trench and used his knife to chip apart his frozen stew. Stoked with shattered arrow shafts and small wads of packing paper, the coals under the stewpot—his own brass cap, its liner removed—soon had the frozen slurry thawed and simmering. Without reverence, Farid shook the last of his salt out of a small tin into the broth, stirred, and felt his stomach twist with hunger at the thin scent of wild garlic and onions. The smell drew the rats out of their holes as well, but the cold made them sluggish. Farid watched one creep toward his rag-wrapped boots and stop to sniff him. It was fat, large as the golden cats that lounged in Tomakul's temple district streets, and carried itself with the same languid, waddling confidence. The rats owned the trench; the humans huddling in it were just temporary occupants, and food if they died. Farid kicked it away.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align:right;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/E5KhSE0CiS.jpg" /><p class="embedImageCaption">Art by: <a href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&amp;output=spoiler&amp;method=visual&amp;artist=+[%22Thomas%20Stoop%22]" target="_blank">Thomas Stoop</a></p></div></div>

<p>Their trench neared two decades old, a relic of the early war expanded into something resembling the great earthworks Farid had seen during the retreat out of the trans-Mardun territories of Yotia. Down where the Mardun river bordered Kroog, they had trench lines reinforced with squat stone towers. Bunkers that hid heavy bolt-throwers, subterranean hospitals and mess halls, weather-sealed bunks that were lit and warmed by smokeless powerstones. But all that was a year and miles behind him, abandoned after the Argivians and their allies began their counterattack. Life on the Mardun front was cold and boring until it wasn't.</p>

<p>Farid's war had been one year-long walk home with mechanized death at his back and pestilence where he slept. Every illusion he had of glory, honor, and adventure was ground to pulpy meal, pressed into the mud along with honor and humanity. Each trench Farid's unit had retreated to had been older, shallower, and found in greater disrepair. When the war was last this close to Tomakul, there had been no machines, just foot soldiers and cavalry; only the qadir's closest advisors knew what a dragon engine was, no one had seen an avenger, and Farid hadn't yet been born.</p>

<p>When Farid and his unit first tumbled into this trench, exhausted and bloodied by the artificer's cavalry, they found it a shallow ditch that stretched for a handful of miles across the valley floor, flooded, home only to the rats and the dead. They dug down into the earth, bailed out the water, and reinforced this old line for the realities of modern warfare. Now it was home, with underground dugouts to hide from thopter bombers on clear days, sapper-dug traps to sink advancing avengers and triskelions into the mud, and thickets of needle-wire strung across the front-facing side to tangle any charging enemies.</p>

<p>A month of cold work and thin living followed. Talk burbled through the trench of an attack, but Farid did not put too much stock in talk. Soldiers talked; attacks were slow, grand things these days. They needed soldiers to replace the dead and reinforce the living and officers to holler and shine. Thankfully, it seemed the generals never wanted to attack unless they had at least one dragon engine, or a division of the qadir's own machine soldiers to try and break the enemy line.</p>

<p>So, Farid cleaned his spear, kept his boots patched, rotated his socks, and cooked. This morning it was a stew. When it was ready, Farid poured a portion into Karrak's cup first, then the rest into his own. Farid nudged his friend, who sat wrapped in two cloaks, staring at the opposite wall of the muddy, frost-webbed trench.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align:right;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/o2hQjdZpyn.jpg" /><p class="embedImageCaption">Art by: <a href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&amp;output=spoiler&amp;method=visual&amp;artist=+[%22Bruno%20Biazotto%22]" target="_blank">Bruno Biazotto</a></p></div></div>

<p>"Food," Farid said. He had to shove Karrak again before he noticed. Karrak looked over, coughed, took the stew, and ate.</p>

<p>Farid blew on his own cup, sipped, and let the warm broth filter through him. He chewed a chunk of sodden bread and watched as a line of soldiers tromped around the sharp corner of the trench. They walked in single file, shuffling along the plank floor to keep their boots free of the rimy mud underneath. Eyes downcast, the soldiers all looked the same. The mud here dried pale, caking their boots and wool uniforms, staining the once-fine colors of the Imperial Fallaji army from dusty reds to cold shades of white, tan, and brown. All wore their helms wrapped in dark cloth, to prevent the sun from shining off the polished brass. They walked through the trench, short-stepped to not clip the heels of the soldier in front, shuffling to not be clipped by the soldier behind. Some leaned on their spears as they walked. All bowed under the weight of their packs.</p>

<p>"Hey," Farid said, calling up to the soldiers marching past. "Where are you going?"</p>

<p>None of them answered. Few even acknowledged him, and those that did just looked him over with fatigue-sunken eyes while they shuffled by. An older soldier whose coat bore a set of sewn-on sergeant's stripes passed, and Farid called out to her, asking where they were headed.</p>

<p>"Making room," the sergeant said. She stopped to adjust her pack, perching on the fire step. "Replacements due in this afternoon."</p>

<p>Farid cursed. Replacements. "They human?"</p>

<p>The sergeant shook her head. "All we were told was to make room for 'em. You have any more of that soup?"</p>

<p>It was Farid's turn to shake his head. "Just broth and bones now. What do you have?"</p>

<p>The sergeant thought for a moment, then fished into her coat. She pulled out a golden coin and held it out to Farid. It was one of the old ones, thick, with the last qadir's face stamped on both sides.</p>

<p>"For when you go home," the sergeant said. "Live like a qadir for a day in Tomakul, or an emperor for a week anywhere else."</p>

<p>Farid offered the sergeant the remains of the broth. She drank it down, then held the makeshift stewpot tipped to catch the last drops.</p>

<p>"Here, take this," Farid said, passing the sergeant one of the broth bones when he finished. "It's chicken, not rat."</p>

<p>"Chicken! Where did you find one of those?" The sergeant, grateful, took one of the bones.</p>

<p>"That miracle I cannot reveal," Farid said. "The quartermaster would have my head for it." He held a gloved finger to his lips, then pocketed the rest of the chicken bones in a pouch he wore at his waist. "Keep the coin. When you're qadir for a day, send us somewhere warm to dig a trench."</p>

<p>The sergeant laughed. She set the coin down on the fire step next to Farid anyways.</p>

<p>"For when you're home, my boy," the sergeant said, smiling.</p>

<p>Farid saluted. The sergeant nodded and hurried on to join the rest of her regiment as they shambled away. The unit passed through the trench for a few more minutes, the marching soldiers silent but for coughing, and the creaking and squelching of the trench's soggy floorboards. The wounded brought up the rear of the column—those who could walk, who could still carry and thrust a spear, were sent back to the front—shuffling with their heads down and eyes distant.</p>

<p>"A sorry lot we are," Karrak said. He'd come back from his distant staring. A wet cough roughened his voice. "Are you going to take that gold?" he asked Farid, eyeing the coin the sergeant had left on the fire step.</p>

<p>Farid looked at the coin. The sun had started to burn away the mist, and the gold gleamed in the cold morning light. He passed it to Karrak, who bit it and checked the impression. Satisfied, he tucked it into a pocket deep in his coat.</p>

<p>"Replacements, she said?" Karrak grunted.</p>

<p>"Replacements," Farid agreed.</p>

<p>"I hope they're machines," Karrak said. "Some of Mishra's. Not those dead things." Karrak coughed. "No more meat for this beast."</p>

<p>"I say give us the dead ones if it means we can go home," Farid said. "Let the qadir and his brother fight this war with their toy soldiers."</p>

<p>Karrak shrank into his coat and shivered. Farid reached out an arm and pulled him close. He could feel the heat Karrak threw off, like a brazier filled to the brim with coals. The same plague that had savaged him just two weeks prior, Farid guessed.</p>

<p>An officer—a captain in a pristine uniform but for mud-stained boots—brought up the rear of the marching soldiers. Farid noticed him a second too late. Cursing, he stood. Karrak struggled, but Farid hauled his friend up and held him as the captain marched past. The two of them saluted and the captain ignored them, consulting instead a sheaf of orders that a runner had passed him. The runner, a youth in a similarly pristine uniform, paced alongside, hopping between the fire step and the plank walkway above the muddy trench floor, taking notes as the captain rattled off orders to be dispersed to various units up and down the line.</p>

<p>Farid and Karrak and the rest of the men in their section stood for as long as it took for the captain to pass. When the officer turned the corner and was out of sight, they sat back down on the fire step, slouched back into their dugouts, and curled back up to sleep.</p>

<p>Winter's deep chill sank into Farid. He watched over Karrak as his friend shivered. Officers, movement, replacements, and reinforcements–activity. Nothing good could come of activity. Activity meant action, and action meant going over the top, into the blades and fire of the machines.</p>

<hr />
<p>The replacements arrived the next day, stooped under their heavy packs, yet to be lightened by the practicalities of war. They were human, not Mishran automatons or those stinking mechanical corpses; a mix of old men and women, out-of-place youths drawn from the farthest corners of the empire, haggard soldiers ferried over from the newly pacified Sarinth, and convicts. The replacements tromped through the trenches, eyes down, under the silent stares of the soldiers long on the line.</p>

<p>Some looked to Farid as if they came from Tomakul, though most of the replacements seemed to be desert types: thin before arriving at the front, either swallowed by their uniforms or barely able to fit into them. A scattering of Zegonians passed, talking in their quiet tongue. A pair of broad, tattooed Sumifans marched past, a nervous song on their lips that left a taste of ozone on the air. A penal unit marched by at a quick step, closely watched by their broad and rough-tongued minders, the lot of them simmering with such a mix of fear, desperation, and brutality that Farid was glad to see them continue down the line, not stopping at his post.</p>

<p>Some of the replacements carried themselves with an air of defiance, but most peered out at the brasscaps with wide eyes, all pity and fear; the front never looked like what you wanted it to. Farid recalled that he had expected to see knights and champions and all that when he first arrived; instead, he found a city compressed into a canal of gray stone and mud a dozen yards wide and miles long, populated by fearsome and beautiful warriors with equally fearsome and beautiful weapons, all arranged toward the glittering Mardun and the ruins of Kroog beyond the river.</p>

<p>Truth was, the front was hell: a nightmare made by men. You dare look too long at its population, and you'd see what you would become: hollow-eyed and sinewy, caked with mud. Gaunt soldiers in uniforms bleached and patched and stained. Farid was glad that moment was behind him. Better to already be the ghost.</p>

<p>At last, the officers came. Lieutenants by their stripes and sashes, shepherding the replacements to their new posts. The young officers carried that Tomakul sturdiness about them and, unlike the soldiers they led, actually wore brass caps and rose cloaks trimmed in gold cloth. Their armor was polished, and they still carried swords. Farid, broke away from the marching mass of soldiers with a squad of replacements in tow.</p>

<p>"Soldier," the lieutenant called to Farid. "What company are you in?"</p>

<p>Farid stood from the fire step and brushed his trousers flat. "D Company," he said, saluting. "Third Tomakul Spears, commanded by Colonel—"</p>

<p>"Sure, fine, that'll do," the lieutenant said. "These are yours, spearman." The lieutenant waved the squad of replacements forward. "Welcome to D company of the Third Tomakul Spears," he said to the replacements. "That spearman will be your senior here," the lieutenant said, pointing to Farid. "Look to him for guidance. I'll be in the officers' dugout that way," the lieutenant waved down the line. "Parade is an hour after dawn tomorrow under the company flags. Dismissed." The lieutenant tugged his brass cap, adjusting it, and then squelched off through the muddy trench, leaving the replacements to Farid.</p>

<p>As soon as the young officer was away down the trench, Farid swore, slumped free of his rigid parade stance, and waved the replacements over. Ten men—mostly youths a few years younger than him and an ancient veteran missing an eye—walked together in a rattling clump of brown wool coats, packs, and long spears.</p>

<p>"Welcome to the Argivian Front," Farid said. "I'm Farid of the Tomakul. This here is Karrak of the Suwwardi," Farid said. "The rest you'll meet at some point. Talk to the quartermaster down that way, she'll get you your regimental patch and some thread to stitch on the company letter," Farid thumbed down the trench, and the replacements all turned to look. "Any of you from Tomakul? Or are you all from the desert tribes?"</p>

<p>The group nodded. The older veteran stared forward with his good eye. He had the same look as Karrak—he was anywhere but here; he was nowhere at all.</p>

<p>"I'd never been out of the city before the war," Farid said to the assembled replacements. "Never been out in the deep desert—I heard it got cold at night, but never expected this. At least the Mist Moon is a great beauty." Farid looked around at the wide-eyed replacements. Nothing there but fear. "Why are you standing?" He said to them. "Grab a seat, find a bunk."</p>

<p>There were little cavities and burrows dug into the trench wall and reinforced by planks, their muddy floors covered with strips of burlap and torn clothing taken from dead soldiers. The replacements scrambled to grab the good ones. Each vacant dugout burrow had housed someone who went over the wall and never came back, and the dead always left small trinkets behind; if you were lucky, you might find something valuable to trade to the quartermaster for smokes or nabiz.</p>

<p>"Have you seen the enemy, sir?" one of the younger replacements asked as they settled into the dugouts. "The Argivians and their machine devils?" The replacement swam under his brown, undyed cloak. He carried a spear, around the blade of which a thin ribbon of rose silk was tied. Farid first thought it a favor from a beloved that the boy had tied on, but as he looked at the replacements' weapons, he realized they all had a similar ribbon fastened to their spears. That was the new mark of regiment, Farid realized. No more brass caps for the brasscaps. The boy, like the rest of the replacements, wore only a soft field cap with flaps tied down over his ears instead of the proud helms Farid and the rest of the long-deployed soldiers had been issued. They must need the metal for more automatons, Farid figured.</p>

<p>"I have seen them," Farid said. "Their machines as well."</p>

<p>"How many have you killed?" the replacement asked, eager.</p>

<p>Farid thought for a moment, recalling what he could of his year on campaign. He shrugged. "I don't think I've killed any."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>Farid looked to Karrak. "Have you killed any Argivians? Any Yotians?"</p>

<p>Karrak, always bundled, shook his head. "None," he rasped from his wrappings. "I seen many dead. Never killed one myself."</p>

<p>"Come to think of it, I've never even clashed with one blade to spear," Farid said. He flashed the long knife he wore at his side, then nodded toward his can opener—a sturdy pike about as tall as he, with a flat head that tapered to a sharp point.</p>

<p>"These are can openers. We use them on Urza's machines—though I've only ever used mine on fallen avengers and thopter wrecks," Farid said. "Closest I've been to using these in a proper fight was when we followed a unit of scythe runners into a trench. All the Argivians were dead by the time we arrived."</p>

<p>"Seen many dead," Karrak agreed.</p>

<p>"Told you." One of the other replacements said, nudging his fellow. "Trench rats," he said. "Disgraceful cowards. No wonder the Argivians have pushed us so far from Kroog—nothing but soft city-dwellers between them and the heart of our empire."</p>

<p>Farid and Karrak laughed. Some of the other soldiers who had been eavesdropping chuckled, shook their heads, and continued resting, eating, or maintaining their worn equipment.</p>

<p>"The Argivians are only two hundred yards that way," Farid said, thumbing over his shoulder in the direction of the Argivian trench. "You want to storm their line? Wait another hour—the rising sun will be at your back and then you can strike like the midday sun on the head of a waterless traveler," Farid said.</p>

<p>"That—that is exactly what we should do!" The replacement spluttered. He was the bravest of his companions, but they all nodded along with him. "Why are we not driving them off our land?"</p>

<p>Farid stood from the fire step and stepped toward the young man. "How old are you?" he asked, sizing up the youth.</p>

<p>"Fifteen," the replacement said, looking to the side but not stepping back. The boy stood an inch or so taller than Farid, who affected a permanent stoop after this time in the trenches.</p>

<p>"What's your name, boy?"</p>

<p>"Assad."</p>

<p>Farid drew his knife. Assad stepped back, bumping into his companions.</p>

<p>Farid grinned, then turned and stabbed his knife deep into the plank wall of the trench behind him. He levered out a chunk of rotting wood, sheathed his knife, and reached into the earth. He pulled a double handful of clay out from the cavity, dug a few scrapes deeper, and then wrenched something from deep inside the trench wall. He turned and held out a rag-wrapped length of bone, matted hair still clinging to the fetid remains.</p>

<p>"You're younger than this trench," Farid tossed the bone to the ground at the youth's boots. "But not by much." He pointed to the ragged, soggy bone. "Look at that bone. That was a person—can you tell me which uniform they wore?"</p>

<p>The youth stared at the bone and did not answer. The rest of his cadre were silent.</p>

<p>"This land doesn't matter," Farid growled. "You got a cloak?" Farid asked the group. They all nodded, some even grabbing the corners of the cloaks they wore to show him.</p>

<p>"Boots?"</p>

<p>Again, the youths showed Farid the plain but sturdy boots they all wore.</p>

<p>"Good," Farid said. "Listen to me and learn my lesson well: your cloak and boots matter more to you than this trench. If the Argivians make it through our wire, if their metal avengers lead the way, if it looks like we're going to lose this line, you grab your cloak and you grab your boots and you run." Farid kicked the bone off the planks and into the soggy mud of the trench floor. "There's always another trench. Might not always be another cloak or pair of boots." He waited until each of the boys nodded at him. "Good. Lesson over. You're dismissed."</p>

<p>The replacements shuffled away. One remained, not moving from where he stood: the old, one-eyed veteran. He leaned on his spear with the comfort of a killer.</p>

<p>"How long?" the old veteran asked.</p>

<p>"A year and some months as of the start of winter," Farid said. "Karrak here has counted three. You?"</p>

<p>"I lost my eye at the Siege of Kroog," the old veteran said. "Served in the supply corps for a year following, and then they sent me back to train new warriors."</p>

<p>"The Siege?" Farid whistled. "I was only a baby when Kroog burned." Farid waved the old veteran over to sit next to him on the fire step. "What's your name, uncle?"</p>

<p>"Aiman," the old veteran said, setting his pack down. Aiman's voice was low and soft. The old man looked around the trench line, taking it in. "The war has changed since I was last a part of it," he said. "More mud." He fixed his good eye on Farid. "You all are still children."</p>

<p>"The qadir's war," Farid said. He looked away and spat. "We all must do our part."</p>

<hr />
<p>Weeks after the arrival of the replacements, lieutenants and captains hustled up and down the trench line with trails of supply and logistics officers in tow. Grumbling and muttering quartermasters were forced to distribute tins of armor polish, new gloves, squares of cloth with which the spearmen were meant to patch their crimson cloaks, bolts of silk, and other useless things. They also doled out extra rations of nabiz and mutton that were well received by the young replacements, but who did not know what extra rations of wine and mutton meant. In the mornings, the soldiers were woken by runners and their sergeants for parade formations, ordered to line up as best one could in the narrow confines of the trench for presentations to the majors and colonels who walked with scarves held to their noses through the places where the soldiers lived.</p>

<p>Farid, Karrak, and Aiman knew this was not routine. The young, fresh replacements did not. They all thought this was a mighty refutation to Farid's chilly warnings made only days prior. Assad let Farid know as much after their section was dismissed following this morning's inspection.</p>

<p>"Not so bad, this life," Assad said, overloud, to the coterie of conscripts that followed him. "You just need to lose that city softness, you see?" He exhaled a powerful breath, sending a plume of steam roiling out into the cold morning air. He beat a fist against his firm stomach. "Carry that desert heat in your belly and love for our empire in your heart, and you'll never see a sad day in this mighty force," Assad said. "Our qadir means to set us on the attack again." He looked to Farid, smiling. "And I think everyone here should clamor to cover himself in glory after this last year of defeat. Only way to wipe away that shame is to put Tomakul to our back and send the Argivians running, right boys?"</p>

<p>A cheer went up among the replacements and—to Farid's dismay—even among some of the soldiers who had been on the line for months now. Fool's courage, second only to fear, spread quick as fevers. Only those who had been on the line for an actual attack and lived resisted the fervor.</p>

<p>Farid did not engage with Assad. He was not a fighter; besides, he had plans to make.</p>

<p>That evening, Farid, Karrak, and Aiman huddled together in a deep dugout and spoke in hurried whispers over a single low candle.</p>

<p>"Tonight, before dawn," Karrak said.</p>

<p>"Right," Farid said. "The attack is certainly coming by the end of the week. We need to go tonight."</p>

<p>"And how will they know to expect us?" Aiman asked.</p>

<p>"That I can't tell you," Farid said. "Not yet."</p>

<p>"Fine," Aiman grunted. "Whatever gets me through it, I won't complain."</p>

<p>"Good man," Farid said.</p>

<p>"If it must be tonight, then who do we trust to bring in?" Karrak, whose fever had finally broken, spoke around the warm smoke of the trenchroll he smoked. He offered it to Farid, who shook his head. Aiman plucked the roll instead.</p>

<p>"Not Assad," Aiman said. "He reminds me too much of the ones I fought with at Kroog. All muscle and no think."</p>

<p>"Jamal?" Karrak offered.</p>

<p>"Jamal could be good," Farid agreed.</p>

<p>"He's quick," Karrak said. "And quiet."</p>

<p>"No," Aiman said. "Jamal is Sarinthian. The qadir only just suppressed their rebellion," Aiman said. He shook his head. "I like Jamal, but no one outside the unit will trust him. If we get caught out there with a Sarinthian<nbsp> . . .</nbsp>" Aiman drew his thumb across his throat.</p>

<p>"Right, good point." Farid sighed. He ran a hand over his shorn head. "Damn it, Karrak. Why do we have to take someone new?"</p>

<p>Karrak shook his head. "Sergeant said we have to take someone new to make it look convincing. Says the lieutenant told him that the colonel has ordered night patrols to be teams of four." He shrugged. "If it's just the three of us, we look suspicious."</p>

<p>"Fine," Farid said. "Four it is."</p>

<p>"Ehsan," Aiman said. "Ehsan is nobody. He'll do as he's told and stay quiet after."</p>

<p>"Ehsan?" Farid looked to Karrak, who shrugged. "Perfect," Farid said. "Aiman, you go get young Ehsan."</p>

<p>Aiman nodded and touched his brow. He scooted back from the candle and pulled himself out of the dugout. Farid and Karrak listened to the sound of his boots tromping away down the trench. When they faded and they were alone, Karrak finally spoke.</p>

<p>"Can we trust Aiman?"</p>

<p>Farid looked up at the canvas flap that covered the entrance to their dugout.</p>

<p>"I trust that he wants to live," Farid said. "Same as you and me and everyone else the war didn't kill yet."</p>

<p>"Just as well," Karrak grunted in a tone Farid knew to mean agreement. "Aiman knows who the real enemy is."</p>

<p>A commotion outside broke the long silence that followed. Boots thudding past on the plank flooring of the trench, excited murmurs and cursing. A shout.</p>

<p>Karrak started to his feet, hand to the long knife at his belt. Farid darted past him, bursting out into the trench in time to collide with a group of soldiers jogging past. They all tumbled to the ground, cursing and blaming each other for their clumsiness. Trading shoves, they pulled each other to their feet and parted. Farid hollered curses at the soldiers as they hustled down the trench; they shouted curses back, but they continued down the line.</p>

<p>"What's going on?" Karrak asked, poking his head out from the dugout. Not an attack—if there was an attack, it would be much louder. This was something else.</p>

<p>"I don't know," Farid said. He stepped to the side as more soldiers jogged past. "Something down that way, maybe a fight, maybe some new war machine." Farid offered his hand down to Karrak. "You coming?"</p>

<p>Karrak laughed and ducked back inside their dugout, twitching the curtain closed behind him. A no, then. Farid buttoned his coat against the evening's chill and joined the stream of curious troopers heading down the trench, shuffling along with them through the zigs and zags and blastbreaks. Though the sun had only just set and the world above the trench still clung to the day's light, the belly of the battleworks were plunged already into deep night. The trench's lights hummed on and burned dim, banishing the umbral dark with warm, blood-red light. To Farid that light–meant to save their vision in case of a nighttime assault–always made everything seem darker. To this moment it added a special horror.</p>

<p>Muttering filtered through the close-packed soldiers ahead. A pair of troopers crouched at the lip of the trench, offering their hands down to help haul any who wanted up. Whatever drew this crowd happened behind their line; it was not the Argivians.</p>

<p>When it was Farid's turn, both soldiers hauled him up. They were silent, grim-faced, ashen. Farid did not ask questions. The last fingers of light bled below the horizon. Dozens of soldiers stood a short distance away, their breath puffing white into the deepening night sky. Red and green lights flashed and slipped through the gaps in this wall of bodies.</p>

<p>Farid went alone to join them.</p>

<p>The stink hit Farid first. Like an open latrine pit before the sanitary corps got to it, or a battlefield thick with the dead. A weight to the chilly evening air. He pushed through the crowd, which seemed more than willing to part. Some of the soldiers even turned and started back to the trench, prayers tumbling from their lips.</p>

<p>The sound of chains and marching. The crunch of frosted ground trod over by hundreds of bare feet. The dim red and green nightlights topped poles carried by their minders, marker lights that the chained creatures followed. The dead ones. Farid thought he felt the blood drain from his face. Transmogrants. Hideous, piteous things that were once human, now a rotting amalgam of flesh and machine.</p>

<p>Whispers spread through the line of onlooking soldiers as the transmogrants marched past not ten yards away. The work of Mishra's protege, these things. The fate of any who died on the line, or those who passed of illness, or those who did not want to fight when the conscription gangs came to take them.</p>

<p>The transmogrants were chained together at their ankles with some distance allowed between them, but they moved at a uniform step, more perfect than any drilled line of human soldiers Farid had seen. In the dying, light he could not make out many details of these horrors, but what he did see burned into his memory. He saw dead and graying skin, scoured from the cold and the sun, stretched and woven through dark metal. They walked without outward care of the cold. They carried no weapons, but wicked claws burst from weeping stumps. Bloodless flaps with dead tufts of hair pulled taught over polished metal domes. Chain veils hiding the ruins of faces, but not the hot breath puffing out from between the links.</p>

<p>Farid's stomach soured, but he did not retch. The horror of what he saw made sense. It was the battlefield he knew, embodied in a decaying legion of killing machines. Farid pitied the people these things had been. He pitied himself. He turned to head back. By the time he reached the trench a short distance away, officers had already begun shouting and bellowing at the soldiers to head back to their posts, lest they be volunteered for mechanical service.</p>

<p>The night was cold. Outside Farid's dugout, the trench was alive with movement. Soldiers quietly hustled by with crates of handheld bombs, replacement spearheads, bomb-lance tips, armor-piercing bolts, wire-cutters, spare powerstones, and various other ordnance.</p>

<p>An attack was coming. Farid guessed they would be ordered over the top within the week. He did not sleep, and neither did Karrak or Aiman. Instead, with Ehsan sitting confused but silent with them, the four spearmen huddled together over a dim candle and planned for a long night.</p>

<hr />
<p>Farid, Karrak, and Aiman, with Ehsan between them, moved quietly and quickly through the trench, taking care not to disturb any of the sleeping soldiers. They carried only their knives, no spears, and left their brass caps behind, favoring instead dark clothing and soft wool caps. Ehsan didn't ask any questions, though Farid could tell he had many. The boy was as quiet as Aiman promised he was, small and quick, likely no older than fourteen.</p>

<p>Farid carried one of the red-lensed nightlights. It was powered by a powerstone chip and burned dim enough not to call attention, but bright enough to dispel some of the trench's deep darkness.</p>

<p>"Wait here," Farid said, pointing the nightlight at a wooden sign. Aiman put his hands on Ehsan's shoulders to steady him—he was old enough to be the boy's grandfather, Farid thought. Karrak held a trenchroll between his lips but did not light it.</p>

<p>"Sergeant Usman," Farid whispered as he crept into this section of trench. He knocked quietly on the planks outside of each dugout, calling the sergeant's name. "Sergeant Usman, it's Farid of D Company, Third Tomakul Spears."</p>

<p>A rustle, and one of the dugout flaps flipped back. "You're late, Farid," Sergeant Usman said, crawling out from his dugout. "I expected you an hour ago." He yawned, tugged his cap down around his ears, and crossed his arms for warmth. "Where are your men?"</p>

<p>"Here," Farid said. He looked back to Karrak, Aiman, and Ehsan and waved them over. The three of them moved quietly to join them.</p>

<p>"Good, four, good," Usman said, tallying the small group. "Here, one moment." Usman whistled between his teeth, a short and clipped sound that slipped quickly away into the night. Another soldier emerged from a dugout with an armful of soft satchels. Usman took them and passed them to Farid, who handed them out one by one to his companions.</p>

<p>"One full satchel for me and my boys, remember," Usman said, wagging a finger at Farid. "Or I talk, and you join the machines."</p>

<p>"Uncle, you'll be cheering when I return," Farid said, a quick smile on his lean face. "Do you have the order chit?"</p>

<p>Usman reached into his coat and pulled out a ring of thin, tin tabs. He snapped one off and held it out to Farid.</p>

<p>"You'll need to think of an excuse for why you're late and far from your unit," Usman said. "But that chit will make your story believable to any officer that might stop you."</p>

<p>"Outstanding," Farid said, reaching for the chit. Usman did not release it.</p>

<p>"One full satchel," Usman said. "If it's not bursting at the seams—"</p>

<p>"You'll talk," Farid said. "It's not my first time, sergeant, don't worry. You'll have a full satchel by the dawn."</p>

<p>Usman released the chit. Farid pocketed it and Usman waved toward the fire step, where a ladder had been built into the trench wall. "We cut the wire this morning. Go up here and stay low. Whistle when you return."</p>

<p>"You'll hear a tune as pretty as the flowers of Tomakul," Farid said, turning from the sergeant. "Boys, let's go." Farid crossed the trench and tested the ladder. Finding it sturdy, he started to climb. Karrak followed, with Ehsan and Aiman bringing up the rear.</p>

<p>As Ehsan watched the other men's boots disappear over the lip of the trench, he hesitated. The boy looked back to Aiman, who he had followed close behind until now.</p>

<p>"Uncle," Ehsan whispered to Aiman. "Where are we going?"</p>

<p>"Quiet," Aiman whispered.</p>

<p>"Are we going to fight?"</p>

<p>"No," Aiman said. "Now, up over the top—and be quick, we don't want any officers to see us," he said. He gave Ehsan a soft push, encouraging him to climb. "I'll be right behind you."</p>

<p>War had ruined Farid's faith, but he still regarded the world above the trench as hell. It was a place out of balance. Paradise was all things distributed in harmony and proper apportionment: the balances of stone, fire, sky, and water, imbued in one's body and soul, in the land and in dreams.</p>

<p>No-man's-land then was the opposite, a crucible into which people were fed and ghosts emerged. It was a hell of the body, the soul, dreams, and the land. It was colder up here than in the trenches: Every surface was exposed to the bitter valley wind and watching eyes of soldiers on both sides. Nothing remained of the forest that once filled this valley. The trees that hadn't been harvested before this valley became a battlefield were now cinder-blackened stumps. The river that once coursed here had been dammed somewhere near Tomakul to deny the Argivians any of its bounty. Of the towns that once dotted the valley, only a single low, ragged stone wall remained. It was a landmark to the soldiers: how far from the wall has one moved in a year? How close to it?</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align:right;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/GbVYQSv9bR.jpg" /><p class="embedImageCaption">Art by: <a href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&amp;output=spoiler&amp;method=visual&amp;artist=+[%22Sergey%20Glushakov%22]" target="_blank">Sergey Glushakov</a></p></div></div>

<p>Farid led his small group across this alien landscape, moving as quickly and quietly as he could while scurrying, belly low to the ground, guiding his party around the worst of the dead and the craters flooded with sour water. One crossed this hellscape by scrambling between craters and along old and decaying plank walkways, laid by advancing forces in long-forgotten attacks. One plankway had its builders' corpses rotting alongside, festooned with order chits dropped upon them by soldiers from both sides, grateful for their sacrifice in making this place more navigable.</p>

<p>They reached their first landmark without incident: a downed bomber thopter, a heavy Argivian flying craft that resembled a fat-bellied bird. The four of them crawled inside through a rent in its thin metal fuselage.</p>

<p>"Damned cough," Karrak said. He wheezed, struggling to breathe.</p>

<p>"Take a moment," Farid said. "All of you, take a moment to rest here."</p>

<p>"Like a wanderer gull," Aiman said, peering through the dusty glass of the thopter's crew compartment. "Great big birds that would soar alongside my father's ship." He spoke out loud, but to Farid it seemed as if he talked to only himself. Aiman looked through the wreckage toward the Argivian lines. "I never saw them land. I never thought they could."</p>

<p>"Where are we?" Ehsan said. His voice was still high and soft, very much a child's.</p>

<p>"Lower than the Nine Hells," Karrak grumbled. He set his heavy pack down on the damp floor of the thopter, groaning in relief at the weight off his shoulders. One hand rubbing his throat, he clambered over to Aiman and tapped him on the shoulder. "Let me look."</p>

<p>Farid offered Ehsan a sip of his water. The boy took it, drank, and passed it back.</p>

<p>"About fifty yards that way—where Aiman and Karrak are looking—is the Argivian line," Farid said.</p>

<p>Ehsan looked bug-eyed toward the enemy lines.</p>

<p>"Don't worry," Farid said. "We're not going to attack"—he indicated the packs Karrak and Aiman carried—"We're going to trade. All we have to do is hang this flag here," he said as he pulled a short bolt of white cloth out from a pocket on his coat. "And wait."</p>

<p>"I don't think I've ever seen an Argivian before," Ehsan said. "I was wondering how I'd kill one without a spear—the officers said they're made out of metal, and all I have is this little knife."</p>

<p>"It's not the people you gotta worry about," Karrak said.</p>

<p>"They die quick as cut flowers," Aiman said, agreeing. "Same as us."</p>

<p>"We're not going to kill anyone," Farid said, quieting the group. "You can keep that knife hidden away, Ehsan. You won't need it, unless it is to cut chocolate or sausage."</p>

<p>Ehsan smiled at the mention of chocolate. Farid could tell it had been a long time since Ehsan last smiled. For that matter, it had been a long time since Farid had smiled. It took humanity to smile and mean it, and Farid had none. This was not a condemnation; it was an admission, a necessary act of survival. Tunnel your vision to the task at hand and survive.</p>

<p>Farid, quickly, hung the strip of cloth on the outside of the crashed thopter, facing the Argivian trenches. Then, they settled in to wait.</p>

<p>The cold pre-dawn night was endless, stretching across this blasted valley from Tomakul to Kroog and beyond. It wormed into the hearts and desires of every bejeweled lord and power-hungry emperor, flooded their eyes like blood in milk. Eager, they reared up and sent a million of their children to fuel the night's appetite, which was now indistinguishable from their own.</p>

<p>Farid was only one of millions. The princes of the world would see Ehsan's soul added to the butcher's tally and, unmoved, call for a million more.</p>

<p>He looked to Ehsan, reached out, and patted his cheek.</p>

<p>"You don't need to worry," he said. "You'll be fine."</p>

<p>And then an explosion boomed somewhere in the distance, followed by a series of sharp pops and long, sizzling whines. Spotting flares launched from both sides illuminated a section of trench and no-man's-land a mile and a half down the line, far enough that the light from the flares' ignition flashed a heartbeat before the sound of their detonation. They could hear the echoes of distant screams somewhere down the valley but could not tell whose side cried out.</p>

<p>"Down," Farid hissed. He waved his palm down and put a finger to his lips. "Down, now!"</p>

<p>The four of them dropped to the shadowed belly of the crashed thopter, hands over their heads, and waited. The harsh, steady light of the parachuting flares cast stark and nightmarish shadows through the cracked and dirty glass of the ornithopter's crew compartment and bombing windows. That light was unrelenting, white and furious, the gaze of a god who only knew fire.</p>

<p>The thunder quieted. Not a battle, just a fight of no consequence. Farid let out a long and trembling exhale. He counted as the light from the flares faded and night returned.</p>

<p>"They're coming," Aiman said. He peered through the thopter's dusty glass canopy. "I see four of them at least, thirty yards distant."</p>

<p>"Just them, right?" Karrak asked. "No avengers? No walkers?"</p>

<p>"Just them," Aiman said. "Farid?"</p>

<p>Farid looked over to Ehsan, who had crawled into a corner, pale-faced and trembling. His hopeful smile gone. The boy knew he would never be fine. Even if by some grace Farid could resurrect this ornithopter and fly it home, Ehsan would never be a child again. None of them could steal back what had been ripped from them. It was easy to become one of the next million, harder to resist the momentum of lords and emperors. Unless—</p>

<p>"Karrak," Farid said. "Go greet our friends."</p>

<hr />
<p>The Argivians spoke some Fallaji, and likewise Farid, Karrak, and Aiman had some Argivian. Four Argivians clambered into the wreck of the bomber. One of them produced a canteen filled with some acrid spirit, Karrak broke out his trenchrolls, and the soldiers got to talking, joking, and swapping small things. Though hesitant at first, Ehsan soon joined the rest of them, and the eight soldiers together made a warm escape from the war. In the wreckage of the downed ornithopter, this small group may as well have been comfortable acquaintances at a cafe in Tomakul or a tea shop in Argive; if Farid closed his eyes, he could almost imagine a world outside of this one.</p>

<p>"I want to apologize for being late," the Argivian leader said in lightly accented Fallaji. She was a windbitten woman who reminded Farid of his mother. Stern, but he could see the laugh lines worn into her face. Laria, Farid remembered her name.</p>

<p>"Crossing our line was difficult," Laria said. "Lots of officers. Many new ones." She pointed to her eyes, and then to her group. "They don't trust us, so they watch."</p>

<p>Karrak grunted. "Sounds like officers," he said, speaking his own rough Argivian. "Always looking to use their swords."</p>

<p>The Argivians chuckled. Laria smiled. She looked past Farid and Karrak to Aiman and Ehsan, who, though part of the group, had kept quiet. "And who are they?"</p>

<p>"This is Ehsan," Aiman said, speaking before Farid could. The old man's Argivian, though accented, was perfect; he spoke with the comfort of one who had heard a language young and grown up with it close. "He's new on the line, from Tomakul. My name is Aiman. I am not new to the line, though I thought myself retired from the war many years ago after I was wounded."</p>

<p>"You speak our language well," Laria said. She switched to Argivian and introduced herself. Farid only caught a few words as she and Aiman carried on a rapid, gregarious conversation. Farid watched the two of them talk and felt a distant sort of hope. Aiman, like Ehsan, could still spark into the person he was before the war—the only difference was he had been through it before. The old man had been shoved into hell, all but torn to ribbons by the death machines there, and still knew how to make someone laugh. His smile was not sweet; many of his teeth were missing and the scars that webbed out from his ruined eye tugged at the corner of his mouth. But it was a beautiful smile. Laria's quiet laughter was the sound of Farid's sisters and mother, kneading dough.</p>

<p>This moment was good. The war didn't make this moment happen; it happened despite the war. Farid looked from Aiman's broken smile to Laria's graying hair, Karrak's gaunt face to the bandaged brow of the Argivian soldier he compared and traded knives with. Farid was not a poet, but the beauty of this moment sat with him. He committed to memory the tragedy of this little peace: their blood was the ink in which lord and emperors rewrote the borders of the world.</p>

<p>"It's nearing dawn," Laria said after some kind hours passed. The eight of them were well comfortable now, their helms discarded and packs piled, laden with the goods they all brought to trade. "We should get back."</p>

<p><em>Now</em>, Farid thought. The mighty could not write without ink; rob them of their medium. "There is an attack coming," Farid said. "Our officers have been preparing an assault. The whole front."</p>

<p>Laria raised an eyebrow. She looked to her soldiers, who paused as they adjusted their packs.</p>

<p>"Farid," Karrak said, speaking Fallaji. "This could get us killed."</p>

<p>"Quiet," Farid snapped.</p>

<p>Karrak quieted, glowering. Farid ignored him and continued, switching back to Argivian.</p>

<p>"Our generals have moved in a whole regiment of transmogrants—the qadir's dead men," Farid said. "Those silks and kits we gave you? They passed them out to us just days ago. They've given us wine and meat. Brought in thousands of replacements from across the Empire," he said, gesturing to Aiman and Ehsan.</p>

<p>Laria nodded. Any soldier this long on the line knew what extra rations and troop movements meant. "Thank you, Farid," she said. She looked to Aiman and spoke to him in Argivian, far too fast for Farid to understand. Aiman responded, Laria smiled, and with a salute, she and her troops left the ornithopter.</p>

<p>"What did she say?" Farid asked Aiman.</p>

<p>"Clay statues," Aiman said.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Their general," Aiman said. "A man named Tawnos. He's an artificer in service to their Lord Urza. He has brought with him a dozen units of his Clay Soldiers." Aiman nodded toward the Argivian line. "Laria said they know our attack is coming. They've been preparing for weeks. It's going to be a slaughter on both sides," Aiman said. "But if we stay back, she said, it will only be a slaughter of machines."</p>

<p>Farid exhaled. He had been holding his breath the whole time without realizing it. He looked at Karrak, who was pale.</p>

<p>"We have to keep this to ourselves," Karrak said. He looked at Aiman and Ehsan. "We can't tell anyone."</p>

<p>"I know," Farid said.</p>

<p>"If anyone else discovers that we know this," Karrak whispered, "we'll be hung as traitors if we don't die first."</p>

<p>"Yeah," Farid nodded. He closed his eyes and sighed. Pinched his brow. "Fine. We keep this between us, agreed?"</p>

<p>"Aye," Aiman said. He muttered a quick prayer.</p>

<p>"Agreed," Karrak said.</p>

<p>Ehsan said nothing but nodded.</p>

<p>"Good," Farid said. It was far from good, but it was enough.</p>

<p>As they crawled, silent and burdened, through the cold mud back to their trench, Farid wrestled with hope. What other choice do the disposable people of the world have? The men above them had weapons, gold, blessings from the gods—all that Farid had was his body. All he could do was refuse to be ink and try to save the ones that could still be pulled out from the night.</p>

<p>The order to attack came two days later.</p>

<hr />
<p>The officer's whistles thrust the cold morning into blinkered clarity. One purpose now: survive and advance. Farid flinched as another barrage of energy beams and shells rumbled overhead, whistling and screaming through the sky. The earth shook, his heart pounded against his cuirass.</p>

<p>The first wave had already gone over the top, only a handful from Farid's section tumbling back into the trench, feathered with bolts. The second wave stood ready on the fire step; Farid, Karrak, Aiman, and Ehsan stood in the final wave of the day, shoulder to shoulder with the other soldiers of D Company, Third Tomakul Spears. Stinking fear and shallow breath fogged the air above them. Someone retched, as someone always does. Farid's leg could not stop shaking.</p>

<p>A sound like thunder rumbled overhead, constant and bone-rattling. Heavy bomb-lobbers, catapulting shells overhead from somewhere well behind the line. Farid had seen those machines before: they looked to him like beetles with smokestacks bristling from their backs—cannons, the engineers and artificers called them. They had been firing for the better part of an hour now, pounding the Argivian line with explosions and shrapnel. Acrid smoke drifted back. Though he could not see from inside the trench, Farid could smell the raging, terrible fire. They would continue that bombardment until the first wave was nearly upon the Argivian lines.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align:right;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/IRQ94zAKWf.jpg" /><p class="embedImageCaption">Art by: <a href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&amp;output=spoiler&amp;method=visual&amp;artist=+[%22Campbell%20White%22]" target="_blank">Campbell White</a></p></div></div>

<p>An officer stood directly behind Farid, sword drawn, and bellowed about glory and honor and driving the Argivian dogs back to the Mardun. He promised the first soldier of his company to reach the Argivian trench a sack of gold coins, a commendation to any who captured an Argivian flag. If any cowards remained behind, he promised to have them taste Tomakul steel.</p>

<p>D Company's lives were packed onto their backs. If this attack was successful—which the officers demanded and assured them it would be—then they would move into the cleared-out trench. If they died, then it was easy for the quartermasters and supply officers to collect. D Company wore their coats, their long knives, brass caps if they had them or soft campaign covers if they did not. They carried their short spears and bandoliers of extra bomb-tipped heads, clubs, trench nails. Anything to make them better killers.</p>

<p>The bomb-lobbers fell silent, the last reports of shells echoing away down the valley.</p>

<p>Another whistle. The barking of sergeants and hollering of officers drove the second wave up from the fire step, up over the ladders, up over the lip of the trench and into the swirling smoke. No land beyond the lip of the trench, Farid thought as he stepped up to the fire step. He cheered along with the rest of the men, cheered until his throat hurt so the officers would not turn on him. Aiman bellowed, Ehsan's voice cracked and wobbled. Karrak cursed over and over.</p>

<p>They were next.</p>

<p>"What do we do?" Ehsan looked up at Farid, clutching his spear in a white-knuckled grip.</p>

<p>"We go slow," Farid whispered. It wasn't safe to talk here. "Stay with me. Be my shadow. Don't go anywhere I don't go. If I die, look for Karrak or Aiman." Farid looked down at Ehsan. "If you can't find any of us, get down and stay down until night. Don't fight, just stay alive."</p>

<p>Ehsan nodded. He shuffled closer to Farid, who put an arm around his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Ready up, spearman!" The officer behind them shouted, slapping Farid's arm with the flat of his sword. Farid cursed and removed his arm from Ehsan's shoulder.</p>

<p>Shouts up and down the line. Runners hurrying with last-second orders. Officers clenched whistles between their teeth but did not blow, reading the small scrolls.</p>

<p>The wind changed. The rotten stink of decay washed over the trench from behind as the officers shouted at their soldiers to pull up their masks. Farid and the rest of the company tugged their muslin masks from their pouches and tied them on. The fabric was soft and did little to banish the eye-watering stink of the transmogrants. Freed of their chains, they trod in shuffling lockstep over narrow plank bridges laid across the trench. But for the sound of their bare flesh-and-metal feet thudding on the wood or squelching in the cold mud, they were quiet.</p>

<p>Farid, thankfully, was not under one of the bridges. He hazarded a look over to the nearest crossing and watched in horror as the transmogrants advanced; though mass-produced in some charnel factory, each one seemed a unique body, a one-off marriage of dead flesh and iron. They were each a nightmare.</p>

<p>Farid tugged his cloth mask tighter and set his eyes straight to the ladder in front of him. When the whistle blew, he climbed, pushed along by those behind him. Near the top of the ladder, he reached up and took Karrak's hand, pulling himself up over the lip of the trench. He turned and helped Ehsan up, and then left the officer behind to fend for himself.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align:right;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/QC9b36B3Z3.jpg" /><p class="embedImageCaption">Art by: <a href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&amp;output=spoiler&amp;method=visual&amp;artist=+[%22Daarken%22]" target="_blank">Daarken</a></p></div></div>

<p>The charge was slow despite the screaming of the officers' whistles and hoarse cry from the third wave. Smoke drifted over everything, shrinking their world down to a hazy ring a dozen yards in diameter. Farid, Aiman, Karrak, and Ehsan moved slowly forward, spears level, spaced only a few feet apart, marching rather than running toward the Argivian line. A dozen or so spearmen walked in rank alongside them, vanishing into the smoke on either side. An officer walked behind them, sword drawn.</p>

<p>"Steady boys," Farid said. "Steady. Watch your footing." A hot rain fell, mud and water tumbling down from the morning's mighty bombardment. Here and there, they came across the fallen bodies of their comrades, torn and burned. Casualties of the shells that missed their mark and fell among their own ranks.</p>

<p>The charge across no-man's-land was a slow tumbling of balance and recovery. They slipped and slid across muddy craters and used their spears as walking sticks. Shouts rang up and down the line, drifting in from the smoke along the advance. Together they crossed the crater field and passed by the ruined ornithopter. Ahead it was quiet, without the usual sound of battle. No cries of pain or fear, no shouts, no clash of metal on metal, no great booms and reports of bombs or the massive weapons of the machines. Just the crackle of fire, the soft rattling of their equipment, and the quiet encouragement of the officers behind.</p>

<p>They reached the Argivian trench and found it empty. Their bombardment had been effective and terrible, churning the well-engineered battlements into a mess of wire, burning wood, and abandoned equipment. Some lightly wounded Fallaji soldiers of the first and second wave sat smoking or resting on captured crates of Argivian equipment. They greeted the third wave with exhausted nods and sardonic cheers.</p>

<p>"Where are the Argivians?" a lieutenant screamed at the wounded soldiers. "Where is the enemy?"</p>

<p>"Front's moved," a wounded corporal said. She thumbed over her shoulder, down the valley toward the distant Mardun. "Rest of the Third went on to the next trench. Looks like the Argivians are running back to Kroog."</p>

<p>The officer stamped and fumed, then ordered D Company to check the trench while he went to find out what he should do. Farid, Karrak, Aiman, and Ehsan went together, the four of them wandering off into a section of the trench that was largely intact.</p>

<p>They found it to be a mirror of their own. Dugouts and small chambers for soldiers to crouch and sleep in. Empty racks where they would have kept weapons stowed for quick access should an attack come. Plenty of small things left behind in the hurry to escape. Not a single soul remained. Farid and Ehsan found a transmogrant that had tumbled into the trench and snapped in half. Farid stabbed it with his spear, thinking to put the beast out of its misery, but it only grabbed the weapon and turned its eyeless gaze to him. Farid released his spear and staggered back. The transmogrant shuddered, as if trying to stand, but made no sound. Aiman pulled Ehsan from the transmogrant, wordlessly steering him away before the boy could try to use his own spear on the fallen creature.</p>

<p>"Hey, Farid," Karrak called. He stood halfway in a dugout, spear tucked under his arm. "Look what I found." He held up a small packet of paper wrapping, secured with a shred of familiar fabric. Farid walked over and saw it was a strip of Fallaji silk–one of the sashes they'd traded with Laria and her soldiers.</p>

<p>"What is it?" Farid asked.</p>

<p>"No clue." Karrak said, offering it to him.</p>

<p>Farid took the packet. For a moment, he worried it was a trap, but that moment passed. Karrak, Aiman, and Ehsan crowded him, curious. Farid tugged the silk free, stuffed it in his pocket, and unwrapped the contents, revealing a small piece of chocolate and a note.</p>

<p><em>Our gratitude</em>, written in Fallaji script by an Argivian hand.</p>

<p>Farid smiled. A small and human thing. Ink, blotting the page.</p>

<p>The officers' whistles started up again. Forward, the order.</p>

<p>Eleven miles from the golden domes of Tomakul, the front was on the move once more.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>44 AR</strong></p>

<p>Teferi appeared at night in a place very much like hell. Fire burned low on all sides of the spot where he snapped into coherence. He was grateful that as a spirit he could not smell what he saw: The dead were so closely packed that in some places there was no visible ground, only bodies atop bodies. Ruined machines ticked and cooled. Earthworks, once mighty testaments to engineering and human brilliance, were empty and abandoned. A battlefield at night, after some bloody price paid. Teferi looked around, grim-faced, and tried to get his bearings; the last two jumps had rattled him.</p>

<p>The Last Battle took place on Argoth, an island shattered and buried by the sylex blast. Histories recorded by survivors elsewhere on Terisiare spoke of it as a verdant jewel, the last green place where the brothers fought. This place was not that. A bit of wall stood alone in a valley stripped of trees and greenery, boiled to mud and crisscrossed by wire-bordered trenches. Fires burned on what surface it could eat. Not Argoth; likely somewhere on the mainland.</p>

<p>The knot of time around the Last Battle was a confusing morass of recursive loops, potentialities, and branching paths. Navigating them, even with the aid of Saheeli's brilliant Temporal Anchor, was a nightmare. Or Teferi thought it was, until he realigned here on this battlefield. This was the true nightmare. Worse even than the burning streets of Kroog. He'd returned shaken from that experience, but time—even for him, and even with the anchor at his disposal—was running out. He had to return, quickly.</p>

<p>Teferi guessed and, against Kaya and Saheeli's protestations, had engaged the anchor once more, seeking the Last Battle in the manifold mess of time that was the Brothers' War. On paper his search was simple enough: find what he came to think of as "blotted time," where tens of thousands of lives met and came to an end. Blotted time looked to Teferi like holes chewed in a hanging curtain, or stars in the night sky. Its cause was great death—the infinite possibilities of all those lives ending in a moment, taking with them a piece of the great tapestry of time.</p>

<p>Time was running out; the moment Teferi sought was difficult to find. He was only one observer; he was not a god. All other possibilities were slipping away from him.</p>

<p>What did he know of the Last Battle? Urza brought a colossus of stone and iron, and it fought a titan of wood and resin and the dead of Argoth. Then Urza and the sylex killed the world.</p>

<p>Teferi glided over the ground, giving himself a few minutes before heading back and trying again. He didn't see a stone colossus or a titanic forest creature, like Kayla's poem mentioned. There was no ocean. Only mud and the dead.</p>

<p>And the scavengers.</p>

<p>Teferi didn't see them when he first arrived, but he saw them now. Lone figures stalked across the field, bending every now and then to examine a body. Alone or in small groups, they dragged bodies behind them, stacking them on carts that others wheeled off into the night. Some collected the ruined parts of fallen automatons, prying powerstones from sockets and working joints from shattered bodies.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align:right;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/OzzwE1BbUh.jpg" /><p class="embedImageCaption">Art by: <a href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&amp;output=spoiler&amp;method=visual&amp;artist=+[%22Peter%20Polach%22]" target="_blank">Peter Polach</a></p></div></div>

<p>"Who are you?"</p>

<p>If Teferi had blood, it would have run cold. He turned, slowly, and looked into the hideously augmented face of one of the black-robed scavengers.</p>

<p>"Are you the one from our dream?" the person whispered. They stepped forward, a deep whirring and clicking issuing from them. Their eyes were black chips of glass set deep into puffy, red sockets. Their mouth was lipless, toothless, replaced with a studded, tumbling cylinder that clicked thin metal strips as it turned. The sound was flat, soft, and hideous.</p>

<p>They did not seem to be in pain. Instead, it looked as if they were smiling.</p>

<p>Teferi drifted backwards, avoiding the scavenger as they reached toward him. The hem of their sleeve fell away, revealing an arm that ended in a cluster of dozens of small grasping manipulators.</p>

<p>"Brothers," the scavenger screamed. "Do you see him?"</p>

<p>Teferi had seen enough. This was not the Last Battle, only a footnote lost in the great void on time's tapestry that was the Brothers' War.</p>

<p>It was time to go.</p>

<p>Kroog died on a crimson morning.</p>

<p>To Sanwell, it sounded like a festival day, only the crowds cheered in a minor key, and the booms and reports were not fireworks exploding, and the smoke rising over the city stank of burning industry and steaming bricks.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align:right;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/pbtfCcpblX.jpg" />

<p>The orniary's main yard was abuzz with activity. Technicians and artificers sprinted back and forth hauling anti-armor bolts, powerstones, and avenger swords. Stompers and other autonomous units waited in ready ranks, crowding the plaza. Piles of ammunition, spare parts, and other material stood in hasty stacks. The five student pilots and their instructor stood in front of the canvas-covered supplies, facing a rank of old, refurbished avengers.</p>

<p>The morning sun hung low and hot in the sky, burning away the rest of the night's blood-warm rain. Sanwell, at attention, swayed, lightheaded. His stomach lurched, and he retched on the hot brick between his boots.</p>

<p>"Pilot Sanwell, you will tighten up your constitution," Llora shouted. The cadets' instructor was red-faced and stern, dressed in a crisp and clean uniform despite the early hour and hurried muster.</p>

<p>"Sorry, ma'am," Sanwell said. He spat the last of his sick out onto the hot stone plaza and wiped the back of his hand across his mouth. He had nothing to cough up but water and nerves; the attack had come before breakfast.</p>

<p>"You good, San?" Rica muttered.</p>

<p>Sanwell's face burned with embarrassment. Rica stood unwavering at his side, as stoic as if he was carved from the red brick of Kroog itself.</p>

<p>"Fine," Sanwell said. He wanted to die. "I think I had something sour last night."</p>

<p>Rica did not answer. The warning bells of Kroog rang out across the city. The sound churned Sanwell's stomach almost as much as Rica's stiff non-acknowledgement.</p>

<p>"I'm worried about my brother," Sanwell said. "Rendall is in the capital proper—he's a flyer, he's not cut out for fighting."</p>

<p>"Eyes forward!" Llora barked, interrupting Sanwell's one-sided conversation with Rica. The old Suwwardi paced before the short line of avenger trainees, staring at each one in turn. The woman was tough as new leather and harsh as the lime that cured it, thin as a reed and sharp as needle.</p>

<p>Sanwell felt faint. He was dipping into metaphor, he realized, to get away from the moment.</p>

<p>"You five cadets," Llora began, "have the honor of being the only ground-pounders in the city capable of crewing an avenger while keeping your head on your shoulders." Llora pointed to the ground beneath her boots. "You are being called up, boys. Training is over. Today's the day you save Kroog."</p>

<p>Sanwell looked between his own boots at the crimson bricks, neatly laid in spiraling star patterns. That had taken some getting used to for Sanwell—the Yotians decorated everything. It meant everything from cooking to construction took a little bit longer, but to young Sanwell that was worth it. In Kroog, as in much of Yotia, even the streets were art. Unlike the stoic blocks of his native Penregon, Sanwell could walk with his head low or eyes up, and either way, he would find a little majesty. It was as a city should be, Sanwell came to think: full of little wonders, plainly hidden delights, all watched over by mighty triumphs.</p>

<p>Was he ready to fight to defend it?</p>

<p>Not a theoretical question. Llora had just leaned in, face to face, to ask him.</p>

<p>Sanwell blinked and wavered.</p>

<p>"I said," Llora growled, "are you ready to fight for Kroog?"</p>

<p>"Uh, yes, I am," Sanwell said.</p>

<p>"Yes, <em>ma'am</em>," Llora corrected Sanwell. "You're on the line now, Sanwell. No more training, no more practice. You ready to fight?"</p>

<p>"Yes ma'am," Sanwell said, louder.</p>

<p>Llora nodded. "Show me," she said. She pressed a slim device into Sanwell's hand and stepped back. The four other students—<em>pilots</em>, Sanwell corrected. <em>Mentality. Change your mind, change reality. You're a pilot now</em>—the four other pilots walked to Llora, taking up relaxed but attentive positions behind the instructor.</p>

<p>Sanwell took the handheld device—a command rod, but a new model—and checked it. It was the length of his forearm, etched on one end for grip, tapered ever so slightly at the smooth opposite end. A small, tactile switch rested under his thumb when he held the rod. Sanwell thumbed the rod on, and a soft hum warmed the tool. A toggle and a trigger rested under his pointer and ring fingers; more controls. Sanwell flipped the toggle and listened to the slight change in the rod's pitch. He pointed the rod at his hand, pulled the trigger, and saw the brief flash of light on his palm.</p>

<p>"Check," Sanwell said. He raised the command rod. Stopped. "Uh, ma'am," he said to Llora. "Which unit am I paired to?"</p>

<p>Llora pointed with her chin. "That one," she said.</p>

<p>Sanwell turned. His jaw dropped.</p>

<p>A new, shining avenger, one of the sword-pattern prototypes, still curled on its transport sledge. Sanwell had only seen the plans for them, passed around the mess during meals. They were larger, lighter, faster, more powerful—unkillable, the artificers bragged. The best they've made to date.</p>

<p>Behind this avenger waited four more. Technicians and artificers hurried to clear the packing debris—straw, canvas sheathes, leather pads, and protective oils—from the waiting machines, preparing them for activation.</p>

<p>Sanwell grinned, nerves momentarily suppressed by excitement.</p>

<p>"You'll find these sword patterns much more intuitive than the units you've been training with—even for prototypes." Llora said. Sanwell thought he could hear the pride in his instructor's voice.</p>

<p>"What's its name?" Sanwell asked Llora.</p>

<p>"Sword One," Llora said.</p>

<p>Sanwell raised his command rod and clicked the transmit button. The rod pitched up.</p>

<p>"Sword One, at attention!"</p>

<p>Sword One unfolded, standing from its sledge. The machine was humanoid, around fifteen feet tall at the shoulder. The prototype avenger looked to Sanwell like a lithe knight animated by magic fire: a mirror-polished cuirass covered its central power core, exhaust apertures fluttering, venting excess heat from its thoracic powerplant. The roar of its power core sent a rush through Sanwell. This was <em>power</em>, and it awaited his command.</p>

<p>"Sword One," Sanwell spoke firm and clear, as he had been trained. The command rods themselves were little wonders, able to pick out its operator's voice through the chaos of battle or a crowd. "At the ready!"</p>

<p>The avenger moved in a fluid, silent twist to a low ready stance, positioning one manipulator on the hilt of its primary blade, the other out for balance. Sanwell rocked backward, hair tousled by the rush of air displaced by the speed of Sword One's maneuver.</p>

<p>"Sword One, draw and guard!"</p>

<p>Sword One drew its primary blade, whipping it into a medium guard, one manipulator on the blade shaft to guide it and stabilize against incoming attacks. The blade was larger than a person, eight feet long and a foot wide at the base. Like its cuirass, it was polished to a mirror shine and caught the sun, flashing as it moved.</p>

<p>Sanwell could not suppress his excitement. With one of these, they could turn the tide. With <em>five</em>? He raised the rod one last time.</p>

<p>"Sword One," Sanwell commanded. "To me!"</p>

<p>The avenger darted toward Sanwell, stopping in a defensive crouch above him, sword at the ready.</p>

<p>"Good work, Sanwell." A different speaker.</p>

<p>Sanwell turned and saw Tawnos, Urza's chief apprentice, standing with Llora and the other pilots.</p>

<p>"Sir," Sanwell saluted. He double keyed the command rod and, as with the older stompers, Sword One dropped its defensive stance, resting at ease.</p>

<p>"I see you're acquainted with our new model already," Tawnos said. He spoke with a smile, though Sanwell read through the chief apprentice's brave face.</p>

<p>"It's a dream, Chief," Sanwell said. "Movement fidelity feels one to one—how did Urza do it?"</p>

<p>"Later, son," Tawnos said. He was breathless, as if he had just stopped from a run.</p>

<p>Sanwell realized that was probably the case: the cause for this promotion was not a happy one. Kroog was under attack. He walked over to the group of students and fell in line with them.</p>

<p>"You five are the best of our student corps," Tawnos said, addressing Sanwell, Rica, and the others. "Llora here has told me that each of you possess the skills, temperament, and cleverness necessary to command our sword-pattern avengers, and so it is with great pride that I hereby, officially, promote you to full pilots."</p>

<p>The cadets looked to each other with excitement over having their promotions confirmed—and by Urza's own assistant, no less!</p>

<p>"We can't go through the usual ceremony right now, nor can we bother with unit placement," Tawnos said. He hunched slightly as he spoke, apologetic, a stiff formality about his presentation. He really meant it, Sanwell thought, he really was sorry there could not be any ceremony about the day. Sanwell's heart swelled—Urza may have been the brilliant one, but Tawnos was nearly as smart, and he cared. That made all the difference.</p>

<p>"Kroog is under attack," Tawnos said. "The first waves of Mishra's force have crossed the Mardun; they control the River Wards. The spearhead of their attack is a detachment of dragon engines—large automatons capable of breathing fire. We believe them to be unpiloted."</p>

<p>The students—pilots, Sanwell reminded himself, for <em>real</em> this time—exchanged worried looks. Rica, Sanwell knew, was Yotian, and so was Carlo, who was from Kroog's River Wards. Sanwell looked to Carlo and saw he had paled, a bloodless look of fear and worry falling over him. Sanwell put a hand on his back, hoping to steady him.</p>

<p>"Thanks," Carlo said, quietly.</p>

<p>"The city guard and Kroog's garrison have drawn a defensive line around the capital district," Tawnos continued. "Evacuations of the other districts are underway."</p>

<p>"Does that mean we've given up the city?" Carlo said, voice wavering. "What about the River Wards?"</p>

<p>"It means we're defending what we can hold," Tawnos said, ignoring Carlo's second question. "But standing in one place isn't going to win us the day, which is where you and your new avengers come in: we're going to mount a counterattack to buy the evacuations more time." Tawnos motioned to Llora, who hefted a long crate into the middle of the group. She levered the crate open, revealing four command rods packed in straw.</p>

<p>"Each of you take one and pair up," Llora said. "Sanwell, you stick with Sword One." She passed Sanwell an empty holster.</p>

<p>"We need you and your avengers to take down the dragon engines," Tawnos said. "Once the engines are down, we stand a chance to drive Mishra's forces back."</p>

<p>Sanwell listened to Tawnos's briefing as he belted the holster on. The command rod fit snugly in the leather scabbard. That moment made <em>this</em> moment real, Sanwell realized. He looked to the other cadets—<em>pilots</em>—and watched them pair up with their avengers. Rica took Two, Carlo paired with Three. The others were cadets from a different year, the one just after Sanwell's, and unfamiliar to him. They paired with Four and Five.</p>

<p>"Good," Tawnos said when all the pilots were paired. "I have to go, but I've given instructions here to Llora for your deployment." He looked to the five pilots, hesitating. "We'll have soldiers escort you, so don't worry about being exposed to the fighting," Tawnos said. His voice was hoarse, as if he had been shouting, even though all he did was talk. "With these avengers, visual range will do—anything you say into the command rod, they'll be able to pick up. Don't get too close, aim with the rod, and remember to stay behind your escorts. Good luck, cadets—" Tawnos said. "Pilots," he corrected. "Good luck, pilots. Stay safe, and if you're in danger—don't think, just run. Hench, in the east, is where I have been told the army will gather."</p>

<p>Tawnos's face was a pale mask, graying as if wounded. Sanwell searched for the optimism that usually animated Tawnos but did not find it. A bolt of worry bittered his gut: Tawnos was afraid. Calm and steady Tawnos, the one who came to mess and laughed with the cadets, was afraid. He couldn't even look at them. Worry curdled to fear, a little fear that gnawed at him. How bad was it out there, really? A sudden snap of adrenaline, and Sanwell flinched, moving to raise his hand as if he were still in class.</p>

<p>"Master Tawnos, sir?" Sanwell asked. "My younger brother, Rendall—he's a cadet in the ornithopter corps, stationed at the palace."</p>

<p>"Rendall," Tawnos said, frowning. "I might know him, but don't worry—all of our thopters are deployed with Urza's forces elsewhere or about to depart," Tawnos said. "If he's in the thopter corps, he'll be out of here soon enough."</p>

<p>Sanwell exhaled a long breath he hadn't realized he was holding. He did not have time to thank Tawnos, though, as a sudden and tremendous explosion roared up on the far side of the city along the Mardun, where the fighting was heaviest.</p>

<p>The commotion in the orniary yard stopped as everyone turned to look, even Tawnos and Llora, at the distant calamity.</p>

<p>Roiling crimson smoke leapt into the sky. A whole block of the city rippled with fire. Sanwell could see a darker shape moving in the center of that rising blaze, a conflagration so great that flames swallowed the tops of the belltowers that remained standing. They crumbled as the dark shape moved and another roar split the sky, a gout of smoke and fire lancing through the blocks along the Mardun.</p>

<p>A dragon engine.</p>

<p>Tawnos cursed. He pressed a small order scroll into Llora's hands, with instructions to give them to the captain at their post. He left the yard with a quick salute to the pilots, hurrying just short of running.</p>

<p>"Right," Llora said, watching him go. "Let's get moving—double quick, avengers online and vigilant." Sanwell noticed that Llora had belted on a sword at some point during Tawnos's briefing.</p>

<p>As a unit, the five pilots and their avengers filed out of the yard. Sanwell looked back over his shoulder as they departed; behind, crews hurried to repurpose the transport sledges to haul any goods, materials, chassis, and supplies they could fit. They were preparing to evacuate the orniary.</p>

<p>A shout from Llora. Sanwell was falling behind.</p>

<p>"With me, One," Sanwell said to his avenger. Together, the two of them hurried to catch up with the rest of the pilots as they moved down into the city.</p>

<hr />
<p>Kroog was burning, and people choked her streets, fleeing the fire. Sanwell couldn't stop thinking about festival days, where competing parades to the many gods of Yotia snarled the wide brick boulevards and cheering crowds thronged in the side streets. The ringing of festival bells crashed and clamored through the city, a high and bright sound of chaotic joy that propelled and intertwined with the music that filled the air. Sanwell had been overwhelmed during his first festival season in Kroog; by his second year in the city, he fell in love with it. Far from the ponderous ceremonies in Argive, the festivals in Kroog and across Yotia were ebullient, alive. Never in his young life had Sanwell lived in a place where the gods were so close—and never did he imagine himself becoming someone who loved that proximity.</p>

<p>But today, in the blood-slick red brick streets, the gods felt quite distant. This day was a dark mirror to those celebration days, and each block the pilots advanced plunged them deeper into that horrible mirror; the ringing bells today were the same bells that tolled on celebration days, only now they screamed.</p>

<p>"Listen," Llora commanded Sanwell and the rest of the pilots. "Stay close to me and order your avengers to do the same—they will avoid civilians better if you let them navigate the crowd on their own. You focus on staying close to me."</p>

<p>Llora and the pilots hurried through the city streets, shoving their way through the fleeing crowds as they made for the northern district. Sanwell labored under the weight of his pilot kit, donned in haste that morning. Not two blocks into the city proper and his jumpsuit was soaked through with sweat under the light cuirass. The satchels he carried—spare powerstones for Sword One, a brace of tools, small and delicate replacement parts—together felt like an anvil's weight across his shoulders. The few encouraging shouts Sanwell registered from the general pandemonium did nothing to hearten him; to the contrary, they seemed thin and hopeless cries. There was a second, lower tone bubbling through the shoving and rushing crowds, a more terrible fear under their immediate panic. This was not just an attack: this was the beginning of a war, and they were losing. Kroog might die, and with it, all Yotia.</p>

<p>The closer they got to the northern districts, the thinner the crowds were, and the louder the sound of fighting. Fewer bells rang here, but they were still audible, echoing in from the other districts still hurrying to evacuate. The closer the pilots came to the northern district, the more bodies they came across as well. At first, they were the crumpled forms of people who had been trampled in the early rush to flee; by the time the pilots reached their rendezvous point, they started to encounter the bloody and burned dead—soldiers and civilians both.</p>

<p>"Hold here, pilots!" Llora shouted, calling them to a halt. The five pilots and their avengers came to a stop in an abandoned market plaza. Overturned stalls and stands scattered bright sprays of spices, fruits, and vegetables across the ground. A small fire licked the charred ruins of a storefront where a food seller's cart had tipped over, spilling hot coals into the shop's dry interior. People had fled in the middle of their morning routines, leaving everything behind.</p>

<p>At the far end of the plaza was a hasty but substantial barricade defended by at least two dozen Yotian soldiers, soot-stained and bloodied after retaking the plaza. The barricade would not hold off a dragon engine, but it would deter any human soldiers from attacking. The Yotian squadron looked to the avengers with hope, and their pilots with concern. Sanwell tried not to look at the pile of dead Yotians, civilians and soldiers both, that lay in a heap next to the small fountain at the center of the square. Debris fluttered in the hot wind stirred by the raging fires. A scatter of dead Fallaji troopers splayed out unceremoniously on the far end of the plaza, arrow shafts sticking from their bodies.</p>

<p>Llora talked with the ranking officer there—a lieutenant, by his stripes; the captain Tawnos had assigned the pilots to had been killed. Sanwell figured the lieutenant to only be a year or so older than he, though it was hard to tell under his heavy armor.</p>

<p>Sanwell overheard the lieutenant say that this had been a second-line medical post before a bitter fight contested the small plaza. The Yotians now planned to use the plaza as a staging ground for the counterattack: Stacks of firebombs, arrows, and darts stood near the barricade. Occasionally, a runner would come sprinting into the square, haggle with the supply officer, and then run back with a bundle of firebombs tossed over their shoulder or a healer in tow.</p>

<p>"Pilot Sanwell," Llora called, waving him over. "Sanwell, this is Lieutenant Markos—" Llora's introduction was drowned out by a roar loud enough to send everyone in the plaza diving for cover. A long, buzzing series of explosions followed moments later, reports echoing out over the city.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align:right;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/JKOd7jSRGf.jpg" />

<p>The bells nearby fell silent. Sanwell and the rest of the pilots, Llora included, stayed prone, their avengers watching over them. Some of the soldiers pushed themselves to their feet, gathering up their spears and adjusting their sword belts, peering over the barricade, crawling back to their posts.</p>

<p>The brick was dry and hot. Sanwell clutched the control rod to his chest. The thumping of his heart against the ground matched the rumbling of the nearby dragon engine on the move.</p>

<p>The bells began to ring again and Llora stood, hollering at the pilots to get up. Lieutenant Markos bellowed at the rest of his soldiers to get to the walls. Sanwell stood on trembling legs, helped up by Rica and Carlo. The two younger pilots stuck close to Llora and had already sent their avengers to the barricade.</p>

<p>Big, booming explosions crashed through the plaza, sending whistling and skittering shards of metal into the air. Sanwell flinched as a chip of plaza brick leapt up and cut his cheek, flung into him by something pinging off the ground as it flashed past him.</p>

<p>Shrapnel—the Fallaji were attacking!</p>

<p>Sanwell, rooted to the spot, watched as Yotian soldiers hurled firebombs over the barricade toward the charging, unseen Fallaji. Smoke and bright flashes followed, explosions thundering and echoing off the storefronts, raining glass and clouds of dust on the street opposite the barricade. Screams mixed with the rising cry of charging Fallaji as they returned fire, launching heavy crossbow bolts and whistling arrows at the Yotians. Sanwell ducked just in time behind Sword One's extended arm, cringing at every whining ping that rattled off the avenger's armor.</p>

<p>Above it all loomed the dragon engine. Mishra's engine. Sanwell saw through the smoke the heat-warped visage of the titanic machine, reptilian, a beast of artifice and war towering high above the building tops of the northern district. It roared, hungry, cruel, <em>alive</em>, and advanced toward them, shrouded once more in the thick smoke.</p>

<p>"Sanwell!" Llora shouted to be heard over the cacophony of combat. "Take Rica and Carlo down that side street," she ordered, pointing with her sword down a narrow alleyway. "Find a way to flank the engine and bring it down, pilot!"</p>

<p>"Yes ma'am!" Sanwell saluted. He started to ask for more direction, but Llora had already hurried toward the wall, a bandolier of firebombs thrown over her shoulder.</p>

<p>"Get your Swords," Sanwell said to Rica and Carlo. "Let's go kill a dragon."</p>

<p>Sanwell led the charge down the side street following Sword One. Rica and Carlo followed behind, Swords Two and Three in tow. The sound of battle at the plaza barricade surely gave their movements some cover. They moved quickly, not quietly.</p>

<p>They made it halfway down the alley before the dragon engine fired a blast into the plaza behind them.</p>

<p>A roar like the sky splitting open, a rippling crescendo of explosions. The boiling red mist scoured the plaza, blasting apart the Yotian barricade and incinerating its defenders.</p>

<p>Sanwell, Rica, and Carlo turned, looking on in horror as the crimson blast swept across their narrow view of the plaza. Llora and the other pilots, Lieutenant Markos and their soldiers—gone in a breath.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align:right;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/dPHCt7RqCP.jpg" />

<p>The smoke lingered, not moving despite the stinking, howling furnace-blast wind. The air itself sizzled, writhed in pain, crackled with heat-tortured bolts of lightning.</p>

<p>A body staggered into the alleyway from the burning plaza. None of the pilots could tell who it was. The poor soldier bounced off the alley wall, stumbling like a drunk, and collapsed, shattering into ash where they hit the ground. All thoughts of revenge and glory quit Sanwell then; worry stopped gnawing and started consuming.</p>

<p>The plaza echoed with the sound of charging boots: soldiers emerged from the boiling smoke, helms slammed shut against the burning air, their anti-mech spears raised toward Swords Four and Five. Their pilots gone, blasted and heat-warped by the dragon engine's burning breath, the machines nevertheless held their ground, swords flashing. A handful of soldiers died, but the avengers were torn down to cheers. They had slowed Mishra's engine for a moment, and the greater advance of his forces not at all.</p>

<p>A moment. Sanwell remembered the years of training; it bought those other pilots, whose names he never knew, a moment.</p>

<p>Carlo started to scream and neither Sanwell nor Rica could get him to calm down. There was no telling whether the Fallaji could hear them, but they couldn't take the risk. Rica tore open a linen bandage from his medical kit and tied it around Carlo's mouth while Sanwell held him steady. The two of them dragged Carlo away into the darkness of the alley, praying that the dragon engine would not follow.</p>

<p>Their sword avengers followed, ash piled on their armored shoulders.</p>

<hr />
<p>Sanwell and Rica, with an alternating mute and screaming Carlo in tow, followed their avengers through the alley into another small and nameless plaza. This one was a crossroads walled in by two- and three-story buildings on all sides. Their alley continued across the plaza; the crossing road was a proper carriageway, wide enough for three carts abreast. At one point in the morning, it had been fortified by a barricade on the northern exit from the plaza, blocking access to the rest of the city against anyone approaching from the Mardun. Now the barricade lay in ruins. Yotian and Fallaji dead splayed across the smoldering wreckage, flies already making meals of them. A stray dog scurried away when the avengers and their pilots came running into the plaza.</p>

<p>Sanwell and Rica ordered their avengers to take up watch on the Mardun side of the crossroads, then staggered to the end of the square opposite the barricade, dragging Carlo with them. His avenger stood still at the end of the alley, awaiting orders. The three of them sat on an overturned cart and caught their breath. The dragon engine hadn't followed them. For the moment, in this quiet corner of besieged Kroog, they were safe.</p>

<p>"What do we do?" Rica asked.</p>

<p>"We can't fight the engine," Sanwell said. "Not even with our Swords—we'd need an army of them to fight that."</p>

<p>"So what do we do?" Rica asked again.</p>

<p>Sanwell looked back down the alleyway they had just emerged from, back toward the scoured plaza. He looked up, at the smoke-darkened sky. The sun, so clear up by the orniary, burned a dim, sick orange. Ash drifted down, black and gray.</p>

<p>"We run," Sanwell said. "Like Tawnos told us—if we're in danger, we run."</p>

<p>Rica took his own survey of their surroundings. "Where?"</p>

<p>The dragon engine bellowed again, deafening, vision-shaking. Sanwell and Rica clapped their hands over their ears, eyes watering at the loudness of the roar. It passed, and like thunder from a moving storm, the two boys listened for its source; it appeared the dragon engine was moving away from them and their avengers, making for the heart of the city.</p>

<p>"Away," Sanwell said, a little too loud as his hearing slowly came back to him. "Anywhere but here. Didn't Tawnos say something about some town? Hinge?"</p>

<p>"Hench," Rica corrected. "Some caravan town, I think. A place for horses to get water."</p>

<p>"Maybe there," Sanwell said.</p>

<p>"We'd have to cross the city," Rica said, chewing his lip. "West might be better—we could run to the western gates and make for the coast, find a ship."</p>

<p>Sanwell hung his head. He thought of his brother, Rendall—was he in the air by now?</p>

<p>"Where would they send the evacuees?" Sanwell asked Rica. "Korlis or Penregon?"</p>

<p>"Korlis is closer," Rica said. "But they're merchants, and they're neutral. Besides, they don't have a standing army, just mercenaries. My guess is Penregon. It's farther, but that's where Urza and—"</p>

<p>A sudden clatter and a shout sounded from northern entrance to the crossroads—the Mardun side where their avengers stood guard.</p>

<p>Sanwell and Rica looked over to see a rank of Fallaji brasscaps approaching the crossroads. Behind them, Sanwell could see what looked like a forest of pikes under which shone the polished brass helms of a whole marching column of soldiers.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align:right;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/JMdBOwSx0O.jpg" />
<p class="embedImageCaption">Art by: <a href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&amp;output=spoiler&amp;method=visual&amp;artist=+[%22Joshua%20Cairos%22]" target="_blank">Joshua Cairos</a></p></div></div>

<p>"Sanwell," Rica said, standing. He wasn't calling Sanwell's attention, only uttering. A reflexive gasp, spoken in disbelief at what he saw: the Fallaji army, unimpeded, marching toward them.</p>

<p>"Sword One," Sanwell cried. He stabbed his command rod toward the Fallaji and pressed the trigger. A thin beam of light visible only in the passing smoke dazzled the front rank of the brasscaps. "Attack!"</p>

<p>Sword One bounded toward the Fallaji, followed a second later by Sword Two. Carlo, catatonic, triggered his control rod, flashing the ground at his feet. Sword Three did not move; the machine had dropped into an idle, sword ready but not raised.</p>

<p>The marching soldiers were unable to form a pike wall before the two avengers crashed into them. The front ranks died in chaos, their pikes skittering off the avengers' armor plating. The two avengers worked their great swords with a butcher's efficiency, grinding the Fallaji advance to a halt at the ruined barricade.</p>

<p>Sanwell watched in horror and awe as the avengers cut through the brasscaps. The sound of their swords buzzing through the air, the heavy, wet thunk of the blades meeting and separating flesh, smashing bone, crunching through the proud, bright Fallaji armor as if it were little more than thin foil. Sanwell could only stagger backward, command rod level and aimed, and watch the avenger interpret his most basic command. Sword One cleaved through the soldiers before it with expeditious strikes. Short chops, one manipulator holding the hilt of its sword and one along the blade to guide it.</p>

<p>Rica piloted Two with precision, directing his avenger toward officers and targets that presented a threat to their machines. Soldiers with heavy explosive-tipped lances and crossbows, officers with their command flags and steady voices—Sword Two, under Rica's command, hunted them through the chaos made by Sword One's assault.</p>

<p>Who taught Sword One how to fight?</p>

<p>Sanwell stabbed his control rod toward a pair of brasscaps who had made it around Sword One. He triggered the rod, dazzling its beam across the soldiers, and Sword One immediately interceded, impaling them both with one heavy lunge. Sword One lifted them and swept them off its weapon, sending their bodies tumbling into the still-advancing column.</p>

<p>At some point Sword One had to learn how to move like that, Sanwell thought, keying another target. He backpedaled, retreating with Rica, dragging Carlo with them, putting distance between them and the fight.</p>

<p>Who taught Sword One how to interpret his simple first command and translate it into movements Sanwell could not do himself? He had seen inside the older models as part of his training—they, like Sword One, were not alive. As he understood it, they could not think. They were machines, humanoid assemblies of a thousand complex calculations and delicate complications; thousands of hours of genius and technical acumen and human labor set to a single purpose, achieved with uncanny grace: to swing a sword and end a life.</p>

<p>Brilliance. Madness.</p>

<p>Sword One ejected its dull blade toward the advancing brasscaps, then drew a fresh razor from the magazine on its back. The avenger moved so smoothly that Sanwell could almost believe it was a giant person in armor, a warrior that could not be stopped by fear, pity, or fatigue. Spears and crossbow bolts shattered on Sword One's legs and deflected off its brachial and thoracic armor plates, each glancing blow driving home how indestructible the avenger was.</p>

<p>Another feeling mixing with Sanwell's fear: relief. Relief that the Swords were on <em>his</em> side.</p>

<p>An explosion boomed out over Sword Two's upper half, staggering the avenger into Sword One. Sword One gracefully sidestepped its fellow, and Sword Two fell back into the plaza, landing hard enough to crack stone.</p>

<p>Rica swore and Sanwell saw why: a bomb had blown away Two's right arm. Hydraulic fluids and dark oil sprayed from the damaged equipment, pumping into the air until Two's internal systems shut off the flow. Drawing a fresh blade with its remaining arm, Sword Two struggled back to standing—but it was too late. The gap had been made.</p>

<p>The Fallaji brasscaps advanced, driven by their officers behind, cheering, hoarse, heartened by the blow dealt to Sword Two. Sword One tried to intercede but could not hold the road by itself. At first only a handful of brasscaps made it through; Sword Two tried to drive them back, but the Fallaji fired a hail of explosive bolts at its head and legs. The reports boomed on top of each other, pressure waves battering the wounded machine back to the ground. As it fell, soldiers swarmed Sword Two, stabbing bomb-pikes into its joints and between its armor plates, arresting its movement. On the other side of the yard, more brasscaps brought the idle Sword Three to the ground, anti-mech pikes stabbing and slicing vital internals, joints, and mechanisms.</p>

<p>Sanwell screamed something wordless, a mix of terror and fury, stabbing his command rod at the Fallaji, stabbing a dazzling beam at them again and again. No commands, nothing from his training, just giving voice to raw panic as the enemy flooded into the crossroads. Sword One fought on, as it was designed to do.</p>

<p>The brasscaps detonated their bomb lances and killed Sword Two. The avenger's powerstone erupted, a bright flash that blanked the square with white light.</p>

<p>Sanwell went flying, blinded by the blast. Somehow, he held on to his command rod, and as he lay on his back he blinked his vision back from burned to blurry. He could see Carlo laying still, near the overturned cart, uniform smoldering. He watched Rica push himself to his feet, his cheekbones and nose raw and burned. A sandpaper wind whipped through the streets of Kroog, scouring Sanwell's own burned face and hands. He cried out in pain, voice muffled as his hearing was slow to return.</p>

<p>The bells still crashed and rang. Other explosions thumped throughout the city.</p>

<p>Distant, screams.</p>

<p>Distant, the roar of dragon engines.</p>

<p>Sanwell's world was a haze of cloudy, gray smoke under an ochre sky. The sun above was a dying marigold, fat and close, threatening to slip from the sky, an egg's yolk sloughed from its white. Everything stank of burning wood, burning oil, burning flesh. Ash fell like snow.</p>

<p>When Sanwell was new to Kroog, dispatched with his brother as a child to learn artifice at the orniary, he'd been schooled in Yotian custom and belief. Cultural education, his parents told him. Necessary for any child of the east, for the young scions of civilization to understand the world they were destined to rule; in this education, Sanwell learned that of the many gods of Yotia and their domains, no single one ruled over an underworld or accursed afterlife. A human soul was too myriad to be thrown into hell on the word of one god: damnation for the Yotians was not that simple. One had many souls throughout the course of their life, and each of them was afforded its own judgment.</p>

<p>Sanwell knew now that the Yotians had missed an aspect. They had forgotten a god somewhere in their celebrations: the one who'd damned his living soul to this city of hell. Sanwell imagined that morbid deity flying above the city on torn wings, belching crimson mist down into its burning streets.</p>

<p>"Sword One," Sanwell whispered into the command rod. "To me." Be it hell or nightmare, Sanwell wanted out.</p>

<p>Dark shapes stalked through the haze, though none cut the reassuring profile of Sword One. Lumpen silhouettes bent over their long spears, wide helms turning slowly, listening, searching.</p>

<p>Sanwell moved up to a crouch, slipping further back from the moving shapes. He padded past Rica and hissed for him to follow.</p>

<p>Rica shook his head and held a finger to his lips. He pointed, directing Sanwell's gaze.</p>

<p>Carlo. He crawled toward Sanwell and Rica. The burns across his back and legs were terrible, rendering him into a mess of blistered flesh and melted steel.</p>

<p>"San?" Carlo cried, sobbing. "Rica?"</p>

<p>Rica started toward Carlo, but Sanwell grabbed him and shoved him back.</p>

<p>The dark shapes in the brick haze stopped, listening. Their broad heads turned. Their spears probed the gently falling ash.</p>

<p>"Where are you guys?" Carlo cried again.</p>

<p>A flurry of crossbow bolts thudded into Carlo's back, killing him. A second volley peppered him seconds later, stray bolts pinging and ricocheting off the ash-covered ground. The brasscaps shouted, calling to each other the location of the dead pilot.</p>

<p>"Sword One, kill!" Sanwell shouted into his command rod, his voice cracking. "Kill!"</p>

<p>Rica turned, grabbed Sanwell, and shoved him to a run. Over his shoulder, Sanwell heard Fallaji soldiers screaming in terror under the rising whine of a laboring, wounded machine. He turned, backpedaling for three short steps, and saw Sword One's tall, armored form rising from the darkness.</p>

<p>Sword One was a heat-warped knight in yolk-yellow light, golden death splattered with soot and ash. Though horribly wounded, Sword One was not dead, and until it was, it would obey Sanwell's last order. Blood-splattered, fearless, the terrible machine may have been another forgotten Yotian god: that of war and the crossroads, of machines and the age to come.</p>

<p>Sanwell threw down his control rod. There was nothing left to command.</p>

<p>"San!" Rica's hands clawed at Sanwell's collar, the other boy trying to pull him along. Sanwell stumbled but did not fall.</p>

<p>Together, the two boys ran.</p>

<p>Kroog died on a crimson morning; the war began at sunrise.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>28 AR</strong></p>

<p>Aiman lay on his back and squinted against the wan light of the marigold sun. The sky was a foul orange tint, deep as the burnt brown of a charred pepper where smoke from still-burning fires belched. Everything stank. Beauty curdled by death, sweet azure sky rusted over, bright bells twisted to screaming.</p>

<p>Aiman needed water.</p>

<p>The thudding thunder of nail-bottomed boots. A stampede of boots. Hundreds, thousands, a million, the whole of the world running by him. One kicked his head hard enough to tumble him over, as the waves once did. Argivian or Fallaji, he could not tell. The strap of his brasscap snapped, and his helm bounced away. Some reinforcements, he thought, running to battle.</p>

<p>To battle!</p>

<p>Kroog, burning city, invaders' city, the city of thieves. Why were they there ? Mishra, the snake-tongue, hungry, jealous. The qadir's greed.</p>

<p>Aiman needed water.</p>

<p>He groaned and tried to move, but when he tried to sit up all strength drained out of him. He coughed, wincing at the pain. He couldn't see well. He looked down his body.</p>

<p>Aiman let slip a weak cry of fear and shock. Three arrows. He'd been hit. One in his upper thigh, one pinning his arm to his chest, and another through his side. Thigh was the deepest, right in the meat. Arm was all the way through, but his arm and breastplate underneath had stopped the arrow from wounding him deeper. Side was little more than a deep cut, trapped in his armor and padded cloth underneath—once the arrow was gone, a clean bandage would be enough. His face throbbed, and a horrible split feeling told him he had been wounded there as well.</p>

<p>Aiman dropped back down.</p>

<p>"I need water," Aiman called out. "Water," he cried, and realized his was only one of many voices adding to a chorus of moaning, weeping, screaming wounded. He looked around, lucidity coming back with the pain.</p>

<p>He was in hell. Bodies packed the space between the buildings, filling the road where they had fought. The gullet of the city, through which soldiers of both kingdoms were ground into meat.</p>

<p>He tried to remember what happened. Some huge golden knight, some bright machine of terror. The column marching forward, shoved by the rear ranks, terrified of death ahead and Mishra's officers behind. Explosions, pain. The boats before that, his hands shaking, the quiet prayer of the soldier next to him, the cold of the river as they charged up the banks, the screams and the screams.</p>

<p>Aiman needed water. He needed to get away. Hands grabbed at him, and a dead man moaned in his ear, begging for his mother. Aiman slapped the hands away with his good arm, gasping for breath. He kicked and scraped, scooting away from the pleading corpse.</p>

<p>Wheezing, Aiman crawled, yelping where the arrow shafts tapped and dragged over the brick. He collapsed against the side of the alley, shaking violently, vision graying.</p>

<p>"Water," Aiman moaned. He was dying. He could feel it. Burning, deep pain throbbed through his leg, his eye, his side—</p>

<hr />
<p>Aiman woke up. It was nighttime. He had passed out.</p>

<p>The alley was silent. The dead draped over every surface. Fires lit the night, casting everything in the pit's own ochre glow. No more bells rang, though Aiman could hear the battle still raging in the distant quarters of Kroog.</p>

<p>Aiman moaned when he saw it. A ghost. A revenant, glowing a soft blue as it picked across the fetid alleyway. Aiman started to pray.</p>

<p>The ghost looked over at him.</p>

<p>Aiman's prayer caught in his throat.</p>

<p>The ghost walked toward him, dim blue form tracing an echo through the hot evening air behind it. Death, Aiman knew it. This was death itself, claiming souls to journey with him.</p>

<p>Death crouched above a horribly wounded man. The man's chest rose and fell, hitched, and then deflated. Aiman could hear the rattle from where he hid.</p>

<p>Death stood. His head tracked across the alley, as if taking in the sight. A harvest, Aiman thought. A harvest for this cold reaper.</p>

<p>"Not yet," Death said. He spoke to the empty alley, but Aiman knew Death spoke to him. Death had a strange accent, like something from the far east. As a boy Aiman had tended his father's trading ship, sailing all around the bounds of Terisiare. Penregon's austere harbor had been a regular enough stop, and Aiman had picked up some Argivian; Death's language sounded similar.</p>

<p>"We're too early," Death said. "We're years away, decades at least. It doesn't happen here."</p>

<p>Relief and confusion flooded through him. Aiman let himself hope.</p>

<p>Death sighed, and then Death disappeared.</p>

<hr />
<p>Two weeks later, Aiman's fever finally broke. He limped out of the airy medical tent, the right side of his body aching and itching, but healing. He had lost an eye; save for that wound, he would suffer no more than puckered scars where the arrows had pierced him.</p>

<p>The dry desert breeze cooled the sweat on his brow.</p>

<p>Aiman's war was done. His life, he knew for certain, was only beginning. He looked up at the pale blue sky, tracked thin clouds in their heights, and watched the birds wheeling.</p>

<p>Death had told him: not yet.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>MTG Arena: Release Notes – Alchemy: The Brothers' War</title><link>https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/mtg-arena/mtg-arena-release-notes-alchemy-the-brothers-war</link><guid>https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/mtg-arena/mtg-arena-release-notes-alchemy-the-brothers-war</guid><description><![CDATA[<p><em>Developer Note: We're experimenting with some of the ways we communicate with players, starting with sunsetting the current "State of the Games" as we separate the purely informational "what" updates from the more philosophical "why" discussions. </em>MTG Arena<em> Release Notes will focus on the "whats," highlighting the major content and new features arriving in the next game update.

<p>The Planeswalkers who gathered to stop the Phyrexians on Dominaria lost—badly. They failed to halt the Phyrexian schemes to stop heroes valiantly fighting their oldest foes. Now, every plane of the Multiverse is in Phyrexian sights with their plan to invade them all. The only hope that remains is to take them out on their home turf, destroying the Phyrexian's means to Multiverse invasion. The risk that some—all—of the heroes fall to Phyrexians is high, but the stakes for everyone else are even higher.</p>

<p>It's now or never for the heroes heading into danger. Planeswalkers team up and head down into New Phyrexia to end the threat of invasion once and for all. Ten total Planeswalkers appear as new cards in <em>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</em>, though which are heroes ready to fight the Phyrexians and which join the Phyrexians in compleated perfection is something the story will reveal.</p>

<p>(You can see Koth's new card below, with other new planeswalker cards to be revealed later with <em>Phyrexia: All Will Be One </em>previews.)</p>

<p>The heroic—and few—Mirran resistance forces remaining may be the Planeswalkers' best chance of striking at the heart of New Phyrexia.</p>

<p>But Phyrexians aren't your typical villains. Some are horrifying.</p>

<p>Some are familiar&mdash;and relentless&mdash;such as the greatest praetor Elesh Norn, ruler of New Phyrexia and mastermind behind building the army poised to conquer the Multiverse.</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Elesh Norn, Mother of Machines" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/JiFJS8JS2DAd.png" style="width: 265px; height: 370px;" /> <img alt="Phyrexian-language Elesh Norn, Mother of Machines" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/4nZlKrOIKV1o.png" style="width: 265px; height: 370px;" /></p>

<p>Some villains remind those of us who remember the past of Mirrodin&mdash;and what's truly been lost.</p>

<h2>First Look at Booster Fun</h2>

<p>New Phyrexia, a place where flesh and metal are one in a hegemonic harmony, and there is one primary edict: spread the revelation of Phyrexian compleatness. From Phyrexian denizens and praetor rulers to the tools they use on the land itself—<em>all </em>reflects this exquisite <em>perfection</em>.</p>

<p>Compleat perfection means incredible cards to open in boosters for fans and Phyrexians alike.</p>

<p>Phyrexian panorama full art and Phyrexianized full-art basic lands can be found in <em>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</em> Draft, Set, and Collector Boosters.</p>

<p>The body-transformation horror of the Phyrexians is an unsettling sight, one that reaches beyond <em>Magic</em>. With art by Junji Ito and more artists, <em>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</em> features the borderless manga treatment for select Phyrexians and characters reimagined as Phyrexians for several heroes fighting them.</p>

<p>Though which are truly heroes and which become Phyrexians is a sleeper agent terror that Ajani's appearance in <em>Dominaria United</em> revealed all too well. You'll discover who truly remains a hero against the Phyrexians (and who falls to compleation) in the <em>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</em> story publishing January 12–17, <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/story" target="_blank">right here at DailyMTG</a>.</p>

<p>Cards with the borderless manga treatment can be found in <em>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</em> Draft, Set, and Collector Boosters.</p>

<p>And that's not all—our return to New Phyrexia led us into our archives to look back at Elesh Norn and the rest of the praetors in concept artwork and vision. With <em>Phyrexia: All Will be One</em>, we can share all five together featuring their concept artwork from the rebirth of the Phyrexians. These borderless concept cards are reprints of praetors from recent sets (and will be legal where those sets are).</p>

</div>

<p>Borderless concept praetors can be found in <em>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</em> Draft, Set, and Collector Boosters.</p>

<p>New Phyrexia was borne from infection by oil—the insidious legacy of original Phyrexia that transforms people, places, and even entire <em>planes</em>—as happened to Mirrodin—into Phyrexian visions of perfection. Several Booster Fun treatments found in <em>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</em> draw on this theme and bring it to cards in the set, such as the ichor treatment.</p>

<div class="figure-wrapper">
<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Elesh Norn, Mother of Machines" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/qZlmVnxntOVW.png" style="width: 265px; height: 370px;" /> <img alt="Phyrexian Obliterator" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/rZyomZEsMonZ.png" style="width: 265px; height: 370px;" /> <img alt="Slobad, Iron Goblin" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/oZqNIE74df8X.png" style="width: 265px; height: 370px;" /></p>

</div>

<p>Cards with the ichor treatment can be found in <em>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</em> Draft, Set, and Collector Boosters.</p>

<p>While these amazing treatments can be found across Draft and Set Boosters, too, <em>Phyrexia: All Will Be One </em>Collector Boosters will always be the best way to find these amazing treatments. Plus, there's one more look that's only available in Collector Boosters: step-and-compleat foils.</p>

<p>These cards feature a unique foil treatment that reveals a pattern of the Phyrexian symbol, similar to the Greek letter Φ, across the card. It's a new look that isn't fully captured in the card images here—each step-and-compleat card features its own card ID number for you collectors out there—but we look forward to showing these off "in person" closer to the <em>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</em> release.</p>

<h2>"Universes Within" Expands with Set Boosters</h2>

<p><em>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</em> is dedicated to the horrors of Phyrexia—and our heroes desperate battle against them—but there's more waiting for <em>Magic </em>players in Set Boosters. <em>The List</em>—reprinted cards often thematically or flavorfully tied to recent <em>Magic </em>releases—will receive an update <em>and</em> include "Universes Within" versions of cards from the <em>Street Fighter x Secret Lair</em> drop.</p>

<p>These versions count just the same—each matching up and counting as the same "unique" card for deck-building purposes—but are flavored from within one of <em>Magic</em>'s own planes. Here's a look at them all coming with <em>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</em>:</p>

<p>We'll share details on how these "Universes Within" cards appear in <em>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</em> Set Boosters when previews kick off in January.</p>

<h2>All Will Be One</h2>

<p>Featuring a massive Planeswalker team-up with ten total planeswalker cards appearing in the set, <em>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</em> lets players move to take on the Phyrexians—or join their forces—with the fate of the Multiverse hanging in the balance.</p>

That means it's time to answer your questions about <em>The Brothers' War</em>.</p>

<p>Here's the tweet I posted:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It's time for me to write a mailbag column about <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MTGBRO?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MTGBRO</a>. Please keep your questions about The Brothers&amp;#39; War to a single tweet, one question per tweet. Thanks. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WotCStaff?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#WotCStaff</a></p>&amp;mdash; Mark Rosewater (@maro254) <a href="https://twitter.com/maro254/status/1591119235862122496?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 11, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>As always, I'll try to answer as many questions as I can, but here's why I might not answer your question:</p>

<ul>
	<li>I have an allotted word count, which means that there are only so many questions I can get to.</li>
	<li>Someone else might have asked the same question. I will usually answer the first person who asks.</li>
	<li>Some questions I either don't know the answer to or don't feel qualified enough in the area to answer properly.</li>
	<li>Some topics I'm not allowed to answer for all sorts of reasons, including previews for future sets.</li>
</ul>

<p>That said, let's get to the questions:</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/The_Spun_Yarn/status/1591122825552986112" target="_blank"><strong>Q: I</strong><strong>t's a classic one: There's an incomplete cycle of mythic rare prototype cards where each color but white got a big artifact creature with a prototype cost. What happened to white's prototype?</strong></a></p>

<p>At mythic rare, we decided that each color would get an artifact with one of the two artifact keywords in the set. Blue, black, red, and green got a prototype card, while white got an unearth card. Note that white has two rare prototype cards, more than any other color at rare.</p>

<p>Most of the time, we use a 4/1 rule where we try not to have four cards act one way and the fifth act a different way, but we made an exception here because we just liked Platoon Dispenser at mythic rare.</p>

<p>I should also point out that white is one of only two colors (the other being blue) to get a second mythic rare artifact with its color of mana showing up exclusively in the rules text.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/AdamTRRollins/status/1591132085959659521" target="_blank"><strong>Q: </strong><strong>Now that we've met the BRO, when will we meet the rest of the MTG family?</strong></a></p>

<p>Well, MOM's coming out next year. : )</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Reuxben/status/1591121144496914432" target="_blank"><strong>Q: </strong><strong>As frivolous as it is, was there ever any hesitation to using BRO as the set code, or was it more of a happy coincidence?</strong></a></p>

<p>I heard nothing but people saying, "That's awesome."</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/chlc3d/status/1591119563206582272" target="_blank"><strong>Q: </strong><strong>Did you ever think about putting more than one Onulet in the set, like maybe a cycle of Onulets?</strong></a></p>

<p>I think you're making a deep-cut joke here, so let me explain. When the East Coast Playtesters Skaff Elias, Jim Lin, Dave Petty, and Chris Page, along with Guest Designer Joel Mick, designed <em>Antiquities</em>, they made a card called Onulets. They chose that name because it was similar to the card <auto-card>Soul Net</auto-card> from <em>Alpha</em>. Onulets is an anagram of Soul Net. Unfortunately, the art came back with only one creature in it, so they had to change the name from Onulets to <auto-card>Onulet</auto-card>, thus ruining the anagram. They liked how it sounded though, so they kept the name as it was.</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Soul Net" src="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=41&amp;type=card" /> <img alt="Onulet" src="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=1015&amp;type=card" /></p>

<p>From a design standpoint, there wasn't space for a whole cycle and there were issues with the color pie as not all five colors can directly gain life.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/VOscientist/status/1591120069425528832" target="_blank"><strong>Q: </strong><strong>How many current staff were around when the original story of Urza and company was written? I imagine it would be a fun nostalgia trip for them.</strong></a></p>

<p>None. Charlie Catino has been at Wizards the longest, and he started in February of 1995. Bill Rose and I, second and third respectively, started in October of 1995. <em>Antiquities</em> came out in March of 1994, almost a year before Charlie began at Wizards and a year and half before Bill and I arrived. Both Charlie and Bill were <em>Alpha</em> playtesters, but neither worked on <em>Antiquities</em>. <em>The Brothers' War</em> novel came out in May of 1998, many years after all three of us started, but it was done out of house by author Jeff Grubb, so we still didn't have anything to do with it. That said, many of us here in Studio X are longtime<em> Magic</em> players, so we have an affinity for the story even though none of us had a hand in its creation.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/ManvsManatee/status/1591120130981138432" target="_blank"><strong>Q: </strong><strong>Was it ever considered to have "Spotlight: Act X" similar to how <em>War of the Spark</em> used it? It would have been a useful way to tell when in the Brothers' War or the present something takes place.</strong></a></p>

<p>I think it was discussed, but the scope of the story here is so much longer than <em>War of the Spark</em>. That story took place in a single day, so it was difficult when seeing a lone picture to understand what act it was from (other than the sky changed as the day progressed). <em>The Brothers' War</em>, in contrast, takes place over seven decades. In Act I, Urza and Mishra are boys, in Act II men, and in Act III old men, so the visuals do a much better job of conveying where it takes place in the story.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/mtg_ds/status/1591185001311514624" target="_blank"><strong>Q: Twice in your #MTGBRO design podcast, you refer to the demo decks that you and Ari designed as "prototypes." Is that the term you used to describe them during design? And if so, did that term leak into the name of the mechanic?</strong></a></p>

<p>I think we called them "demo decks" when we made them. I'm just doing a lot of content on <em>The Brothers' War</em>, so I think the word "prototype" seeped into my brain.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/TehLiger/status/1591120333783715840" target="_blank"><strong>Q: </strong><strong>Is there a reason why the Transformers cards use convert instead of transform, even though stuff that affects/is affected by transform works on it?</strong></a></p>

<p>Whenever we use another IP, we work closely with them to ensure that we're following their standards and using the characters as they would. Transformers don't "transform," they "convert," so we used the same terminology on our cards. To have the rules treat them the same, we made the terms "transform" and "convert" synonymous.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/ABL831/status/1591191659517181952" target="_blank"><strong>Q: </strong><strong>Was there any discussion about reprinting a card originally from <em>Antiquities</em>? Feels like some could have made sense, like Sage of Lat-Nam.</strong></a></p>

<p>There was plenty of talk about it. We did explore several reprints, including <auto-card>Sage of Lat-Nam</auto-card>, the Urza lands, and numerous artifacts like <auto-card>Yotian Soldier</auto-card> and <auto-card>Ornithopter</auto-card>. The set ended up getting a bonus sheet of artifact reprints, so it felt wrong to put artifact reprints in the main set. <auto-card>Sage of Lat-Nam</auto-card>'s issue was that artifact sacrificing wasn't in blue (neither in the color pie nor the themes of the set). Other suggestions like the Urza lands proved to be too powerful for Standard. It was something we wanted to do, if possible, but it was a low priority, and it sadly didn't work out.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Ehksidian/status/1591120728467832836" target="_blank"><strong>Q: </strong><strong>Did you ever plan on having Vehicle synergies/focus in BRO? Or was the plan to always focus primarily on "normal artifact" creatures?</strong></a></p>

<p>We discussed Vehicles when building our demo decks and again in vision design. We were trying to give the artifacts in the set a retro feel, and Vehicles just felt too modern. We had a similar discussion about Equipment. In this case, we felt <em>Antiquities</em> (the set we were using as inspiration) did have the equivalent of Equipment with cards like <auto-card>Ashnod's Battle Gear</auto-card> and <auto-card>Tawnos's Weaponry</auto-card>, but it felt more acceptable to include them using our current design standards.</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Ashnod's Battle Gear" src="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=995&amp;type=card" /> <img alt="Tawnos's Weaponry" src="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=1026&amp;type=card" /></p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/strangehatter/status/1591198363180998662" target="_blank"><strong>Q: </strong><strong>Was there any thought in adding Wastes as a land to this set?</strong></a></p>

<p>In vision design, we did spend some time talking about whether we wanted to use colorless mana as a cost (as we did in <em>Oath of the Gatewatch</em>). We even went so far as to explore the idea of having fifteen draft archetypes with colorless mana filling the role of a sixth "color." In the end, it just didn't feel right, much like how Vehicles felt out of place.</p>

<p>Once we decided not to have colorless costs, there just wasn't much point in having Wastes. Cool flavor (as <em>Antiquities</em> had <auto-card>Strip Mine</auto-card>, a very famous and powerful card) is seldom a reason to include something that doesn't make sense mechanically, so Wastes were out as an option.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/35mads/status/1591120729143406594" target="_blank"><strong>Q: </strong><strong>When putting the old border artifact cards in, did you first think about what makes sense in flavor/theme or how they would play in Limited?</strong></a></p>

<p>There are numerous factors that go into choosing cards to put on a bonus sheet, but one of those factors is how the cards will play in Limited. It's okay to have some cards that players would be excited to open and own that don't play well in Limited, but we want most cards on a bonus sheet to be a positive addition to Limited play.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Spencer_AZ/status/1591120863554076673" target="_blank"><strong>Q: </strong><strong>What was the hardest part of re-re-visiting a story?</strong></a></p>

<p>The Brothers' War—the story that is—wasn't designed as a story to maximize building a <em>Magic</em> set around it. Yes, it was an element of <em>Antiquities</em>, but more in a "these objects hint at a larger story" sense than in how we build sets nowadays. The story mostly came from the novel, which spent some time name-dropping <em>Antiquities</em> cards, but again, we weren't trying to design a story that maximized our ability to build a set out of it.</p>

<p>For example, the story is light on things that are in the green slice of the color pie, so we had to play up the end of the story to get enough green cards. We joked that, in many ways, making <em>The Brothers' War</em> was like designing a <em>Universes Beyond</em> set, as the story and characters were locked into place for the entirety of the design. Normally, if a set needs something, we can adjust the world accordingly. For instance, we needed Werewolves to be in red and green in original <em>Innistrad</em>, so the Creative team reshaped the world to make it true.</p>

<p>On the plus side, there was a lot of low-hanging fruit for us to pick. For instance, players have been asking for Ashnod and Gix cards for years, so it was great to finally deliver on them.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/kilpta47/status/1591200788285558785" target="_blank"><strong>Q: </strong><strong>Were there any other "final forms" you considered for Urza and Mishra besides meld cards? How did you land on three versions of Urza and Mishra in the set?</strong></a></p>

<p>Interestingly, there were not. When Aaron and I first talked about seeing if we could make a premier set out of the Brothers' War, Aaron suggested we make a meld Urza and Mishra. The demo decks Ari and I created as proof of concept had them. The response to them was quite positive, and while they went through redesign, we never looked for a different option than meld.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/godofgrenades/status/1591121196451770368" target="_blank"><strong>Q: </strong><strong>Are Treasures proving a touch stronger than they first seemed a reason we see all the Powerstones come into play tapped?</strong></a></p>

<p>As with any mechanical theme, seeing how it's used in play shapes how we balance other mechanical elements that interact in a similar space.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/LeachJus/status/1591121480200638464" target="_blank"><strong>Q: </strong><strong>Meld was an interesting mechanic in <em>Eldritch Moon</em> because you actually had a pair of commons that had the ability and could be triggered very easily. What was the thought process for bringing this mechanic back but exclusively in pairs requiring a rare and a mythic rare for each?</strong></a></p>

<p>As I explained in <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/making-magic/act-of-war-part-1" target="_blank">my first preview article</a>, we did experiment with common meld cards in vision design. In fact, we handed off a cycle of common cards where an artifact creature and a spell in each color melded together. There were many factors that kept them from making it to print.</p>

<p>Firstly, common meld cards require a lot of structure to support. You need a way to ensure players can get them in the same deck at a high enough rate in Limited. Then you need to make sure the set has enough tools to increase your ability to draw both. You also need to make sure certain elements that are commonly found in <em>Magic</em> sets don't disrupt them.</p>

<p>Secondly, the set was, at its core, about giant artifact armies fighting one another, and other elements of the set just played better into that theme than the common meld cards.</p>

<p>Lastly, there was just too much complexity in the set, and the meld commons were on the complex side. I do think one day we'll make a set with common meld cards, but it will be because it plays into the focus of what the set is doing.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Zwa_Sable/status/1591206479537016833" target="_blank"><strong>Q: </strong><strong>You insisted on the necessity of colored artifacts to keep the balance of an artifact set, but this set has only one. Why did you decide that?</strong></a></p>

<p>It has only one artifact with colored mana in its mana cost (the machine from the present that allows Teferi to go back in time), but it's filled to the gills with artifacts that require colored mana to maximize their power. The problem with previous artifact blocks is that color played no role. Any deck could play any powerful artifact. Most artifacts in <em>The Brothers' War </em>can't just go into any deck because of the color restrictions, so it addresses that issue.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/srpad/status/1591121966794407936" target="_blank"><strong>Q: </strong><strong>Do you think that prototype should have used a counter of some kind as a marker to help with memory issues?</strong></a></p>

<p>We did make a punch-out counter for it. You'll find them in Draft and Set Boosters. It's in the same slot as the tokens and the DFC helper card.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/PanchaudJulian/status/1591215190695182338" target="_blank"><strong>Q: How come artifacts that have a mana color in their text box or reference a basic land type have a set number that places them with those colored cards instead of after lands with the rest of the artifacts like they always have been?</strong></a></p>

<p><em>Magic</em> has defaults, but we're willing to move away from them if the set has a need for it. In this case, we made a significant number of artifacts that essentially connect to a certain color, meaning in both Limited and Constructed, you're significantly less likely to play them if you don't have access to the relevant color. Playtesters were treating them like that color for purposes of organization (such as how you make piles when building for Limited), so we changed the default to match player intuition.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/gushonupkeep/status/1591123748350230529" target="_blank"><strong>Q: </strong><strong>Why does Mishra's Foundry exist when you could have just reprinted Mishra's Factory, and why the "attacking Assembly-Worker" clause?</strong></a></p>

<p><auto-card>Mishra's Factory</auto-card> is too strong for Standard. Mishra's Foundry is basically a redesign of <auto-card>Mishra's Factory</auto-card> set at the right power level. The reason it only pumps attacking Assembly-Workers is to make the card more about offense than defense. The original <auto-card>Mishra's Factory</auto-card> had the ability to block as a 3/3 (animate it into a 2/2, block, then tap to give itself +1/+1), which tended to shut boards down more than Play Design wanted.</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Mishra's Factory" src="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=1072&amp;type=card" /> <img alt="Mishra's Foundry" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/bro/en_uEklXokTxM.png" style="height: 310px;" /></p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Ty_Sylicus/status/1591125667701489664" target="_blank"><strong>Q: </strong><strong>I'm curious why there is such a large number of story spotlight cards in BRO.</strong></a></p>

<p>The set is a top-down design built around the story. If ever a set is supposed to have a lot of story spotlights, it's a set like <em>The Brothers' War</em>.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Kyori58/status/1591129465744424960" target="_blank"><strong>Q: </strong><strong>How did you arrive at the conclusion to put all 'walkers in this set in blue between this and DMU?</strong></a></p>

<p>The planeswalker cards in this set are the ones key to the story. Teferi is the time mage that goes back to the Brothers' War to gather information, Saheeli is the artificer needed to copy the Sylex (to stop the Phyrexians), and Urza is the protagonist. All three being blue was more happenstance than a planned thing. We did color balance the larger Standard environment, which is why <em>Dominaria United</em> didn't have any blue planeswalker cards.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/MPoston410/status/1591136658891583488" target="_blank"><strong>Q: </strong><strong>What was your one thing with this set? And I mean what was the one thing you needed and made sure got pushed and into the set? Be it a single card, mechanic, or even something that was just to fit the flavor of doing something that has already happened in the lore.</strong></a></p>

<p>I cared most about not having colored mana in the mana costs of artifacts (save the one item from the present) and having as many top-down references to <em>The Brothers' War</em> and <em>Antiquities</em> as possible. I feel we were successful in both goals.</p>

<h2>Cease-Fire</h2>

<p>That's all the time I have for questions today. I want to thank everyone who took the time to send me a question. I'm sorry I couldn't get to them all. As always, I'm eager for any feedback on today's column, on any of the questions, or on <em>The Brothers' War</em> itself. You can <a href="mailto:making.magic@hotmail.com">email</a> me or contact me through my social media accounts (<a href="https://twitter.com/maro254" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://markrosewater.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Tumblr</a>, <a href="http://instagram.com/mtgmaro" target="_blank">Instagram</a>, and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@markrosewater" target="_blank">TikTok</a>).</p>

<p>Join me next week for another one of my Storm Scale articles.</p>

<p>Until then, may you and your siblings get along slightly better than Urza and Mishra.</p>

<p>Just diving into the case here? For details on the new set, check out these articles covering all the facts you'll need to know for <em>Streets of New Capenna</em>:</p>

<p><em>The List</em> usually consists of 300 cards picked from across <em>Magic</em>'s history. These appear about 25% of the time in the last card slot of Set Boosters. With each new set, a portion of these cards are replaced with cards that fit the latest set's mechanics and themes.</p>

<p>But this time, things are a little different—one might even say<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> <em>stranger</em>. Now, <em>The List</em> includes <em>Magic</em>-themed versions of <em>Secret Lair x Stranger Things</em> cards. These feature art that is different from the <em>Secret Lair</em> drop but the cards are mechanically identical and count as the same card as found in the <em>Secret Lair</em> drop when building decks—you can use four in most cases, or just one if you're playing Commander. (The artwork on cards featured in the <em>Secret Lair </em>drop remains unique to that product.)</p>

<p>What's more, to accommodate the <em>Secret Lair x Stranger Things</em> cards,<em> The List</em> for <em>Streets of New Capenna </em>has fewer cards—67 total. Of those, 58 are from <em>Magic</em>'s history that complement the narrative and mechanical themes of the set.</p>

<p>The overall distribution of <em>The List </em>cards in Set Boosters remains unchanged: they appear in the final card slot of Set Boosters about 25% of the time. On average, one in eight Set Boosters can potentially have a <em>Magic</em>-themed <em>Secret Lair x Stranger Things</em> card!</p>

<p>But there's even more jazzing up <em>The List</em> this time. We're always looking for new ways to enhance Set Boosters, so among those new cards from <em>Magic</em>'s history is a special non-foil Rafiq of the Many featuring new art and the <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/behind-scenes-streets-new-capennas-stylish-booster-fun-2022-04-07" target="_blank"><em>Streets of New Capenna </em>golden age treatment</a>!</p>

<p>Whether it's your first time here or you've been to Ravnica before, welcome. Ravnica sets are some of the post popular <em>Magic</em> sets ever made, and so you're playing at a wonderful time!</p>

<p>Ravnica has plenty going on this time around, both old and new.</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x6Dff3PRv-c?rel=0" width="560"></iframe></p>

<aside>
<p><strong><em>Guilds of Ravnica</em></strong><strong> Prerelease is this weekend!</strong></p>

<p>Prerelease events are your first chance to play with all the brand-new cards in <em>Guilds of Ravnica</em>.</p>

<p>The action begins this weekend, September 29–30, so find a <a href="http://locator.wizards.com/" target="_blank">store near you</a> to join in and stand with your guild!</p>
</aside>

<p>There's no better way to jump-start jumping into the world of Ravnica than the Prerelease. It's everyone's first chance to get their hands on the cards. No matter your skill level, no matter your background, the Prerelease is a <em>Magic</em> event you don't want to miss!</p>

<p>But what's a Prerelease? What should you be expecting at one? And what makes them so awesome?</p>

<p>Let's take a look!</p>

<h1>Welcome to Ravnica</h1>

<p>Prereleases are my favorite <em>Magic</em> events of the year.</p>

<p>No matter where in the world I am or what time of year it is, I always try and go check out a local Prerelease. And I'm not alone; tons of <em>Magic</em> players, from seasoned veterans to folks just starting out, do the same! Prereleases are among the most popular events we throw.</p>

<p>Why? Because Prereleases are some of the most fun you can have playing <em>Magic</em>!</p>

<p>There's nothing quite like it. You get to sit down, pick up some brand-new cards, and figure out how you want to use them at the same time everybody else is. It's an even playing field in a casual environment, where everybody shares all that bubbling energy and excitement around a new <em>Magic</em> set!</p>

<p>I visited my first Prerelease when I was just eleven and instantly fell in love with the event. Seventeen years later, not too much has changed—and Prereleases are better than ever!</p>

<p>Prereleases are great because the set is totally new, the footing is fairly equal as everybody plays with the set for the very first time, and you're all just relaxing and having fun exploring the new cards. It's just a lot of fun for old and new players alike!</p>

<p>If you're a <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/gameplay/formats/sealed-deck" target="_blank">Sealed Deck</a> veteran, you may want to skip ahead to the next section, where I talk about some of the differences you can expect at your local store for <em>Guilds of Ravnica</em>. But if you're new to the wide world of Sealed Deck or are maybe just looking for a few extra pointers, then read on!</p>

<p>All right. So, let's go over perhaps the most important part: finding a place to play a Prerelease! After all, you can't very well play if you don't know where to go. How might you go about that?</p>

<p>If you don't already have a local shop you frequent, be sure to check out the <a href="http://locator.wizards.com/" target="_blank">store locator</a> to find one near you! That store may even offer preregistration. Prereleases are some of the most popular events we put on, so be sure to check and see if the store preregisters. The best time to find out if an event is full is decidedly not when you show up and learn you can't play, so be sure to plan ahead.</p>

<p>Have you found your store? Excellent!</p>

<p>Now it's time to look ahead and prepare for the event. While you will be building your deck for the event with cards you're given when you get there, there's plenty to do besides just that.</p>

<p>Be sure to pack all the supplies you will need during this trip to Ravnica! For example, you may still want to bring a Standard deck to play for fun between rounds, a trade binder, pen and paper to keep track of life, and even a water bottle.</p>

<p>A Prerelease event tends to take about 4–5 hours, so make sure to set aside enough time for the entire event. And you're going to need some fuel with all of that battling, so you may want to bring something like a protein bar or apple as well to snack on. (You may want to check with the store as well; they might even sell some food there!)</p>

<p>Okay now, let's see. You have a store selected on your map, and you've filled your pack with everything you'll need. You've even read through the recent <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/columns/magic-story" target="_blank"><em>Magic</em> Story</a>, so you're up to date on what's been going on to bring us to Ravnica. And, of course, you've taken a look at all the awesome cards in the <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/card-image-gallery/guilds-ravnica-2018-09-19" target="_blank"><em>Guilds of Ravnica</em> Card Image Gallery</a>. Perhaps, if you were curious what a tournament might be like, you might have checked out my article conveniently titled "<a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/beyond-basics/your-first-tournament-2017-02-23" target="_blank">Your First Tournament</a>."</p>

<p>You're all set! Now it's time to actually go and open up some of those cards!</p>

<p>Things are a little different for <em>Guilds of Ravnica</em> compared to your typical Prerelease. So, whether you're new or a veteran, take a close look at what we have going on this time!</p>

<p>If the name of the set didn't give it away, Ravnica is all about guilds. Guilds, guilds, guilds!</p>

<p>What's a guild? On Ravnica, there are ten two-color factions called guilds. Each one has its own personality, mechanic, and style of play. In <em>Guilds of Ravnica</em>, we have five of them: the red-white righteous militia of Boros, the blue-red mad scientists of Izzet, the blue-black sneaky spies of Dimir, the black-green masters over life and death of Golgari, and the unified green-white conclave of Selesnya.</p>

<p>Which one do you identify with? If you're not sure, go take a look at the description of each guild on the <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/story/planes/ravnica" target="_blank">Ravnica plane page</a> and see which one resonates!</p>

<p>Which guild you are is going to be really important. Because at the Prerelease, you're actually choosing a guild!</p>

<p>When you sign up, you'll pick one of the five guilds. (While supplies last—so you will definitely want to preregister for your guild if you can!) Let's say you're like me and you like Dimir. You'll get a box that looks like this:</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Dimir box" src="https://media.wizards.com/2018/images/daily/RZpTSlz614.png" /></p>

<p>Inside, you'll get five normal <em>Guilds of Ravnica</em> boosters <em>plus</em> a special "seeded" booster. This contains one of eight different rares or mythic rares as your Prerelease card, plus a ton of cards to give you a head start on building a two-color deck of that guild. There are some themes in the boosters built around the rares/mythic rare that you open (not to mention some mana fixing!) so this should really help your deck fire off on all cylinders.</p>

<p>Now to continue with Dimir, let's take a look at the other goodies you get inside:</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="What's Inside" src="https://media.wizards.com/2018/images/daily/9zE3FNourV_b.png" /></p>

<p>So much cool stuff! Now welcome to Dimir—it looks like I sneakily convinced you to join! Ha!</p>

<p>Or . . . maybe not. Okay, fine. Maybe one of the other four guilds appeals to you. Well, here's what those Prerelease packs look like too:</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Boros Legion" src="https://media.wizards.com/2018/images/daily/4ItMjdDRdO.png" /><img alt="Izzet League" src="https://media.wizards.com/2018/images/daily/XvXeDBUGEh.png" /><img alt="Golgari Swarn" src="https://media.wizards.com/2018/images/daily/OWK7AqR9k3.png" /></p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Selesnya Conclave" src="https://media.wizards.com/2018/images/daily/aE4H86x7t9.png" /></p>

<p>Pretty nifty, right?</p>

<p>But, of course, front and center are those booster packs. Let's talk about what to do with those next!</p>

<h1>Building Your Guild</h1>

<p>First things first: crack open those booster packs! Then, you'll have a stack of cards.</p>

<p>So . . . what now?</p>

<p>It's time to build your deck, of course!</p>

<p>Sealed Deck is a little different from normal deck building. You get to build a deck using only the cards in front of you, plus as many basic lands as you'd like. Also, unlike a normal Constructed deck where the minimum deck size is 60, you only have to play 40 cards.</p>

<p>The first thing you're going to want to do is figure out a method to pick which colors you'll be playing. Fortunately, these Prerelease packs come with a pretty easy one: that theme booster! I recommend sticking to your guild and playing those two colors. (Though, if you have enough mana fixing, you could maybe splash for a third color if you wanted.)</p>

<p>But if you want to shop around to other colors (what's more Dimir than having a Dimir deck box when you're actually playing Selesnya, I suppose?), things that may draw you into specific colors are:</p>

<ul>
    <li>A really strong rare you're excited about;</li>
    <li>Plenty of "removal" cards that can deal with your opponent's creatures;</li>
    <li>A lot of playable cards in that color; and</li>
    <li>A good "mana curve" in that color—meaning lots of creatures with different costs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ideally, the colors you pick will have all four, but if two or three of those are true, that's plenty good.</p>

<p>Whatever your method, you're going to need to narrow down what you're playing. If you get stuck at the Prerelease, feel free to ask the players around you for help. (You are allowed to do this at a Prerelease; everyone is there to make sure it's a fun event!)</p>

<p>Now you have your colors down. From there, how do you take everything you have and figure out which 22–23 cards you're going to want to put in your deck?</p>

<p>Here's one process that may help!</p>

<p>First, lay your creatures out in mana-cost order. This helps you see what creatures you're going to potentially be able to cast at each part of the game. (Don't lay your noncreatures out at this point unless they're cards you are planning to play as soon as you have that much mana—for example, you will generally cast a <auto-card>Child of Night</auto-card> on turn two, whereas Severed Strands isn't usually a turn-three play.)</p>

<p>A good "mana curve" of creatures is crucial to a successful Sealed deck. You don't want to have a ton of cards at any single spot in the curve. It's important for you to have a good mix so you can play your cheap spells in the early game and your expensive spells in the late game. As a very general rule for Limited, I would look to play something like this:</p>

<ul>
    <li>1 mana: 0–2 creatures</li>
    <li>2 mana: 4–6 creatures</li>
    <li>3 mana: 3–5 creatures</li>
    <li>4 mana: 2–4 creatures</li>
    <li>5 mana 1–3 creatures</li>
    <li>6-plus mana: 0–2 creatures</li>
</ul>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="" src="https://media.wizards.com/2017/images/daily/BB20170525_New-curve.png" /></p>

<p>That's far from hard and fast, but it's a good place to start. Cull your creatures down to these numbers by choosing your favorites.</p>

<p>Now that you have your core creature base figured out, it's time to add in spells! Pick your favorites among your colors to bring your deck to 22 or 23 cards, and then you're good to go from the spell side.</p>

<p>The spells you're going to want the most are what are called "removal spells"—these are the spells that permanently neutralize your opponent's creatures by either dealing damage, keeping them tapped, or just straight-up destroying them. Sealed Deck <em>Magic</em> is all about creatures, so you'll want to play most of the cards in your colors that can get rid of your opponent's creatures.</p>

<p>If you want to learn more about mana curves, you can also check out my article on how to build a mana curve by clicking <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/beyond-basics/how-low-can-you-go-2017-10-19" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>Interested in more tips? Here are a few more things to keep in mind for deck building:</p>

<ul>
    <li>You can play more than 40 cards, but you really should stick to 40 if possible. Every card you play past 40 just means it's that much less likely you're going to draw that awesome rare you put in your deck!</li>
    <li>The land ratio you're looking at should be about seventeen lands to 23 nonlands. This isn't right 100% of the time, but most Limited decks end up looking like this, and, in general, it's what I would want to have.</li>
    <li>Play a mix of cheap-to-cast and expensive-to-cast cards. If you have all cheap, small creatures, then a single big creature can shut you down. If you have all large, expensive creatures, you risk getting run over first. Stick to a mix that focuses on the two-, three-, four-, and five-casting-cost creatures. More games of Sealed Deck are won by casting a creature every turn starting on turn two or three than any other way.</li>
    <li>Evasion is important! Often, Sealed Deck games will get into stalls where both players have a lot of creatures and neither player can attack very well. Creatures with abilities like flying ensure that you can break through these creature stalls.</li>
    <li>Ravnica has a lot of mana fixing. It is possible to splash a third color if you open up the right Guildgates and Lockets. However, unless you are truly a honed veteran, I would try and refrain from playing more than three colors, as tempting as it may be!</li>
    <li>Unlike most <em>Magic</em> formats, Sealed tends to be a little slower. If your deck is on the slow side, choosing to draw (go second) rather than play (go first) can be reasonable to give you that extra card.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Two-Headed Giant</h1>

<p>Some stores also support a version of Sealed Deck called <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/gameplay/formats/two-headed-giant" target="_blank">Two-Headed Giant</a> (often abbreviated "2HG"), where two players team up against other pairs of players. Each pair gets two Prerelease boxes from which the players build their decks. (If you've had a chance to try out the recent <em>Battlebond</em> set, you may already be familiar!)</p>

<p>How does it work?</p>

<p>Well, the simple version is this: you and your teammate work together to build two 40-card decks. Then, you play against another pair of players in a one-game match.</p>

<p>How does this kind of multiplayer play out? It's simple: all your creatures and lands are separate, but you each share the same 30-point life total and take your turns simultaneously—plus you can block for each other too! To do the best you can, you'll need to work together to overcome the opposition.</p>

<h1>Open Dueling</h1>

<p>If the idea of spending a day playing a tournament doesn't fit into how you prefer to play <em>Magic</em>, or if you have less time and just want to experience Ravnica on your own time, you can get involved in Open Dueling!</p>

<p>You get a ready-to-play 60-card Planeswalker Deck and use it to do battle against others participating in Open Dueling, including players participating in the main tournament who are between rounds. This is a great way to dip your toe into the water if you aren't sure the Prerelease is something you want to do or if you can't commit 5 hours to a Prerelease event. You can just play games in Open Dueling at your own leisure. Plus, it's fun!</p>

<p>Ask your local store about Open Dueling at the Prerelease, and prepare to battle!</p>

<h1>Boxing Day</h1>

<p>Something new to Prerelease is the ability to actually pick up a box at the Prerelease!</p>

<p>That's right: if you preorder a booster box of <em>Guilds of Ravnica</em> ahead of time, you can actually buy your box and bring it home (or crack it all open there!) right away. Contact your local store for more details.</p>

<p>Similarly, you can buy Planeswalker Decks on Prerelease day as well! Open dueling or no, feel free to pick up a deck and get to battling!</p>

<h1>Mechanic Mayhem</h1>

<p>Each guild in Guilds of Ravnica has its own wild mechanic, so there's plenty to learn about!</p>

<h1>Welcome Back to Ravnica</h1>

<p>Ravnica has always held a special place in my heart. When I first started playing competitively, it was with <em>Ravnica: City of Guilds</em>. When I got to R&amp;D in Wizards, the first set I worked on was <em>Return to Ravnica</em>. And now, all these years later, to get to work on another Ravnica set as a senior designer . . . well, it's a real treat.</p>

<p>And I think you'll have a blast with what we put together!</p>

<p>So gather up your friends, take another look through the <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/card-image-gallery/guilds-ravnica-2018-09-19" target="_blank">Card Image Gallery</a>, make sure you're preregistered at your <a href="http://locator.wizards.com/" target="_blank">local store</a>, and get ready to come out to the Prerelease and have fun!</p>

<p>Have any thoughts or questions? Wondering what to expect? I'm happy to hear from you! You can always get in contact with me by <a href="http://www.twitter.com/gavinverhey" target="_blank">sending me a tweet</a> or asking a question on <a href="http://www.gavinverhey.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">my Tumblr</a>. I'll be around.</p>

<p>May your Prerelease—no matter how many times you've been to Ravnica—be wonderful. Choose your guild and have a marvelous time!</p>

<p>I've been trying to get a message through, but the Consulate keeps jamming me out. They are trying to keep the people placid, trying to make joining the resistance resistible. But it is time to punch through and fight for what you believe in.</p>

<p>If you see this, please, heed the call. The renegades need you, now more than ever.</p>

<p>Will you join us?</p>

</div>

<p>The world of Kaladesh has been turned on its head. The wondrous Inventors' Fair was nothing more than a scheme. The Consulate has cracked down on energy expenditure. In a place of invention, it has never been a more dangerous time to be an inventor.</p>

<p>It's time to take back the power—by fighting at your local Prerelease, of course!</p>

<p>So where exactly is a Prerelease, and what exactly should you be expecting at one? Read on!</p>

<h1>Prepare for your Prerelease</h1>

<p>Prereleases are my favorite <em>Magic</em> events of the year.</p>

<p>No matter where in the world I am or what time of year it is, I always try and go check out a local Prerelease. Many longtime <em>Magic</em> players will say the same.</p>

<p>Why? Well, Prereleases are just some of the most fun you can have playing <em>Magic</em>!</p>

<p>You get to sit down, pick up some brand new cards, and figure out how you want to use them at the same time everybody else is. It's an even playing field in a casual environment—where everybody shares all of that bubbling energy and excitement around a new <em>Magic</em> set!</p>

<p>When I was just eleven, I visited my first Prerelease. I instantly fell in love with them and never looked back. Fifteen years later, not much has changed!</p>

<p>Prereleases are great because the set is brand new, the footing is fairly equal as everybody plays with the set for the very first time, and you're all just relaxing and having fun exploring the new cards. It's just a lot of fun! Even players who have been playing since the beginning of the game look forward to each Prerelease.</p>

<p>If you're a Sealed Deck veteran, you may want to skip ahead to the next section where I talk about some of the differences you can expect at your local store for <em>Aether Revolt</em>. But if you're new to the wide world of Sealed Decks, or are maybe just looking for a few extra pointers, then read on!</p>

<p>All right. So let's go over perhaps the most important part: finding a place to play a Prerelease! After all, you can't very well play if you don't know where to go. How might you go about that?</p>

<p>Well, if you don't already have a local shop you frequent, be sure to check out the <a href="http://locator.wizards.com/" target="_blank">store locator</a> to find one near you! That store may even offer preregistration. Prereleases are some of the most popular events we put on, so be sure to check and see if the store preregisters. The best time to find out an event is full is decidedly <em>not</em> when you show up and learn you can't play, so be sure to look ahead.</p>

<p>So you've found your store. Excellent!</p>

<p>Now it's time to prepare for the <em>Aether Revolt</em>. While you will be building your deck for the event with cards you're given when you get there, there's plenty to do besides just that.</p>

<p>Be sure to pack all the supplies you need to properly prepare for your revolt! For example, you may still want to bring a Standard deck to play for fun between rounds, a trade binder, pen and paper to keep track of life, and even a water bottle. A Prerelease event tends to take about 4–5 hours, so make sure to set aside enough time for the entire event. And you're going to need some fuel with all of that battling, so you may want to bring something like a granola bar or apple as well to snack on. (You may want to check with the local store as well; they might even sell some food there!)</p>

<p>Okay now, let's see. You have a store targeted to visit, and you've filled your pack with everything you'll need. You've even read through the recent <a href="http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/columns/magic-story" target="_blank"><em>Magic</em> Story</a>, so you're up to date on <em>Magic</em> lore. And, of course, you've taken a look at the <a href="/node/1108031" target="_blank"><em>Aether Revolt</em> Card Image Gallery</a>.</p>

<p>You're all set! Now it's time to actually go and open up some of those cards!</p>

<h1>Arming Yourself</h1>

<p>When you head into the Prerelease and sit down to play, you'll be handed a deck box containing everything you need to build your deck. Take a look!</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="" src="http://media.wizards.com/2016/images/daily/aGkWFYOc1b.png" /></p>

<p>Everything you will be playing with comes right in the box—plus a lovely Spindown d20 you'll get to walk away with:</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="" src="http://media.wizards.com/2016/images/daily/WObPdSbiVF.png" /></p>

<p>Now there's still one major element I haven't covered yet, which may actually be the most crucial: deck building! So prepare yourself, because it's time to...</p>

<h1>Invent, Invent, Invent!</h1>

<p>Most important out of everything inside your Prerelease pack are the six booster packs that will give you the cards you need to build your Sealed deck, plus your shiny bonus Prerelease card (which could be any rare or mythic rare in the set!).</p>

<p>First things first: crack open those booster packs! Then, you'll have a stack of cards.</p>

<p>So...what now?</p>

<p>It's time to build your deck, of course!</p>

<p>Sealed deck building is a little different from normal deck building. You get to build a deck only using the cards in front of you, plus as many basic lands as you'd like. Also, unlike a normal Constructed deck where the minimum deck size is 60, you only have to play 40 cards.</p>

<p>The first thing you're going to want to do is figure out a method to pick which colors you'll be playing. I recommend playing two colors.</p>

<p>Some things that may draw you into specific colors are:</p>

<ul>
    <li>A really strong rare you're excited about</li>
    <li>Plenty of "removal" cards that can deal with your opponent's creatures</li>
    <li>A lot of playable cards in that color</li>
    <li>A good "mana curve" in that color—meaning lots of creatures of different costs</li>
</ul>

<p>Ideally, the colors you pick will have all four, but if two or three of those are true, that's plenty good.</p>

<p>Whatever your method, you're going to need to narrow down what you're playing. If you get stuck at the Prerelease, feel free to ask the players around you for help. (You are allowed to do this at a Prerelease—everyone is there to make sure it's a fun event!)</p>

<p>Now you have your colors down. From there, how do you take everything you have and figure out which 22–23 cards you're going to want to put in your deck?</p>

<p>Here's one process that may help!</p>

<p>First, lay your creatures out in mana-cost order. This helps you see what creatures you're going to potentially have to cast at each part of the game. (Don't lay your noncreatures out at this point unless they're cards you are planning to play as soon as you have that much mana—for example, you will generally cast a Metalspinner's Puzzleknot on turn two, whereas Harnessed Lightning isn't usually a turn-two play.)</p>

<p>A good "mana curve" of creatures is crucial to a successful Sealed Deck. You don't want to have a ton of cards at any single spot in the curve. It's important for you to be able to have a good mix so you can play your cheap spells in the early game and your expensive spells in the late game. As a very general rule for Limited, I would look to play something like this:</p>

<ul>
    <li>1 mana: 0–2 creatures</li>
    <li>2 mana: 4–6 creatures</li>
    <li>3 mana: 3–5 creatures</li>
    <li>4 mana: 4 creatures</li>
    <li>5 mana: 3 creatures</li>
    <li>6+ mana: 1–2 creatures</li>
</ul>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="" src="http://media.wizards.com/2016/images/daily/sealed-curve.png" /></p>

<p>That's far from hard and fast, but it's a good place to start. Cull your creatures down to these numbers by choosing your favorites.</p>

<p>Now that you have your core creature base figured out, it's time to add in spells! Pick your favorites among your colors to bring your deck to 22 or 23 cards, and then you're good to go from the spell side.</p>

<p>The spells you're going to want the most are what are called "removal spells"—these are the spells that permanently neutralize your opponent's creatures by either dealing damage, keeping them tapped, or just straight-up destroying them. Sealed Deck <em>Magic</em> is all about creatures, so you'll want to play most of the cards in your colors that can get rid of your opponent's creatures.</p>

<p><em>Aether Revolt</em> (and all of <em>Kaladesh</em> block, for that matter) is particularly interesting in that it has a high number of artifacts compared to a typical <em>Magic</em> set! You're going to have more artifact options that normal. Unless these are also creatures, they should be counting with your noncreature spells—so narrow it down to the ones you really want to be playing with.</p>

<p>Additionally, Vehicles will be in both your <em>Aether Revolt</em> and <em>Kaladesh</em> booster packs! These are sort of like creatures—but you also need additional creatures to be able to crew them. If you play a couple Vehicles you can treat them like creatures for your creature count, but be wary of playing too many lest you end up with a board full of Vehicles and nothing to drive them! (Curious on diving more into this? I wrote some good rules for driving down the streets of <em>Kaladesh</em> in "<a href="http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/beyond-basics/kaladesh-drivers-ed-2016-10-06" target="_blank">Kaladesh Drivers Ed</a>.")</p>

<p>Interested in more tips? Here are a few more things to keep in mind for deck building:</p>

<ul>
    <li>You can play more than 40 cards, but you really should stick to 40 if you can. Every card you play past 40 just means it's that much less likely you're going to draw that awesome rare you put in your deck!</li>
    <li>The land ratio you're looking at should be about 17 lands to 23 nonlands. This isn't right 100% of the time, but most Limited decks end up looking like this, and, in general, it's what I would want to have.</li>
    <li>Play a mix of cheap-to-cast and expensive-to-cast cards. If you have all cheap, small creatures, then a single big creature can shut you down. Likewise if you have all expensive, large creatures, you risk getting run over first. Stick to a mix that focuses on the two-, three-, four-, and five-casting cost creatures. More games of Sealed Deck are won by casting a creature every turn starting on turn two or three than any other way.</li>
    <li>Evasion is important! Often, Sealed Deck games will get into stalls where both players have a lot of creatures and neither player can attack very well. Creatures with abilities like flying ensure that you can break through these creature stalls.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Two-Headed Giant</strong></p>

<p>Some stores also support a version of Sealed Deck called Two-Headed Giant (often abbreviated "2HG"), where two players team up against another pairs of players. Each pair gets two Prerelease boxes from which the players build their decks.</p>

<p>How does it work?</p>

<p>Well, the simple version is this: you and your teammate work together to build two 40-card decks. Then, you play against another pair of players in a one-game match.</p>

<p>How does this kind of multiplayer break down? It's simple: all of your creatures and lands are separate, but you each share the same 30-point life total, and take your turns simultaneously—plus you can block for each other, too! To do the best you can, you'll need to work together to overcome the opposition.</p>

<p>Another really fun part of Two-Headed Giant is discovering which cards work even better in 2HG! For example, take Spireside Infiltrator.</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><auto-card>Spireside Infiltrator</auto-card></p>

<p>When this creature becomes tapped—perhaps from crewing a Vehicle or attacking—it deals 1 damage to each of your opponents. That's 2 damage to their combined 30 life total! Bam!</p>

<h1>Open Dueling</h1>

<p>If the idea of spending a day playing a tournament doesn't fit into how you prefer to play <em>Magic</em>, or if you have less time and just want to experience the excitement of <em>Aether Revolt</em> on your own schedule, you can get involved in Open Dueling!</p>

<p>You get a ready-to-play 60-card Planeswalker Deck and use it to do battle against others participating in Open Dueling, including players participating in the main tournament who are between rounds! This is a great way to dip your toe into the water if you aren't sure the Prerelease is something you want to do or if you can't commit 5 hours to a Prerelease event. You can just play games in Open Dueling at your own leisure. Plus, it's fun!</p>

<p>Ask your local store about Open Dueling at the Prerelease, and prepare to battle!</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="478" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cP-2txz0F48" width="850"></iframe></p>

<p>You've never quite seen a world like Amonkhet before. Inspired by ancient Egypt at its height, and showcasing some of the strongest warriors around, Amonkhet is a mix of serenity and brutality; awe-inspiring pyramids sitting right next to stunning blows in battle. Only the strong can succeed here. Are you up to the challenge?</p>

<p>Because if so, it's time to take you through the five trials—at your friendly local Prerelease, of course!</p>

<p>So where exactly is a Prerelease, and what exactly should you be expecting at one? Read on!</p>

<h1>A Pyramid of Prereleases</h1>

<p>It doesn't get much better than a Prerelease.</p>

<p>No matter where in the world I am or what time of year it is, I always try to go check out a local Prerelease. And I'm not alone: many veteran <em>Magic</em> players will do the same.</p>

<p>Why? Prereleases are some of the most fun you can have playing <em>Magic</em>!</p>

<p>You get to sit down, pick up some brand-new cards, and figure out how you want to use them at the same time as everybody else. It's an even playing field in a casual environment—where everybody shares all of that bubbling energy and excitement around a new <em>Magic</em> set!</p>

<p>I visited my first Prerelease when I was just eleven and instantly fell in love with them. Fifteen years later, not much has changed!</p>

<p>Prereleases are great because the set is brand new, the footing is fairly equal as everybody plays with the set for the very first time, and you're all just relaxing and having fun exploring the new cards. It's a lot of fun for players old and new alike!</p>

<p>If you're a Sealed Deck veteran, you may want to skip ahead to the next section where I talk about some of the differences you can expect at your local store for <em>Amonkhet</em>. But if you're new to the wide world of Sealed Deck or are maybe just looking for a few extra pointers, then read on!</p>

<p>Alright. Let's go over perhaps the most important part: finding a place to play a Prerelease! After all, you can't very well play if you don't know where to go. How might you go about that?</p>

<p>Well, if you don't already have a local shop you frequent, be sure to check out the <a href="http://locator.wizards.com/" target="_blank">store locator</a> to find one near you! That store may even offer preregistration. Prereleases are some of the most popular events we put on, so be sure to check to see if the store preregisters. The best time to find out an event is full is decidedly <em>not</em> when you show up and learn you can't play, so be sure to look ahead.</p>

<p>So, you've found your store. Excellent!</p>

<p>Now it's time to prepare for your trip to Amonkhet. While you will be building your deck for the event with cards you're given when you get there, there's plenty to do beside just that.</p>

<p>Be sure to pack all the supplies you'll need to properly survive the plane! For example, you may still want to bring a Standard deck to play for fun between rounds, a trade binder, pen and paper to keep track of life, and even a water bottle. (You might get thirsty out there in the desert!)</p>

<p>A Prerelease event tends to take about 4–5 hours, so make sure to set aside enough time for the entire event. And you're going to need some fuel with all of that battling, so you may want to bring something like a granola bar or apple as well to snack on. (You may want to check with the local store as well; they might even sell some food there!)</p>

<p>Okay now, let's see. You have a store picked to visit, and you've filled your pack with everything you'll need. You've even read through the recent <a href="http://magic.wizards.com/en/products/amonkhet/story" target="_blank"><em>Magic</em> Story</a>, so you're up to date on <em>Magic</em> lore. And, of course, you've taken a look at the <a href="http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/card-image-gallery/amonkhet" target="_blank"><em>Amonkhet</em> Card Image Gallery</a>.</p>

<p>You're all set! Now it's time to actually go and open up some of those cards!</p>

<h1>Face your Trials</h1>

<p>When you head into the Prerelease and sit down to play, you'll be handed this thing of beauty! Check out the sweet deck box for this time around.</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="" src="http://media.wizards.com/2017/images/daily/SBjMa1SCbX.png" /></p>

<p>Ah, gorgeous, right?</p>

<p>You'll find a couple things inside. For example, this lovely "lazotep" spindown D20 that's a bit different than your standard fare:</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="" src="http://media.wizards.com/2017/images/daily/nwFBYEN479.png" /></p>

<p>And, very importantly, you'll also get one of these. Feast your eyes on the card that describes the Five Trials of Amonkhet!</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="" src="http://media.wizards.com/2017/images/daily/43qIOu7Q6L.png" /></p>

<p>Hey, look at that, you can complete the Trial of Strength just by playing in the event! That was easy. Prepare to cross that one off!&nbsp;Your reward for this is already included in your prerelease box: that is the lovely "lazotep" spindown D20 we mentioned earlier.</p>

<p>Take a gander at some of those other ones too. This is a good time to note that if you bring a friend to the Prerelease, that counts as completing the Trial of Solidarity! Do so, and you can scoop up a lovely lazotep D4 (a pyramid-shaped die, get it?) for your friendship.</p>

<p>Still, it doesn't hurt to prepare for your Trials. Throughout this week on our social media channels, we're going to be helping you train for the Trials with some Puzzles. If you complete all five Training Puzzles, starting with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MagicTheGathering.apac/posts/1337043716364486" target="_blank">the Training Puzzle of Solidarity&nbsp;from yesterday</a>, you can bring in your results to receive a premium full-art basic land that I'm sure will be a nice addition to your collection. Check it out in all its glory:</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="" src="http://media.wizards.com/2017/images/daily/LYxbMur2LS.png" /></p>

<p>Just like on Amonkhet, completing your Trials is full of rewards! Follow along with them and receive our bounty.</p>

<p>Of course, there is one trial that comes up in every <em>Magic</em> Prerelease that's still ever-present, needing to be defeated. And that's . . .</p>

<h1>The Trial of Deck Building</h1>

<p>Most important of everything inside your Prerelease pack are the six booster packs that will give you the cards you need to build your Sealed deck, plus your shiny bonus Prerelease card (which could be any rare or mythic rare in the set!)</p>

<p>First things first: crack open those booster packs! Then, you'll have a stack of cards.</p>

<p>So . . . what now?</p>

<p>It's time to build your deck, of course!</p>

<p>Sealed Deck is a little different from normal deck building. You get to build a deck only using the cards in front of you, plus as many basic lands as you'd like. Also, unlike a normal Constructed deck where the minimum deck size is 60, you only have to play 40 cards.</p>

<p>The first thing you're going to want to do is figure out a method to pick which colors you'll be playing. I recommend playing two colors.</p>

<p>Some things that may draw you into specific colors are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A really strong rare you're excited about</li>
	<li>Plenty of "removal" cards that can deal with your opponent's creatures</li>
	<li>A lot of playable cards in that color</li>
	<li>A good "mana curve" in that color—meaning lots of creatures of different costs</li>
</ul>

<p>Ideally, the colors you pick will have all four, but if two or three of those are true, that's plenty good.</p>

<p>Whatever your method, you're going to need to narrow down what you're playing. If you get stuck at the Prerelease, feel free to ask the players around you for help. (You are allowed to do this at a Prerelease—everyone is there to make sure it's a fun event!)</p>

<p>But whatever your method, now you have your colors down. From there, how do you take everything you have and figure out which 22–23 cards you're going to want to put in your deck?</p>

<p>Here's one process that may help!</p>

<p>First, lay your creatures out in mana-cost order. This helps you see what creatures you're going to potentially have to cast at each part of the game. (Don't lay your noncreatures out at this point unless they're cards you are planning to play as soon as you have that much mana—for example, you will generally cast a Watchful Naga on turn three, whereas Pull from Tomorrow isn't usually a turn-three play.)</p>

<p>A good "mana curve" of creatures is crucial to a successful Sealed Deck. You don't want to have a ton of cards at any single spot in the curve. It's important for you to be able to have a good mix so you can play your cheap spells in the early game and your expensive spells in the late game. As a very general rule for Limited, I would look to play something like this:</p>

<ul>
	<li>1 mana: 0–2 creatures</li>
	<li>2 mana: 4–6 creatures</li>
	<li>3 mana: 3–5 creatures</li>
	<li>4 mana: 4 creatures</li>
	<li>5 mana: 3 creatures</li>
	<li>6+ mana: 1–2 creatures</li>
</ul>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="" src="http://media.wizards.com/2016/images/daily/sealed-curve.png" /></p>

<p>That's far from hard and fast, but it's a good place to start. Cull your creatures down to these numbers by choosing your favorites.</p>

<p>Now that you have your core creature base figured out, it's time to add in spells! Pick your favorites among your colors to bring your deck to 22 or 23 cards, and then you're good to go from the spell side.</p>

<p>The spells you're going to want the most are what are called "removal spells"—these are the spells that permanently neutralize your opponent's creatures by either dealing damage, keeping them tapped, or just straight-up destroying them. Sealed Deck <em>Magic</em> is all about creatures, so you'll want to play most of the cards in your colors that can get rid of your opponent's creatures.</p>

<p>Interested in more tips? Here are a few more things to keep in mind for deck building:</p>

<ul>
	<li>You can play more than 40 cards, but you really should stick to 40 if you can. Every card you play past 40 just means it's that much less likely you're going to draw that awesome rare you put in your deck!</li>
	<li>The land ratio you're looking at should be about seventeen lands to 23 nonlands. This isn't right 100% of the time, but most Limited decks end up looking like this, and, in general, it's what I would want to have.</li>
	<li>Play a mix of cheap-to-cast and expensive-to-cast cards. If you have all cheap, small creatures, then a single big creature can shut you down. Likewise, if you have all expensive, large creatures, you risk getting run over first. Stick to a mix that focuses on the two-, three-, four-, and five-casting cost creatures. More games of Sealed Deck are won by casting a creature every turn starting on turn two or three than any other way.</li>
	<li>Evasion is important! Often, Sealed Deck games will get into stalls where both players have a lot of creatures and neither player can attack very well. Creatures with abilities like flying ensure that you can break through these creature stalls.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Two-Headed Giant</h1>

<p>Some stores also support a version of Sealed Deck called Two-Headed Giant (often abbreviated "2HG") where two players team up against other pairs of players. Each pair gets two Prerelease boxes from which the players build their decks.</p>

<p>How does it work?</p>

<p>Well, the simple version is this: You and your teammate work together to build two 40-card decks. Then, you play against another pair of players in a one-game match.</p>

<p>How does this kind of multiplayer play out? It's simple: all your creatures and lands are separate, but you each share the same 30-point life total and take your turns simultaneously—plus you can block for each other, too! To do the best you can, you'll need to work together to overcome the opposition.</p>

<h1>Open Dueling</h1>

<p>If the idea of spending a day playing a tournament doesn't fit into how you prefer to play <em>Magic</em>, or if you have a crowded schedule and just want to experience the excitement of <em>Amonkhet</em> on your own time, you can get involved in Open Dueling!</p>

<p>You get a ready-to-play 60-card Intro Pack and use it to do battle against others participating in Open Dueling, including players participating in the main tournament who are between rounds! This is a great way to dip your toe into the water if you aren't sure the Prerelease is something you want to do or if you can't commit 5 hours to a Prerelease event. You can just play games in Open Dueling at your own leisure. Plus, it's fun!</p>

<p>Ask your local store about Open Dueling at the Prerelease, and prepare to battle!</p>

<h1>The Hour of Prereleases</h1>

<p>Prereleases are some of the best <em>Magic</em> events of them all.</p>

<p>You'll find a couple things inside. For example, this lovely spindown D20:</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="" src="http://media.wizards.com/2017/images/daily/4WOuMWEA5S.png" /></p>

<p>And, very importantly, you'll also get one of these. It's time to unleash the five Hours!</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="" src="http://media.wizards.com/2017/images/daily/vkghgPYP3C.png" /></p>

<p>Remember the Five Trials from <em>Amonkhet</em>? Well, now they're here in their twisted, Bolas forms: the cruel Five Hours! You can accomplish these over the course of the next few weeks. And just by playing in the event, you'll have already completed the Hour of Revelation!</p>

<p>Complete these Hours, and you'll receive wonderful prizes befitting of a God-Pharaoh. Check these out:</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="" src="http://media.wizards.com/2017/images/daily/AaESOnMwQM.png" /></p>

<p>And speaking of prizes, on top of all that gorgeous bounty, there are still matches to be played—and perhaps some booster packs to be won! So now it's time to turn our sights to the cards themselves.</p>

<h1>Unleash Your Scheme</h1>

<p>Most important of everything inside your Prerelease pack are the six booster packs that will give you the cards you need to build your Sealed deck, plus your shiny bonus Prerelease card—which could be any rare or mythic rare in the set!</p>

<p>First things first: crack open those booster packs! Then, you'll have a stack of cards.</p>

<p>So . . . what now?</p>

<p>It's time to build your deck, of course!</p>

<p>Sealed Deck is a little different from normal deck building. You get to build a deck only using the cards in front of you, plus as many basic lands as you'd like. Also, unlike a normal Constructed deck where the minimum deck size is 60, you only have to play 40 cards.</p>

<p>The first thing you're going to want to do is figure out a method to pick which colors you'll be playing. I recommend playing two colors.</p>

<p>Some things that may draw you into specific colors are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A really strong rare you're excited about</li>
	<li>Plenty of "removal" cards that can deal with your opponent's creatures</li>
	<li>A lot of playable cards in that color</li>
	<li>A good "mana curve" in that color—meaning lots of creatures of different costs</li>
</ul>

<p>Ideally, the colors you pick will have all four, but if two or three of those are true that's plenty good.</p>

<p>Whatever your method, you're going to need to narrow down what you're playing. If you get stuck at the Prerelease, feel free to ask the players around you for help. (You are allowed to do this at a Prerelease—everyone is there to make sure it's a fun event!)</p>

<p>Now you have your colors down. From there, how do you take everything you have and figure out which 22–23 cards you're going to want to put in your deck?</p>

<p>Here's one process that may help!</p>

<p>First, lay your creatures out in mana-cost order. This helps you see what creatures you're going to potentially have to cast at each part of the game. (Don't lay your noncreatures out at this point unless they're cards you are planning to play as soon as you have that much mana—for example, you will generally cast a [autocard]Watchful Naga[/autocard] on turn three whereas [autocard]Pull from Tomorrow[/autocard] isn't usually a turn-three play.)</p>

<p>A good "mana curve" of creatures is crucial to a successful Sealed Deck. You don't want to have a ton of cards at any single spot in the curve. It's important for you to be able to have a good mix so you can play your cheap spells in the early game and your expensive spells in the late game. As a very general rule for Limited, I would look to play something like this:</p>

<ul>
	<li>1&nbsp;mana: 0–2</li>
	<li>2&nbsp;mana: 4–6</li>
	<li>3&nbsp;mana: 3–5</li>
	<li>4&nbsp;mana: 2–4</li>
	<li>5&nbsp;mana: 1–3</li>
	<li>6+ mana: 0–2</li>
</ul>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="" src="http://media.wizards.com/2017/images/daily/BB20170525_New-curve.png" /></p>

<p>That's far from a hard-and-fast rule, but it's a good place to start. Cull your creatures down to these numbers by choosing your favorites.</p>

<p>Now that you have your core creature base figured out, it's time to add in spells! Pick your favorites among your colors to bring your deck to 22 or 23 cards, and then you're good to go from the spell side.</p>

<p>The spells you're going to want the most are what are called "removal spells"—these are the spells that permanently neutralize your opponent's creatures by either dealing damage, keeping them tapped, or just straight-up destroying them. Sealed Deck <em>Magic</em> is all about creatures, so you'll want to play most of the cards in your colors that can get rid of your opponent's creatures.</p>

<p>If you want to learn more about mana curves, you can also check out my article on how to build a mana curve by clicking <a href="http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/beyond-basics/how-build-mana-curve-2017-05-18" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>Interested in more tips? Here are a few more things to keep in mind for deck building:</p>

<ul>
	<li>You can play more than 40 cards, but you really should stick to 40 if you can. Every card you play past 40 just means it's that much less likely you're going to draw that awesome rare you put in your deck!</li>
	<li>The land ratio you're looking at should be about seventeen lands to 23 nonlands. This isn't right 100% of the time, but most Limited decks end up looking like this, and in general, it's what I would want to have.</li>
	<li>Play a mix of cheap-to-cast and expensive-to-cast cards. If you have all cheap, small creatures, then a single big creature can shut you down. Likewise if you have all expensive, large creatures, you risk getting run over first. Stick to a mix that focuses on the two-, three-, four-, and five-casting-cost creatures. More games of Sealed Deck are won by casting a creature every turn starting on turn two or three than any other way.</li>
	<li>Evasion is important! Often, Sealed Deck games will get into stalls where both players have a lot of creatures and neither player can attack very well. Creatures with abilities like flying ensure that you can break through these creature stalls.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Two-Headed Giant</h1>

<p>Some stores also support a version of Sealed Deck called Two-Headed Giant (often abbreviated "2HG") where two players team up against other pairs of players. Each pair gets two Prerelease boxes from which the players build their decks.</p>

<p>How does it work?</p>

<p>Well, the simple version is this: you and your teammate work together to build two 40-card decks. Then, you play against another pair of players in a one-game match.</p>

<p>How does this kind of multiplayer play out? It's simple: all your creatures and lands are separate, but you each share the same 30-point life total and take your turns simultaneously—plus you can block for each other too! To do the best you can, you'll need to work together to overcome the opposition.</p>

<p>Curious to learn more about how 2HG works and some of the intricacies of play? Be sure to check out the page all about it by clicking <a href="http://magic.wizards.com/en/gameinfo/gameplay/formats/twoheadedgiant" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<h1>Open Dueling</h1>

<p>If the idea of spending a whole day playing a tournament doesn't fit into how you prefer to play <em>Magic</em>, or if you have less time and just want to experience the excitement of <em>Hour of Devastation</em> on your own time, you can get involved in Open Dueling!</p>

<p>You get a ready-to-play 60-card Intro Pack and use it to do battle against others participating in Open Dueling, including players participating in the main tournament who are between rounds! This is a great way to dip your toe into the water if you aren't sure the Prerelease is something you want to do or if you can't commit 5 hours to a Prerelease event. You can just play games in Open Dueling at your own leisure. Plus, it's fun!</p>

<p>Ask your local store about Open Dueling at the Prerelease, and prepare to battle!</p>

<h1><em>Hour of Devastation</em> Mechanics</h1>

<p><em>Hour of Devastation</em> is full of ways to crush your opponents! Or as we call them in R&amp;D, new mechanics. You should definitely check out the <a href="http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/hour-devastation-mechanics-2017-06-16" target="_blank">mechanics article</a> to get a full sense of what's going on—or, for&nbsp;shorter bite-size versions, check out these videos that cover the mechanics in depth:</p>

<h1>The Hour Is Now</h1>

<p>With Nicol Bolas at the height of his power, it's the perfect time to try and grab some of that power for yourself! The <em>Hour of Devastation</em> Prerelease is just around the corner. Take another look through the <a href="http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/card-image-gallery/hour-devastation" target="_blank">Card Image Gallery</a>, make sure you're preregistered at your <a href="http://locator.wizards.com/" target="_blank">local store</a>, and get ready to come out to the Prerelease and have a blast!</p>

<p>That just about covers our path to the Prerelease! Go forth and have fun.</p>

Hold on tight, because a world of Dinosaurs, Pirates, Merfolk, and Vampires is fresh on the horizon!</p>

<p>Take a look for yourself:</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="" src="http://media.wizards.com/2017/images/daily/Dj3B2o9Pjz.jpg" /></p>

<p>Four tribes. A quest for a mysterious Golden City. Endless opportunities for adventure. And, of course, what's an adventure without some sweet loot to earn along the way?</p>

<p>In <em>Magic</em>, there's one best kind of loot: new cards!</p>

<p>The best place to check out these brand-new cards is the Prerelease. So where exactly is a Prerelease, and what exactly should you be expecting at one? Read on!</p>

<h1>Journey to the Prerelease</h1>

<p>Prereleases are my favorite <em>Magic</em> events of the year.</p>

<p>No matter where in the world I am or what time of year it is, I always try and go check out a local Prerelease. And I'm not alone: tons of <em>Magic</em> players, from seasoned veterans to brand-new players, do the same! Prereleases are among the most popular events we throw.</p>

<p>Why? Because Prereleases are just some of the most fun you can have playing <em>Magic</em>!</p>

<p>You get to sit down, pick up some brand-new cards, and figure out how you want to use them at the same time everybody else is. It's an even playing field in a casual environment—where everybody shares all that bubbling energy and excitement around a new <em>Magic</em> set!</p>

<p>I visited my first Prerelease when I was just eleven and instantly fell in love with them. Sixteen years later, not much has changed!</p>

<p>Prereleases are great because the set is brand new, the footing is fairly equal as everybody plays with the set for the very first time, and you're all just relaxing and having fun exploring the new cards. It's a lot of fun for players old and new alike!</p>

<p>If you're a Sealed Deck veteran, you may want to skip ahead to the next section where I talk about some of the differences you can expect at your local store for <em>Ixalan</em>. But if you're new to the wide world of Sealed Deck or are maybe just looking for a few extra pointers, then read on!</p>

<p>All right. So let's go over perhaps the most important part: finding a place to play a Prerelease! After all, you can't very well play if you don't know where to go. How might you go about that?</p>

<p>If you don't already have a local shop you frequent, be sure to check out the <a href="http://locator.wizards.com/" target="_blank">store locator</a> to find one near you! That store may even offer preregistration. Prereleases are some of the most popular events we put on, so be sure to check and see if the store preregisters. The best time to find out an event is full is decidedly not when you show up and learn you can't play, so be sure to look ahead.</p>

<p>So you've found your store. Excellent! And you didn't even have to follow any convoluted treasure maps to get there.</p>

<p>Now it's time to explore ahead and prepare for the event. While you will be building your deck for the event with cards you're given when you get there, there's plenty to do besides just that.</p>

<p>Be sure to pack all the supplies you will need for your sojourn into the wild world of <em>Ixalan</em>! For example, you may still want to bring a Standard deck to play for fun between rounds, a trade binder, pen and paper to keep track of life, and even a water bottle.</p>

<p>A Prerelease event tends to take about 4–5 hours, so make sure to set aside enough time for the entire event. And you're going to need some fuel with all that battling, so you may want to bring something like a granola bar or apple as well to snack on. (You may want to check with the local store as well; they might even sell some food there!)</p>

<p>Okay now, let's see. You have a store selected on your map (I see that X marks the spot—I like your style!) and you've filled your pack with everything you'll need. You've even read through the recent <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/products/ixalan#story" target="_blank"><em>Magic</em> Story</a>, so you're up to date on <em>Magic</em> lore. And, of course, you've taken a look at all the awesome cards in the <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/card-image-gallery/ixalan" target="_blank"><em>Ixalan</em> Card Image Gallery</a>. Perhaps, if you were curious what a tournament might be like, you might have checked out my article helpfully titled "<a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/beyond-basics/your-first-tournament-2017-02-23" target="_blank">Your First Tournament</a>."</p>

<p>You're all set! Now it's time to actually go and open up some of those cards!</p>

<h1>Opening your Treasure</h1>

<p>When you head into the Prerelease and sit down to play, you'll be handed this wonderful item! Check out the sweet deck box this time around:</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="" src="http://media.wizards.com/2017/images/daily/PQmrpg2bwp.png" /></p>

<p>A fine treasure chest full of <em>Ixalan</em> goodies, indeed!</p>

<p>You'll find a couple things inside. For example, this lovely spindown D20:</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="" src="http://media.wizards.com/2017/images/daily/qS0r3zIB0T.png" /></p>

<p>You can expect an insert telling you a little about the world of Ixalan.</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="" src="http://media.wizards.com/2017/images/daily/nppeZg4aRB.png" /></p>

<p>But most importantly of everything inside your Prerelease pack are the six booster packs that will give you the cards you need to build your Sealed deck, plus your shiny bonus Prerelease card. (Which could be any rare or mythic rare in the set!)</p>

<p>First thing's first: crack open those booster packs! Then, you'll have a stack of cards.</p>

<p>So&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. what now?</p>

<p>It's time to build your deck, of course!</p>

<p>Sealed Deck is a little different from normal deck building. You get to build a deck only using the cards in front of you, plus as many basic lands as you'd like. Also, unlike a normal Constructed deck where the minimum deck size is 60, you only have to play 40 cards.</p>

<p>The first thing you're going to want to do is figure out a method to pick which colors you'll be playing. I recommend playing two colors.</p>

<p>Some things that may draw you into specific colors are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A really strong rare you're excited about;</li>
	<li>Plenty of "removal" cards that can deal with your opponent's creatures;</li>
	<li>A lot of playable cards in that color; and</li>
	<li>A good "mana curve" in that color—meaning lots of creatures of different costs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ideally, the colors you pick will have all four of those aspects, but if two or three of those are true that's plenty good.</p>

<p>One key aspect of <em>Ixalan</em> is that it's a "tribal" set. Tribal means that the creature types matter here! There are four primary tribes, each centered in specific colors:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Dinosaurs (appearing in red, green, and white);</li>
	<li>Merfolk (appearing in green and blue);</li>
	<li>Pirates (appearing in blue, black, and red); and</li>
	<li>Vampires (appearing in white and black).</li>
</ul>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="" src="http://media.wizards.com/2017/images/daily/PX9njJZPUZ.png" style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;" /><img alt="" src="http://media.wizards.com/2017/images/daily/CMK6gaWGqj.png" style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;" /></p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="" src="http://media.wizards.com/2017/images/daily/MhluWh5KkR.png" style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;" /><img alt="" src="http://media.wizards.com/2017/images/daily/mMSi2WsdEz.png" style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;" /></p>

<p>If in doubt, you will probably be just fine picking a tribe to help narrow down your choices! If you pick one of the tribes that span three colors, I'd recommend narrowing down to two of those three colors unless you have cards that help you fix your mana colors.</p>

<p>I will note that you don't <em>need</em> to play a tribe, and if you don't want to, don't feel beholden to. It's just one method—there are plenty of non-tribal strategies as well.</p>

<p>Whatever your method, you're going to need to narrow down what you're playing. If you get stuck at the Prerelease, feel free to ask the players around you for help. (You are allowed to do this at a Prerelease—everyone is there to make sure it's a fun event!)</p>

<p>Now you have your colors down. From there, how do you take everything you have and figure out which 22–23 cards you're going to want to put in your deck?</p>

<p>Here's one process that may help!</p>

<p>First, lay your creatures out in mana-cost order. This helps you see what creatures you're going to potentially have to cast at each part of the game. (Don't lay your noncreatures out at this point unless they're cards you are planning to play as soon as you have that much mana—for example, you will generally cast a Fathom Fleet Captain on turn two, whereas Walk the Plank isn't usually a turn-two play.)</p>

<p>A good "mana curve" of creatures is crucial to a successful Sealed deck. You don't want to have a disproportionate number of cards at any single spot in the curve. It's important for you to be able to have a good mix so you can play your cheap spells in the early game and your expensive spells in the late game. As a very general rule for Limited, I would look to play something like this:</p>

<ul>
	<li>1 mana: 0–2</li>
	<li>2 mana: 4–6</li>
	<li>3 mana: 3–5</li>
	<li>4 mana: 2–4</li>
	<li>5 mana 1–3</li>
	<li>6+ mana: 0–2</li>
</ul>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="" src="http://media.wizards.com/2017/images/daily/BB20170525_New-curve.png" /></p>

<p>That's far from hard and fast, but it's a good place to start. Cull your creatures down to these numbers by choosing your favorites.</p>

<p>Now that you have your core creature base figured out, it's time to add in spells! Pick your favorites among your colors to bring your deck to 22 or 23 cards, and then you're good to go from the spell side.</p>

<p>The spells you're going to want the most are what are called "removal spells"—these are the spells that permanently neutralize your opponent's creatures by either dealing damage, keeping them tapped, or just straight-up destroying them. Sealed Deck <em>Magic</em> is all about creatures, so you'll want to play most of the cards in your colors that can get rid of your opponent's creatures.</p>

<p>If you want to learn more about mana curves, you can also check out my article on how to build a mana curve by <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/beyond-basics/how-build-mana-curve-2017-05-18" target="_blank">clicking here</a>.</p>

<p>Interested in more tips? Here are a few more things to keep in mind for deck building:</p>

<ul>
	<li>You can play more than 40 cards, but you really should stick to 40 if possible. Every card you play past 40 just means it's that much less likely you're going to draw that awesome rare you put in your deck!</li>
	<li>The land ratio you're looking at should be about seventeen lands to 23 nonlands. This isn't right 100% of the time, but most Limited decks end up looking like this, and in general, it's what I would want to have.</li>
	<li>Play a mix of cheap-to-cast and expensive-to-cast cards. If you have all cheap, small creatures, then a single big creature can shut you down. Likewise, if you have all expensive, large creatures, you risk getting run over before you can cast any of them. Stick to a mix that focuses on the two-, three-, four-, and five-casting cost creatures. More games of Sealed Deck are won by casting a creature every turn starting on turn two or three than any other way.</li>
	<li>Evasion is important! Often, Sealed Deck games will get into stalemates where both players have a lot of creatures and neither player can attack very well. Creatures with abilities like flying ensure that you can break through these creature stalls.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Two-Headed Giant</h1>

<p>Some stores also support a version of Sealed Deck called Two-Headed Giant (often abbreviated "2HG") where two players team up against other pairs of players. Each pair gets two Prerelease kits from which the players build their decks.</p>

<p>How does it work?</p>

<p>Well, you and your teammate work together to build two 40-card decks. Then, you play against another pair of players in a one-game match.</p>

<p>How does this kind of multiplayer play out? It's simple: all your creatures and lands are separate, but you each share the same 30-point life total and take your turns simultaneously—plus you can block for each other too! To do the best you can, you'll need to work together to overcome the opposition.</p>

<p>Curious to learn more about how 2HG works and some of the intricacies of play? Be sure to check out the page all about it by clicking <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/gameplay/formats/two-headed-giant" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<h1>Open Dueling</h1>

<p>If the idea of spending a day playing in a tournament doesn't fit into how you prefer to play <em>Magic</em>, or if you have less time and just want to experience the adventure of <em>Ixalan</em> on your own schedule, you can get involved in Open Dueling!</p>

<p>You get a ready-to-play 60-card Intro Pack and use it to do battle against others participating in Open Dueling, including players participating in the main tournament who are between rounds! This is a great way to dip your toe into the water if you aren't sure the Prerelease is something you want to do or if you can't commit 5 hours to a Prerelease event. You can just play games in Open Dueling at your own leisure. Plus, it's fun!</p>

<p>Ask your local store about Open Dueling at the Prerelease, and prepare to battle!</p>

<p>In addition to the voracious Eldrazi titan Ulamog, the mighty Eldrazi titan and reality-bender Kozilek has emerged and is wreaking havoc on the plane. This tag-team duo of two of the most powerful beings in the entire Multiverse would be enough to shatter any plane.</p>

<p>Alone, Zendikar will fall. Its cities will be devoured and its people will be broken. But together, there is a chance. There is shining crystal of hope in a dimly lit cave.</p>

<p>And that hope is the Gatewatch.</p>

<p>Will you join them?</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img src="http://media.wizards.com/2015/images/daily/lclksRFWxg.jpg" /></p>

<p>It's time to join the Gatewatch by playing in your local Prerelease! After all, what better way to arm yourself against the Eldrazi than by seeing what the set has to offer?</p>

<p>The Prerelease is your first chance to play with the new cards—which means you'll have a leg up on the competition and be able to experience <em>Oath of the Gatewatch</em> before anybody else! It's a great event for anybody, whether you're brand new to the game or a veteran Planeswalker.</p>

<p>What should you expect? Well, let's run through it!</p>

<h1>Take the Oath</h1>

<p>Prereleases are a truly magical time of year.</p>

<p>I've been going to Prereleases since I was eleven years old, and I was instantly hooked. They're great because the set is brand new, the footing is fairly equal as everybody plays with the set for the very first time, and you're all just relaxing and having fun exploring the new cards. It's just a lot of fun! Even players who have been playing since the beginning of the game look forward to each Prerelease like it's a new present they can unwrap.</p>

<p>If you're a Sealed Deck veteran, you may want to skip ahead to the next section, where I talk about some of the differences you can expect at your local store for <em>Oath of the Gatewatch</em>. But if you're new to this whole Sealed Deck shindig, or are maybe just looking for a few extra pointers, then read on!</p>

<p>All right. So let's go over perhaps the most important part: finding a place to play a Prerelease! After all, you can't very well play if you don't know where to go. How might you go about that?</p>

<p>Well, if you don't already have a local shop you frequent, be sure to check out the <a href="http://locator.wizards.com/" target="_blank">store locator</a> to find one near you! That store may even offer preregistration. Prereleases are some of the most popular events we put on, so be sure to check and see if the store preregisters. The best time to find out an event is full is decidedly not when you show up and learn you can't play, so be sure to look ahead.</p>

<p>So you've found your store. Excellent!</p>

<p>Now it's time to prepare. Zendikar is a perilous place to be right now—and you'll want to be ready for whatever comes your way! While you will be building your deck for the event with cards you're given when you get there, there's plenty to do besides just that.</p>

<p>For example, you may still want to bring a Standard or Commander deck to play for fun between rounds, a trade binder, pen and paper to keep track of life, and even a water bottle. Something small to snack on can be a good idea as well, like a granola bar or extra Eldrazi Scions. You can expect a Prerelease event to take about four to five hours, so you'll want to make sure you set aside enough time for the entire event.</p>

<p>Okay now, let's see. You have a store and you've gathered everything you might need to prepare for what's going on on Zendikar. You've even read through the recent <a href="http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/columns/uncharted-realms-archive" target="_blank">Official <em>Magic</em> Fiction</a>, so you're up to date on <em>Magic</em> lore. And, of course, you've taken a look at the <a href="http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/card-image-gallery/oathofthegatewatch" target="_blank"> <em>Oath of the Gatewatch</em> Card Image Gallery </a>.</p>

<p>You're all set! Now it's time for...</p>

<h1>Oathmaking</h1>

<p>When you head into the Prerelease and sit down to play, you'll be handed a deck box containing everything you need to build your deck. Check it out!</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img src="http://media.wizards.com/2016/images/daily/5tTlPIA8GF.png" /></p>

<p>Very similar to the deck boxes you could receive at the <em>Battle for Zendikar</em> Prerelease, these will hold cards just as well. And of course, the contents inside have something very new and important: <em>Oath of the Gatewatch </em>boosters!</p>

<p>Inside this box you'll find a lot of neat things. But most important to your day are going to be the booster packs that will give you the cards you need to build your Sealed deck, plus your shiny bonus Prerelease card. (Which could be any rare or mythic rare in the set!)</p>

<p>First things first: unlock the secrets of the Multiverse. By which I mean rip those packs open! Then, you'll have a stack of cards.</p>

<p>So...what now?</p>

<p>It's time to build your deck, of course!</p>

<p>Sealed Deck is a little different from normal deck building. You get to build a deck only using the cards in front of you, plus as many basic lands as you'd like. Also, unlike a normal Constructed deck where the minimum deck size is 60, you only have to play 40 cards.</p>

<p>The first thing you're going to want to do is figure out a method to pick which colors you'll be playing. I recommend playing two colors. This is a little confusing in this set, because some cards have devoid, which means they don't have a color. But for deck building, treat them as though they have a color—you will still need mana that has a color to cast them!</p>

<p>Some things that may draw you into specific colors are:</p>

<ul>
    <li>A really strong rare you're excited about</li>
    <li>Plenty of "removal" cards that can deal with your opponent's creatures</li>
    <li>A lot of playable cards in that color</li>
    <li>A good "mana curve" in that color—meaning lots of creatures of different costs</li>
</ul>

<p>Ideally, the colors you pick will have all four, but if two or three of those are true that's plenty good.</p>

<p>Whatever your method, you're going to need to narrow down what you're playing. If you get stuck at the Prerelease, take a look at the insert provided inside the Prerelease box for some inspiration, or feel free to ask the players around you for help. (You are allowed to do this at a Prerelease—it's about fun and learning, after all!)</p>

<p>One other tricky thing you can expect to find in the <em>Oath of the Gatewatch</em> set is colorless mana. This is something brand new to this set. It looks like this:</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img src="http://media.wizards.com/2015/ogw_239nCi30ks3/en_yimcAB2Iop.png" style="width:223px" /></p>

<p>This new symbol represents <em>colorless mana</em>. Unlike generic mana costs, which can be paid with any type of mana (like the one in the above mana cost), colorless costs can <em>only</em> be paid with colorless mana. And that means it almost functions like another color, since you need specific mana to cast it.</p>

<p>Mark Rosewater explains the new colorless mana symbol in detail in "<a href="http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/solemn-oath-part-1-2015-12-28" target="_blank">A Solemn Oath, Part 1</a>."</p>

<p>So, when deck building, you will want to make sure to support any colorless cards you play. Of course, you have a new basic land to help you out with this:</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img src="http://media.wizards.com/2015/ogw_239nCi30ks3/en_gv01m85Yqi.png" style="width:223px" /></p>

<p>But, unlike normal basic lands, in Limited formats you can only play with the Wastes that enter your pool (meaning you draft them or open them in packs for Sealed Deck). So, you're going to count on some other cards you get to help you cast these spells.</p>

<p>You're probably going to want at least three to five colorless mana sources to help cast any cards in your deck that require colorless mana to cast (provided you're only playing a few of them). So build wisely. I wouldn't recommend just tossing colorless cards into any deck.</p>

<p>With that said, they are quite powerful, and you should play with them if you have the opportunity. Just know that with great power comes great responsibility.</p>

<p>Okay—so you have your colors down. From there, how do you take everything you have and figure out which 22–23 cards you're going to want to put in your deck? This can look like the step of nightmares when you're looking at a mass of awesome cards—but lose sleep no more: there's a process to help out with this!</p>

<p>First, lay your creatures out in mana-cost order. This helps you see what creatures you're going to potentially have to cast at each part of the game. (Don't lay your noncreatures out at this point unless they're cards you are planning to play as soon as you have that much mana—for example, you will generally cast a <auto-card>Despise</auto-card> on turn one, but <auto-card>Titan's Presence</auto-card> isn't usually a turn-three priority.)</p>

<p>A good "mana curve" of creatures is crucial to a successful Sealed Deck. You don't want to have a ton of cards at any single spot in the curve. It's important for you to be able to have a good mix so you can play your cheap spells in the early game and your expensive spells in the late game. As a very general rule for Limited, I would look to play something like this:</p>

<ul>
    <li>1 mana: 0–2 creatures</li>
    <li>2 mana: 4–6 creatures</li>
    <li>3 mana: 3–5 creatures</li>
    <li>4 mana: 4 creatures</li>
    <li>5 mana: 3 creatures</li>
    <li>6+ mana: 1–2 creatures</li>
</ul>

<p>That's far from hard and fast, but it's a good place to start. Cull your creatures down to these numbers by choosing your favorites.</p>

<p>Now that you have your core creature base figured out, it's time to add in spells! Pick your favorites among your colors to bring your deck to 22 or 23 cards, and then you're good to go from the spell side.</p>

<p>The spells you're going to want the most are what are called "removal spells"—these are the spells that permanently neutralize your opponent's creatures, by either dealing damage, keeping them tapped, or just straight-up destroying them. Sealed Deck <em>Magic</em> is all about creatures, so you'll want to play most of the cards in your colors that can get rid of your opponent's creatures.</p>

<p>Interested in more tips? Here are a few more things to keep in mind for deck building:</p>

<ul>
    <li>You can play more than 40 cards, but you really should stick to 40 if you can. Every card you play past 40 just means it's that much less likely you're going to draw that awesome rare you put in your deck!</li>
    <li>The land ratio you're looking at should be about seventeen lands to 23 nonlands. This isn't right 100% of the time, but most Limited decks end up looking like this, and, in general, it's what I would want to have. On Zendikar in particular, if you have a lot of landfall or lands with special abilities, you may want to consider playing eighteen lands.</li>
    <li>Play a mix of cheap-to-cast and expensive-to-cast cards. If you have all cheap, small creatures, then a single big creature can shut you down. Likewise if you have all expensive, large creatures, you risk getting run over first. Stick to a mix that focuses on the two-, three-, four-, and five-casting cost creatures. More games of Sealed Deck are won by casting a creature every turn starting on turn two or three than any other way.</li>
    <li>Evasion is important! Often, Sealed Deck games will get into stalls where both players have a lot of creatures and neither player can attack very well. Creatures with abilities like flying ensure that you can break through these creature stalls.</li>

<h1>Two-Headed Giant</h1>

<p><em>Oath of the Gatewatch</em> was a set designed with Two-Headed Giant in mind! Just like how Planeswalkers are teaming up to fight their enemies in the story, so too can you and your friend work together at this Prerelease!</p>

<p>Each pair gets two Prerelease boxes, from which your team builds two decks. Then, you play against other Two-Headed Giant teams. You and your teammate take your turns simultaneously, meaning you're really working together!</p>

<p>This is a great opportunity to play side by side with a longtime <em>Magic</em> friend, but it works equally well for someone who's just learning the ropes, considering you'll be there to help them out the whole way.</p>

<p>And best of all, with mechanics like support and surge, Two-Headed Giant this time around is like nothing you've experienced before. Talk to your local store about their Two-Headed Giant Prerelease and preregister to give it a try!</p>

<h1>Open Dueling</h1>

<p>If the idea of spending a day playing a tournament is a little too much, or if you have less time and just want to experience some low-key games with <em>Oath of the Gatewatch</em>, you can get involved in Open Dueling.</p>

<p>In this side event, you get a ready-to-play 60-card Intro Pack and use it to do battle against others participating in Open Dueling, including players participating in the main tournament who are between rounds! This is a great way to dip your toe into the water if you aren't sure the Prerelease is something you want to do, or if you can't commit five hours to a Prerelease event. You can just play games in Open Dueling at your own leisure. Plus, it's fun!</p>

<p>Angels gone mad. Planeswalkers gone rogue. A trail of clues, leading to some much larger mystery...</p>

<p>I think you had better take a look:</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="422" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GopkHUg2XCY" width="750"></iframe></p>

<p>It's not all unicorns and rainbows—in fact, it's <em>exactly</em> not unicorns and rainbows—for the good guys. But Innistrad is far from a lost cause. If you can help solve the mystery of Innistrad, there may still be time to stop this madness yet.</p>

<p>There's only one way to research the depths of Innistrad's insanity—and that's to explore it! And what better way than by playing in a Prerelease? You'll get the cards before anybody else, meet several other investigators like yourself, and even stumble upon an exclusive Prerelease puzzle!</p>

<p>But I'm getting ahead of myself. What all should you expect? Read on.</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="422" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TW-Npd-bjMo" width="750"></iframe></p>

<h1>Unravel the Mystery</h1>

<p>Even when the world is going insane, Prereleases are still some of the most fun you can have playing <em>Magic</em>.</p>

<p>My first Prerelease was when I was eleven years old—and I was instantly hooked. Fourteen years later, I <em>still</em> get excited to visit the Prerelease!</p>

<p>Prereleases are great because the set is brand new, the footing is fairly equal as everybody plays with the set for the very first time, and you're all just relaxing and exploring the new cards. It's just a lot of fun! Even players who have been playing since the beginning of the game look forward to each Prerelease like it's a new present they can unwrap.</p>

<p>If you're a Sealed Deck veteran, you may want to skip ahead to the next section, where I talk about some of the differences you can expect at your local store for <em>Shadows over Innistrad</em>. But if you're new to this whole Sealed Deck shindig, or maybe are just looking for a few extra pointers, read on!</p>

<p>All right. So let's go over perhaps the most important part: finding a place to play a Prerelease! After all, you can't very well play if you don't know where to go. How might you go about that?</p>

<p>Well, if you don't already have a local shop you frequent, be sure to check out the <a href="http://locator.wizards.com/" target="_blank">store locator</a> to find one near you! That store may even offer preregistration. Prereleases are some of the most popular events we put on, so be sure to check and see if the store preregisters. The best time to find out an event is full is decidedly not when you show up and learn you can't play, so be sure to look ahead.</p>

<p>So you've found your store. Excellent!</p>

<p>Now it's time to prepare. Innistrad is somewhere you won't want to walk around unprepared—and you'll need to be ready for whatever comes your way! While you will be building your deck for the event with cards you're given when you get there, there's plenty to do besides just that.</p>

<p>For example, you may still want to bring a Standard or Commander deck to play for fun between rounds, a trade binder, pen and paper to keep track of life, and even a water bottle. Something small to snack on can be a good idea as well, like a granola bar or, if you're a vampire, your goblet of blood. You can expect a Prerelease event to take about four to five hours, so you'll want to make sure you set aside enough time for the entire event.</p>

<p>Okay now, let's see. You have a store and you've gathered everything you might need to prepare for what's happening on Innistrad. You've even read through the recent <a href="http://magic.wizards.com/content/shadows-innistrad-story" target="_blank"><em>Magic</em> Story</a>, so you're up to date on <em>Magic</em> lore. And, of course, you've taken a look at the <em>Shadows over Innistrad</em> <a href="http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/card-image-gallery/shadowsoverinnistrad" target="_blank">Card Image Gallery</a>.</p>

<p>You're all set! Now it's time to...</p>

<h1>Unravel the Boosters</h1>

<p>When you head into the Prerelease and sit down to play, you'll be handed a snazzy new deck box containing everything you need to build your deck. Check it out!</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="" src="http://media.wizards.com/2016/images/daily/pk7QRf0cgm.png" /></p>

<p>This new form factor for <em>Shadows over Innistrad</em> means you'll have your very own replica deck box of Tamiyo's Journal to carry your cards around in. Keep it safe!</p>

<p>Inside the deck box is also a puzzle for you to work out....But it'd be no fun to spoil that for you now, would it? You'll need to go to the Prerelease and work with your fellow sleuths in the store to figure it out for yourself!</p>

<p>But perhaps most important out of all of this will be the six booster packs that will give you the cards you need to build your deck, plus your shiny bonus Prerelease card (which could be any rare or mythic rare in the set!).</p>

<p>First things first: unravel the mystery...of what's in those booster packs! Then, you'll have a stack of cards.</p>

<p>So, what now?</p>

<p>It's time to build your deck, of course!</p>

<p>Sealed Deck is a little different from normal deck building. You get to build a deck using only the cards in front of you, plus as many basic lands as you'd like. Also, unlike a normal Constructed deck where the minimum deck size is 60, you only have to play 40 cards.</p>

<p>The first thing you're going to want to do is figure out a method to pick which colors you'll be playing. I recommend playing two colors.</p>

<p>Some things that may draw you into specific colors are:</p>

<ul>
    <li>A really strong rare you're excited about</li>
    <li>Plenty of "removal" cards that can deal with your opponent's creatures</li>
    <li>A lot of playable cards in that color</li>
    <li>A good "mana curve" in that color—meaning lots of creatures of different costs</li>
</ul>

<p>Ideally, the colors you pick will have all four, but if two or three of those are true that's plenty good.</p>

<p>Whatever your method, you're going to need to narrow down what you're playing. If you get stuck at the Prerelease, feel free to ask the players around you for help. (You are allowed to do this at a Prerelease—even on Innistrad, it's about fun and learning, after all!) If you get stuck, one fun way to decide here is to pick an Innistrad creature type that fits in a color pair, such as Spirits (white-blue), Zombies (blue-black), Vampires (black-red), Werewolves (red-green), or Humans (green-white), and then build around them!</p>

<p>Whatever your method, now you have your colors down. From there, how do you take everything you have and figure out which 22 to 23 cards you're going to want to put in your deck?</p>

<p>Innistrad has many nocturnal terrors—but you don't need to lose sleep anymore over this one: there's a process to help out with that!</p>

<p>First, lay your creatures out in mana-cost order. This helps you see which creatures you're going to potentially have to cast at each part of the game. (Don't lay your noncreatures out at this point unless they're cards you are planning to play as soon as you have that much mana—for example, you will generally cast a <auto-card>Despise</auto-card> on turn one, but Eerie Interlude isn't usually a turn-three priority.)</p>

<p>A good "mana curve" of creatures is crucial to a successful Sealed Deck. You don't want to have a ton of cards at any single spot in the curve. It's important for you to be able to have a good mix so you can play your cheap spells in the early game and your expensive spells in the late game. As a very general rule for Limited, I would look to play something like this:</p>

<ul>
    <li>1 mana: 0–2 creatures</li>
    <li>2 mana: 4–6 creatures</li>z
    <li>3 mana: 3–5 creatures</li>
    <li>4 mana: 4 creatures</li>
    <li>5 mana: 3 creatures</li>
    <li>6-plus mana: 1–2 creatures</li>
</ul>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="" src="http://media.wizards.com/2015/images/daily/sealed-deck-curve.png" style="width: 750px; height: 343px;" /></p>

<p>That's far from hard and fast, but it's a good place to start. Cull your creatures down to these numbers by choosing your favorites.</p>

<p>Now that you have your core creature base figured out, it's time to add in spells! Pick your favorites among your colors to bring your deck to 22 or 23 cards, and then you're good to go from the spell side.</p>

<p>The spells you're going to want the most are what are called "removal spells"—these are the spells that permanently neutralize your opponent's creatures by either dealing damage, keeping them tapped, or just straight-up destroying them. Sealed Deck <em>Magic</em> is all about creatures, so you'll want to play most of the cards in your colors that can get rid of your opponent's creatures.</p>

<p>Interested in more tips? Here are a few more things to keep in mind for deck building:</p>

<ul>
    <li>You can play more than 40 cards, but you really should stick to 40 if you can. Every card you play past 40 just means it's that much less likely you're going to draw that awesome rare you put in your deck!</li>
    <li>The land ratio you're looking at should be about 17 lands to 23 nonlands. This isn't right 100% of the time, but most Limited decks end up looking like this, and, in general, it's what I would want to have.</li>
    <li>Play a mix of cheap-to-cast and expensive-to-cast cards. If you have all cheap, small creatures, then a single big creature can shut you down. Likewise, if you have all expensive, large creatures, you risk getting run over first. Stick to a mix that focuses on the two-, three-, four-, and five-casting-cost creatures. More games of Sealed Deck are won by casting a creature every turn starting on turn two or three than any other way.</li>
    <li>Evasion is important! Often, Sealed Deck games will get into stalls where both players have a lot of creatures and neither player can attack very well. Creatures with abilities like flying ensure that you can break through these creature stalls.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Two-Headed Giant</h1>

<p>Some stores also support a version of Sealed Deck called Two-Headed Giant (often abbreviated "2HG"), where two players team up against other pairs of players. Each pair gets two Prerelease boxes from which the players build their decks. Your local store's tournament organizer can tell you more. Contact them for details. (And you can read more about Two-Headed Giant <a href="http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/ways-play/introduction-two-headed-giant-2016-01-14" target="_blank">here</a>!)</p>

<h1>Open Dueling</h1>

<p>If the idea of spending a day playing a tournament is a little too much, or if you have less time and just want to experience the excitement of <em>Shadows over Innistrad</em> on your own time, you can get involved in Open Dueling.</p>

<p>In this side event, you get a ready-to-play 60-card Intro Pack and use it to do battle against others participating in Open Dueling, including players participating in the main tournament who are between rounds! This is a great way to dip your toe into the water if you aren't sure the Prerelease is something you want to do or if you can't commit five hours to a Prerelease event. You can just play games in Open Dueling at your own leisure. Plus, it's fun!</p>

<h1>Solving Mechanical Mysteries</h1>

<p>From creatures that have abilities on both sides of the card to instants that create Clue tokens, <em>Shadows over Innistrad</em> has a bunch of wild mechanics running around!

<h1>The End of the Trail</h1>

<p>So, what's going on with Innistrad? Well, that's for you to find out! And somehow, I think you'd best do it sooner rather than later, sleuth.</p>

<p>Before fading off into the Innistrad night, I will point out once more that all of the cards in the set can be seen over in the <a href="http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/card-image-gallery/shadowsoverinnistrad" target="_blank">Card Image Gallery</a>.

</div>

<p>The source of Innistrad's madness has been revealed, and it's none other than the Eldrazi mothership herself: Emrakul.</p>

<p>It's up to you to help the Gatewatch (and hordes of Zombies) take down this insanity. And the best way to get your hands on the new cards to check out what's going on? The <em>Eldritch Moon</em> Prerelease, of course!</p>

<p>What's a Prerelease, why is it one of the most awesome <em>Magic</em> events for every kind of player, and what should you be expecting? Read on!</p>

<h1>Embrace Prereleases</h1>

<p>No matter where in the world I am or what time of year it is, I always try and go check out a local Prerelease. Why? Prereleases are just some of the most fun you can have playing <em>Magic</em>!</p>

<p>I vividly remember strolling into my first Prerelease was when I was eleven; I instantly knew that was the place to be. Here we are, about fifteen years later, and I <em>still</em> get excited for each and every Prerelease!</p>

<p>Prereleases are great because the set is brand new, the footing is fairly equal as everybody plays with the set for the very first time, and you're all just relaxing and having fun exploring the new cards. It's just a lot of fun! Even players who have been playing since the beginning of the game look forward to each Prerelease.</p>

<p>If you're a Sealed Deck veteran, you may want to skip ahead to the next section, where I talk about some of the differences you can expect at your local store for <em>Eldritch Moon</em>. But if you're new to the wide world of Sealed Deck, or are maybe just looking for a few extra pointers, then read on!</p>

<p>All right. So let's go over perhaps the most important part: finding a place to play a Prerelease! After all, you can't very well play if you don't know where to go. How might you go about that?</p>

<p>Well, if you don't already have a local shop you frequent, be sure to check out the <a href="http://locator.wizards.com/" target="_blank">store locator</a> to find one near you! That store may even offer preregistration. Prereleases are some of the most popular events around, so be sure to check and see if the store preregisters. The best time to find out an event is full is decidedly <em>not</em> when you show up and learn you can't play, so be sure to look ahead.</p>

<p>So you've found your store. Excellent!</p>

<p>Now it's time to prepare. With the Eldrazi lurking around every corner, you will certainly want to be ready for whatever comes your way! While you will be building your deck for the event with cards you're given when you get there, there's plenty to do besides just that.</p>

<p>For example, you may still want to bring a Standard or Commander deck to play for fun between rounds, a trade binder, pen and paper to keep track of life, and even a water bottle. And while you may want to remain hungry for victory, beating people at <em>Magic</em> doesn't <em>actually</em> fill your stomach, so something small to snack on (like an apple or granola bar) could be a great idea as well. You can expect a Prerelease event to take about four to five hours, so you'll want to make sure you set aside enough time for the entire event.</p>

<p>Okay now, let's see. You've found a store and you've gathered everything you might need to prepare for the Eldrazi takeover. You've even read through the recent <a href="http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/columns/magic-story-archive" target="_blank"><em>Magic</em> Story</a>, so you're up to date on <em>Magic</em> lore. And, of course, you've taken a look at the <em>Eldritch Moon</em>&nbsp;<a href="http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/card-image-gallery/eldritch-moon-2016-06-28" target="_blank">Card Image Gallery</a>.</p>

<p>You're all set! Now it's time to actually go and open up some of those cards!</p>

<h1>Zombification Nation</h1>

<p>When you head into the Prerelease and sit down to play, you'll be handed a snazzy new deck box containing everything you need to build your deck. Check it out!</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="" src="http://media.wizards.com/2016/images/daily/6gmsspYJbd.png" /></p>

<p>Everything you will be playing with (except basic lands, which the store will provide) comes right in here, plus a few bonus perks.</p>

<p>For example, you'll find this lovely Spindown d20:</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="" src="http://media.wizards.com/2016/images/daily/PLMuZhoUY8.png" /></p>

<p>And that's not all: for <em>Eldritch Moon</em>, you'll also pick up this awesome double-sided premium foil Zombie token. These are pretty sweet. Check 'em out:</p>

<div class="rtecenter">
<div class="flipping-image">
<div class="image">
<div class="side front"><img alt="" src="http://media.wizards.com/2016/ouhtebrpjwxcnw5_EMN/en_M5L7aENcIo.png" title="" /></div>

<div class="side back"><img alt="" src="http://media.wizards.com/2016/ouhtebrpjwxcnw5_EMN/en_aDmF5OOG9d.png" title="" /></div>
</div>

<div class="control"><button>Turn Over</button></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Notably, these are foil tokens—some of the first foil tokens we've ever made! You're definitely going to want to collect one to use for all of the Zombie tokens that will be running around.</p>

<p>Zombies are a major theme of <em>Eldritch Moon</em>, and you may have noticed they are actually also major heroes this time around!</p>

<p>Normally, all Zombies want to do is eat your brains. (Though they're not unreasonable. I mean, no one's gonna eat your eyes.) But in this set they get to shine alongside the Gatewatch for once. So celebrate your Zombies! Dress up as a Zombie, wear your favorite Zombie-related shirt, or just lurch into the store—whatever you feel like doing to raise your bright Zombie flag.</p>

<p>Some stores may even be running special Zombie-themed side activities at their Prereleases, like costume contests or makeup stations. Ask your local store to find out more!</p>

<p>Now, there's still one major element I haven't covered yet, which may actually be the most crucial: deck building! So let's hop right into that.</p>

<h1>Prerelease Packs a Punch</h1>

<p>Most important out of everything inside your Prerelease pack are the six booster packs that will give you the cards you need to build your Sealed deck, plus your shiny bonus Prerelease card (which could be any rare or mythic rare in the set!).</p>

<p>First things first: crack open those booster packs! Then, you'll have a stack of cards.</p>

<p>So...what now?</p>

<p>It's time to build your deck, of course!</p>

<p>Sealed Deck is a little different from normal deck building. You get to build a deck using only the cards in front of you, plus as many basic lands as you'd like. Also, unlike a normal Constructed deck where the minimum deck size is 60, you only have to play 40 cards.</p>

<p>The first thing you're going to want to do is figure out a method to pick which colors you'll be playing. I recommend playing two colors.</p>

<p>Some things that may draw you into specific colors are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A really strong rare you're excited about</li>
	<li>Plenty of "removal" cards that can deal with your opponent's creatures</li>
	<li>A lot of playable cards in that color</li>
	<li>A good "mana curve" in that color, meaning lots of creatures of different costs</li>
</ul>

<p>Ideally, the colors you pick will have all four, but if two or three of those are true that's plenty good.</p>

<p>Whatever your method, you're going to need to narrow down what you're playing. If you get stuck at the Prerelease, feel free to ask the players around you for help. (You are allowed to do this at a Prerelease; everyone is there to make sure it's a fun event!) If you get stuck, one fun thing to try is to pick a supported Innistrad creature type that fits in a color pair, such as Spirits (blue-white), Zombies (blue-black), Vampires (black-red), Werewolves (red-green), or Humans (green-white), and then build around them!</p>

<p>But whatever your method, now you have your colors down. From there, how do you take everything you have and figure out which 22–23 cards you're going to want to put in your deck?</p>

<p>Here's one process that may help!</p>

<p>First, lay your creatures out in mana-cost order. This helps you see what creatures you're going to potentially have to cast at each part of the game. (Don't lay your noncreatures out at this point unless they're cards you are planning to play as soon as you have that much mana. For example, you will generally cast a Graf Harvest on turn one, but Shreds of Sanity isn't a turn-three play.)</p>

<p>A good "mana curve" of creatures is crucial to a successful Sealed Deck. You don't want to have a ton of cards at any single spot in the curve. It's important for you to be able to have a good mix so you can play your cheap spells in the early game and your expensive spells in the late game. As a very general rule for Limited, I would look to play something like this:</p>

<ul>
	<li>1 mana: 0–2 creatures</li>
	<li>2 mana: 4–6 creatures</li>
	<li>3 mana: 3–5 creatures</li>
	<li>4 mana: 4 creatures</li>
	<li>5 mana: 3 creatures</li>
	<li>6-plus mana: 1–2 creatures</li>
</ul>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="" src="http://media.wizards.com/2015/images/daily/sealed-deck-curve.png" /></p>

<p>That's far from hard and fast, but it's a good place to start. Cull your creatures down to these numbers by choosing your favorites.</p>

<p>Now that you have your core creature base figured out, it's time to add in spells! Pick your favorites among your colors to bring your deck to 22 or 23 cards, and then you're good to go from the spell side.</p>

<p>The spells you're going to want the most are what are called "removal spells." These are the spells that permanently neutralize your opponent's creatures, by either dealing damage, keeping them tapped, or just straight-up destroying them. Sealed Deck <em>Magic</em> is all about creatures, so you'll want to play most of the cards in your colors that can get rid of your opponent's creatures.</p>

<p>Interested in more tips? Here are a few more things to keep in mind for deck building:</p>

<ul>
	<li>You can play more than 40 cards, but you really should stick to 40 if possible. Every card you play past 40 just means it's that much less likely you're going to draw that awesome rare you put into your deck!</li>
	<li>The land ratio you're looking at should be about seventeen lands to 23 nonlands. This isn't right 100% of the time, but most Limited decks end up looking like this. In general, it's what I would want to have.</li>
	<li>Play a mix of cheap-to-cast and expensive-to-cast cards. If you have all cheap, small creatures, then a single big creature can shut you down. Likewise, if you have all expensive, large creatures, you risk getting run over first. Stick to a mix that focuses on the two-, three-, four-, and five-casting-cost creatures. More games of Sealed Deck are won by casting a creature every turn starting on turn two or three than any other way.</li>
	<li>Evasion is important! Often, Sealed Deck games will get into stalls where both players have a lot of creatures and neither player can attack very well. Creatures with abilities like flying ensure that you can break through these creature stalls.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Two-Headed Giant</h1>

<p>Some stores also support a version of Sealed Deck called Two-Headed Giant (often abbreviated "2HG"), where two players team up against other pairs of players. Each pair gets two Prerelease boxes from which the players build their decks.</p>

<p>How does it work?</p>

<p>Well, the simple version is this: you and your teammate work together to build two 40-card decks. Then, you play against another pair of players in a one-game match.</p>

<p>How does this kind of multiplayer work? It's simple: all of your creatures and lands are separate, but you each share the same 30-point life total and take your turns simultaneously—plus you can block for each other too! To do the best you can, you'll need to work together to overcome the opposition.</p>

<p>Another really fun part of Two-Headed Giant is discovering which cards work even better in 2HG! For example, take Thermo-Alchemist.</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="" src="http://media.wizards.com/2016/ouhtebrpjwxcnw5_EMN/en_NUSf3njl3P.png" /></p>

<p>This deals 1 damage to each opponent, meaning that one tap from this creature will deal 1 damage to each of your opponents for 2 total damage to their combined 30 life total! Bam!</p>

<h1>Open Dueling</h1>

<p>If the idea of spending a whole day playing a tournament doesn't fit into how you prefer to play <em>Magic</em>, or if you have less time and just want to experience the excitement of <em>Eldritch Moon</em> at your own pace, you can get involved in Open Dueling!</p>

<p>You get a ready-to-play 60-card Intro Pack and use it to do battle against others participating in Open Dueling, including players participating in the main tournament who are between rounds. This is a great way to dip your toe into the water if you aren't sure the Prerelease is something you want to do, or if you can't commit five hours to a Prerelease event. You can just play games in Open Dueling at your leisure. Plus, it's fun!</p>

<p>Ask your local store about Open Dueling at the Prerelease, and prepare to battle!</p>

<h1>Eldritch Mechanics</h1>

<p>From emerging creatures to escalating abilities, <em>Eldritch Moon</em> has a whole host of new abilities running around!

<p class="rtecenter"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="478" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NRHvARONqzk" width="850"></iframe></p>

<p>Kaladesh is a world like no other we've been to. It's a gorgeous plane where incredible craftsmanship is prized and wondrous artifacts are built and used. Artificers and Pilots in Vehicles casually cruise through the streets. Of all the planes in the Multiverse, it's got to be one of the best to take a vacation to right now.</p>

<p>So why not plan your vacation to Kaladesh today with a nice visit to your local Prerelease? It's the only way to get your hands on the cards before they even come out on shelves, letting you check out the set before anybody else!</p>

<p>So where exactly can you find a Prerelease, and what exactly should you be expecting at one? Read on!</p>

<h1>The Wondrous World of Prereleases</h1>

<p>Prereleases are my favorite <em>Magic</em> events of the year.</p>

<p>No matter where in the world I am or what time of year it is, I always try and go check out a local Prerelease. Why? Prereleases are just some of the most fun you can have playing <em>Magic</em>!</p>

<p>You get to sit down, pick up some brand-new cards, and figure out how you want to use them at the same time everybody else is. It's an even playing field in a casual environment, where everybody shares all of that bubbling energy and excitement around a new <em>Magic</em> set!</p>

<p>I visited my first Prerelease when I was just eleven and instantly fell in love with them. Fifteen years later, not much has changed!</p>

<p>Prereleases are great because the set is brand new, the footing is fairly equal as everybody plays with the set for the very first time, and you're all just relaxing and having fun exploring the new cards. It's a lot of fun! Even players who have been playing since the beginning of the game look forward to each Prerelease.</p>

<p>If you're a Sealed Deck veteran, you may want to skip ahead to the next section, where I talk about some of the differences you can expect at your local store for <em>Kaladesh</em>. But if you're new to the wide world of Sealed Deck, or are maybe just looking for a few extra pointers, then read on!</p>

<p>All right. So let's go over perhaps the most important part: finding a place to play a Prerelease! After all, you can't very well play if you don't know where to go. How might you go about that?</p>

<p>Well, if you don't already have a local shop you frequent, be sure to <a href="http://locator.wizards.com/" target="_blank">check out the store locator</a> to find one near you! That store may even offer preregistration. Prereleases are some of the most popular events we put on, so be sure to check and see if the store preregisters. The best time to find out an event is full is decidedly <em>not</em> when you show up and learn you can't play, so be sure to look ahead.</p>

<p>So you've found your store. Excellent!</p>

<p>Now it's time to prepare to visit Kaladesh. While you will be building your deck for the event with cards you're given when you get there, there's plenty to do besides just that.</p>

<p>You should pack some wondrous inventions of your own! For example, you may still want to bring a Standard deck to play for fun between rounds, a trade binder, pen and paper to keep track of life totals, and even a water bottle. A Prerelease event tends to take about 4 to 5 hours, so make sure to set aside enough time for the entire event. You may want to bring something like a granola bar or apple to snack on, too. (You may want to check with the local store as well—they might even sell some food there!)</p>

<p>Okay now, let's see. You have a store targeted to visit, and you've filled your pack with everything you'll need. You've even read through the <a href="http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/columns/magic-story-archive" target="_blank">most recent <em>Magic</em> Story</a>, so you're up to date on <em>Magic</em> lore. And, of course, you've taken a look at the <a href="http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/card-image-gallery/kaladesh" target="_blank">Card Image Gallery</a>.</p>

<p>You're all set! Now it's time to actually go and open up some of those cards!</p>

<h1>Inventor's Toolkit</h1>

<p>When you head into the Prerelease and sit down to play, you'll be handed a quite, well, <em>inventive </em>new deck box containing everything you need to build your deck. Check out this marvel of engineering!</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img src="http://media.wizards.com/2016/images/daily/TAlDtfIrNa.png" /></p>

<p>Our product designers here at Wizards have been working to come up with some really interesting twists on a normal deck box, and I love how the <em>Kaladesh</em> one turned out! It gets even better in person too.</p>

<p>Everything you will be playing with comes right in the box—plus a few bonus perks.</p>

<p>For example, you'll find this lovely spindown D20 you'll get to walk away with:</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img src="http://media.wizards.com/2016/images/daily/h2vlOQKoVY.png" /></p>

<p>Now, there's still one major element I haven't covered yet, which may actually be the most crucial: deck building! So prepare yourself, because it's time to...</p>

<h1>Invent Your Tomorrow</h1>

<p>Most important out of everything inside your Prerelease pack are the six booster packs that will give you the cards you need to build your Sealed deck, plus your shiny bonus Prerelease card. (Which could be any rare or mythic rare in the set!)</p>

<p>First things first: crack open those booster packs! Then you'll have a stack of cards.</p>

<p>So...what now?</p>

<p>It's time to build your deck, of course!</p>

<p>Sealed Deck is a little different from normal deck building. You get to build a deck only using the cards in front of you, plus as many basic lands as you'd like. Also, unlike a normal Constructed deck where the minimum deck size is 60, you only have to play 40 cards.</p>

<p>The first thing you're going to want to do is figure out a method to pick which colors you'll be playing. I recommend playing two colors.</p>

<p>Some things that may draw you into specific colors are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A really strong rare you're excited about</li>
	<li>Plenty of "removal" cards that can deal with your opponent's creatures</li>
	<li>A lot of playable cards in that color</li>
	<li>A good "mana curve" in that color—meaning lots of creatures of different costs</li>
</ul>

<p>Ideally, the colors you pick will have all four, but if two or three of those are true that's plenty good.</p>

<p>Whatever your method, you're going to need to narrow down what you're playing. If you get stuck at the Prerelease, feel free to ask the players around you for help. (You are allowed to do this at a Prerelease—everyone is there to make sure it's a fun event!)</p>

<p>But whatever your method, now you have your colors down. From there, how do you take everything you have and figure out which 22–23 cards you're going to want to put in your deck?</p>

<p>Here's one process that may help!</p>

<p>First, lay your creatures out in mana-cost order. This helps you see what creatures you're going to potentially have available to cast at each part of the game. (Don't lay your noncreatures out at this point unless they're cards you are planning to play as soon as you have that much mana—for example, you will generally cast a Metalspinner's Puzzleknot on turn two, whereas Harnessed Lightning isn't usually a turn-two play.)</p>

<p>A good "mana curve" of creatures is crucial to a successful Sealed deck. You don't want to have a ton of cards at any single spot in the curve. It's important for you to be able to have a good mix so you can play your cheap spells in the early game and your expensive spells in the late game. As a very general rule for Limited, I would look to play something like this:</p>

<ul>
	<li>1 mana: 0–2 creatures</li>
	<li>2 mana: 4–6 creatures</li>
	<li>3 mana: 3–5 creatures</li>
	<li>4 mana: 4 creatures</li>
	<li>5 mana: 3 creatures</li>
	<li>6+ mana: 1–2 creatures</li>
</ul>

<p class="rtecenter"><img src="http://media.wizards.com/2016/images/daily/sealed-curve.png" /></p>

<p>That's far from hard and fast, but it's a good place to start. Cull your creatures down to these numbers by choosing your favorites.</p>

<p>Now that you have your core creature base figured out, it's time to add in spells! Pick your favorites among your colors to bring your deck to 22 or 23 cards, and then you're good to go from the spell side.</p>

<p>The spells you're going to want the most are what are called "removal spells"—these are the spells that permanently neutralize your opponent's creatures, by either dealing damage, keeping them tapped, or just straight-up destroying them. Sealed Deck <em>Magic</em> is all about creatures, so you'll want to play most of the cards in your colors that can get rid of your opponent's creatures.</p>

<p><em>Kaladesh</em> is particularly interesting, in that it has a high number of artifacts compared to a typical <em>Magic</em> set. You're going to have more artifact options than normal. Unless these are also creatures, they should be counted among your noncreature spells, so narrow it down to the ones you really want to be playing with.</p>

<p>Additionally, <em>Kaladesh</em> introduces Vehicles! More on exactly how those work later (or you can just <a href="http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/kaladesh-mechanics-2016-09-02" target="_blank">click here</a>), but they're sort of like creatures. However, you do need (other) creatures to be able to crew them. If you play a couple Vehicles, you can treat them like creatures for your creature count, but be wary of playing too many lest you end up with a board full of Vehicles and nothing to drive them!</p>

<p>Interested in more tips? Here are a few more things to keep in mind for deck building:</p>

<ul>
	<li>You can play more than 40 cards, but you really should stick to 40 if you can. Every card you play past 40 just means it's that much less likely you're going to draw that awesome rare you put in your deck!</li>
	<li>The land ratio you're looking at should be about seventeen lands to 23 nonlands. This isn't right 100% of the time, but most Limited decks end up looking like this, and, in general, it's what I would want to have.</li>
	<li>Play a mix of cheap-to-cast and expensive-to-cast cards. If you have all cheap, small creatures, then a single big creature can shut you down. Likewise, if you have all expensive, large creatures, you risk getting run over first. Stick to a mix that focuses on the two-, three-, four-, and five-casting-cost creatures. More games of Sealed Deck are won by casting a creature every turn starting on turn two or three than any other way.</li>
	<li>Evasion is important! Often, Sealed Deck games will get into stalls where both players have a lot of creatures and neither player can attack very well. Creatures with abilities like flying ensure that you can break through these creature stalls.</li>

<h1>Two-Headed Giant</h1>

<p>Some stores also support a version of Sealed Deck called Two-Headed Giant (often abbreviated "2HG"), where two players team up against other pairs of players. Each pair gets two Prerelease boxes from which to build their decks.</p>

<p>How does it work?</p>

<p>Well, the simple version is this: You and your teammate work together to build two 40-card decks. Then, you play against another pair of players in a one-game match.</p>

<p>How does this kind of multiplayer work? It's simple: all of your creatures and lands are separate, but you each share the same 30-point life total, and take your turns simultaneously—plus you can block for each other too! To do the best you can, you'll need to work together to overcome the opposition.</p>

<p>Another really fun part of Two-Headed Giant is discovering which cards work even better in 2HG! For example, take Spireside Infiltrator.</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img src="http://media.wizards.com/2016/bVvMNuiu2i_KLD/en_eeJjTal7eu.png" /></p>

<p>This deals 1 damage to each opponent, meaning that when this creature becomes tapped—perhaps from crewing a Vehicle or attacking—it deals 1 damage to each of your opponents. That's 2 damage to their combined 30 life! Bam!</p>

<p>Curious to learn more about how 2HG works and some of the intricacies of play? Be sure to check out the page all about it by <a href="http://magic.wizards.com/en/gameinfo/gameplay/formats/twoheadedgiant" target="_blank">clicking here</a>.</p>

<h1>Open Dueling</h1>

<p>If the idea of spending a day playing a tournament doesn't fit into how you prefer to play <em>Magic</em>, or if you have less time and just want to experience the excitement of <em>Kaladesh</em> on your own schedule, you can get involved in Open Dueling!</p>

<p>You get a ready-to-play 60-card Planeswalker Deck and use it to do battle against others participating in Open Dueling, including players participating in the main tournament who are between rounds! This is a great way to dip your toe into the water if you aren't sure the Prerelease is something you want to do or if you can't commit 5 hours to a Prerelease event. You can just play games in Open Dueling at your own leisure. Plus, it's fun!</p>

<p>Ask your local store about Open Dueling at the Prerelease, and prepare to battle!</p>

<h1><em>Kaladesh</em> Mechanics</h1>

<p>Vehicles and energy and fabricate, oh my! <em>Kaladesh</em> has a whole host of new abilities running around!

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>And we're back. Welcome once again to present-day Tarkir. As it has always been, mighty Dragons rule the skies and the five clans that comprise most of Tarkir's populace. Thanks, Sarkhan!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Dragons of Tarkir</em> is the conclusion to the <em>Khans of Tarkir</em> (wait, who?) block, and it includes exciting abilities new and old. And the name of the set is no coincidence—there are more than twice as many Dragons in this set than in any other set.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Each of the five clans has an icon associated with it. We were introduced to these icons with the <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&amp;method=visual&amp;action=advanced&amp;set=%5B%22Fate+Reforged%22%5D&amp;subtype=+%5Bdragon%5D&amp;type=+%5Blegendary%5D" target="_blank">Dragon broods</a> of <a href="http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/mechanics-fate-reforged-2014-12-29" target="_blank"><em>Fate Reforged</em></a>. These icons appear in the text boxes of cards closely associated with one of the five clans and have no effect on gameplay.</p>

<h1>Bolster</h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bolster is the signature ability of the green-white Dromoka clan. It hasn't changed since its appearance in <em>Fate Reforged</em>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="" src="http://media.wizards.com/2015/dftyuvbd564776rvf/en_VJoNzbj1Th.png" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To bolster, first find the creature you control with the least toughness. If there's a tie, choose one of those creatures. Then put a number of +1/+1 counters on that creature equal to the bolster number. Bolster doesn't target any creature. You don't determine which creature is getting the counters until you're taking the bolster action.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>So suppose you control a 2/2 creature and a 1/1 creature and you cast Sandcrafter Mage. When Sandcrafter Mage enters the battlefield, its ability triggers. In response to that ability, your opponent destroys your 1/1 creature. When Sandcrafter Mage's triggered ability resolves, you control two 2/2 creatures. Since both of these creatures are tied for the least toughness, you choose one of them. It gets a +1/+1 counter, and you have a shiny new 3/3 creature.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div align="center" style="margin-bottom:15px;"><img class="noborder" src="http://media.wizards.com/images/magic/tcg/products/ktk/7uhasdf2usnhz/divider_sldjkfhkdf.jpg" /></div>

<h1>Rebound</h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rebound is the signature ability of the white-blue Ojutai clan. Rebound is making its return (you all saw this coming, right?) after originally appearing in the <em>Rise of the Eldrazi</em> set. How it works hasn't changed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="" src="http://media.wizards.com/2015/dftyuvbd564776rvf/en_IMfZM9PCgW.png" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rebound lets you cast an instant or sorcery spell a second time for free. If you cast a spell with rebound from your hand, you exile it instead of putting it into your graveyard. Then, at the beginning of your next upkeep, you can cast the spell again without paying its mana cost. After casting it from exile, it's put into your graveyard. If you manage to have several spells rebound during the same upkeep, you can cast those spells in any order.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you have any creatures from the last two sets with prowess, casting a spell with rebound will give you two bonuses, once for each time you cast the spell. (Prowess doesn't appear in <em>Dragons of Tarkir</em>.)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rebound works only if the spell resolves. If it's countered for any reason, either because your opponent casts a spell like Negate or because all of the spell's targets became illegal, it won't rebound. It will just be put into your graveyard with no effect. If you can't cast the spell from exile, perhaps because it requires a target and none are available at that time, then the spell just stays in exile.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p name="anchor3">&nbsp;</p>

<div align="center" style="margin-bottom:15px;"><img class="noborder" src="http://media.wizards.com/images/magic/tcg/products/ktk/7uhasdf2usnhz/divider_sldjkfhkdf.jpg" /></div>

<h1>Exploit</h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Exploit is the signature ability of the blue-black Silumgar clan. When a creature with exploit enters the battlefield, you may sacrifice a creature you control.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="" src="http://media.wizards.com/2015/dftyuvbd564776rvf/en_pP67KZDyXy.png" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>But you're not just sacrificing your loyal minions for fun. Each creature with exploit has another ability that gives you a benefit when it "exploits a creature." This means when you sacrifice a creature because of its exploit ability. That ability doesn't trigger if you sacrifice a creature for any other reason, including the exploit ability of a different creature.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can sacrifice any creature you control when the exploit ability resolves, including the creature with exploit itself. You don't have to sacrifice a creature if you don't want to. If you do, you choose which one as the exploit ability resolves. To get the most out of your minions, look for creatures with abilities that give you an added benefit when they die.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p name="anchor4">&nbsp;</p>

<div align="center" style="margin-bottom:15px;"><img class="noborder" src="http://media.wizards.com/images/magic/tcg/products/ktk/7uhasdf2usnhz/divider_sldjkfhkdf.jpg" /></div>

<h1>Dash</h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dash is the signature mechanic of the black-red Kolaghan clan. Dash allows your creatures to strike and disappear before your opponent knows what's happened. It hasn't changed since its appearance in <em>Fate Reforged</em>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="" src="http://media.wizards.com/2015/dftyuvbd564776rvf/en_e6E1MV7CbS.png" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dash is an alternative cost found on creature spells. As you cast a spell with dash, you can pay its dash cost instead of paying its mana cost. If you do, the creature will have haste, so it can attack that turn. At the beginning of the next end step, you'll return the creature from the battlefield to its owner's hand.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you choose to pay the dash cost, you're still casting the spell, so it goes on the stack and can be countered. Dash doesn't change when you can cast creature spells, usually only during your main phase. If you cast a creature spell using its dash cost, it will return to your hand only if it's still on the battlefield at the beginning of the next end step. If it leaves the battlefield before that point, it'll just stay wherever it is.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some dash costs are lower than the mana costs of the creature cards they're on. So, if you have four mana available you can cast Sprinting Warbrute a bit earlier than you otherwise could and get an extra attack in. On the next turn, you can cast it for its mana cost and it'll stay on the battlefield like normal. Other cards have dash costs that are the same or higher than their mana costs. Attacking with such a creature right away can be powerful, so you may want to cast such a creature using it dash cost even if you could pay its mana cost.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p name="anchor5">&nbsp;</p>

<div align="center" style="margin-bottom:15px;"><img class="noborder" src="http://media.wizards.com/images/magic/tcg/products/ktk/7uhasdf2usnhz/divider_sldjkfhkdf.jpg" /></div>

<h1>Formidable</h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Formidable is the signature mechanic of the red-green Atarka clan. Formidable is an ability word, so every formidable ability is different, but they all care in some way about controlling creatures with total power 8 or greater. Read each one carefully to see exactly what it does.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="" src="http://media.wizards.com/2015/dftyuvbd564776rvf/en_PY6QAUKUoR.png" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When calculating the total power of creatures you control, use their actual powers, even if they're less than 0. For example, say you control creatures that are 0/3, 4/4, and 8/8. The total power of creatures you control is 12. But if your opponent cast a spell that gave the 4/4 creature -6/-0, you'd have an 0/3, a -2/4 and an 8/8. Their total power is 6.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Stampeding Elk Herd's ability has an "intervening 'if'" clause, which is basically a condition of a triggered ability sandwiched in the middle. Abilities like this check the condition two times: once when the ability would trigger. If you don't control creatures with total power 8 or greater at that time, the ability doesn't even trigger. If the ability does trigger, it checks whether you still control creatures with power 8 or greater to see if it resolves. If you don't, the ability does nothing.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Other formidable abilities are activated abilities. You must control creatures with total power 8 or greater in order to activate them. However, once you activate such an ability, it doesn't matter what happens to your creatures. Even if their total power dips below 8, the activated ability will be unaffected.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p name="anchor6">&nbsp;</p>

<div align="center" style="margin-bottom:15px;"><img class="noborder" src="http://media.wizards.com/images/magic/tcg/products/ktk/7uhasdf2usnhz/divider_sldjkfhkdf.jpg" /></div>

<h1>Megamorph</h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Think of everything you loved about the morph ability from <em>Khans of Tarkir</em>. Megamorph is all of that, but bigger!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="" src="http://media.wizards.com/2015/dftyuvbd564776rvf/en_G14uHw2nVv.png" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you understand how morph works, megamorph is almost exactly the same. The only difference is that if you turn a face-down creature with megamorph face up by paying its megamorph cost, not only will it suddenly have its normal characteristics, but you'll put a +1/+1 counter on it as well! Note that if you turn a face-down creature face up some other way (for example, say you manifest a card with megamorph and turn it face up by paying its mana cost), it doesn’t get the counter.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Turning a creature face-up doesn't use the stack and it can't be responded to. So if I controlled a face-down Aerie Bowmasters and turned it face up, it would be a 4/5 (3/4 with the +1/+1 counter) before any player could do anything.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The morph overlay returns in <em>Dragons of Tarkir</em> booster packs to place on face-down creatures with megamorph. It's not necessary to distinguish between creatures you cast face down (although distinguishing between them and manifested cards is still required). This accessory is optional. You don’t have to use them, but look how cool they make your face-down creatures look! They're also a good way to remember to show your opponent what your face-down creature was if it leaves the battlefield or the game ends.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="" src="http://media.wizards.com/2015/dftyuvbd564776rvf/en_QTioWbxJij.png" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you weren't part of the reality that included morph (blame Sarkhan), you can read all about it in the "<a href="http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/mechanics-khans-tarkir" target="_blank">Mechanics of <em>Khans of Tarkir</em></a>" article.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>May you all serve your dragonlords well, at the Prerelease and beyond.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We started in <em>Khans of Tarkir</em> with a world without dragons. In <em>Fate Reforged</em>, we went back into the past and Sarkhan Vol revived Ugin, causing dragons to reappear on Tarkir.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>And now here we are. Once again on Tarkir. It's the same plane—and yet so very, very different.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Welcome to <em>Dragons of Tarkir</em>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div align="center"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="450" scrolling="no" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/e8UvZBfa0JM" width="650"></iframe></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It's time to align with one of five dragons on this new world. Will you fight for Dromoka, Ojutai, Silumgar, Kolaghan, or Atarka?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>And, of course, the best way to align is the Prerelease!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the Prerelease, you'll have a chance to make your allegiance known and to even become a dragon and burn down some hapless citizens of Tarkir! If that sounds awesome—or you just want some tips on deck building and playing at the Prerelease—read on!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Dragon Warriors</h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tarkir may be a deadly place—but the Prerelease is one of the best (and safest) ways to go and check it out! Prereleases have always been some of my favorite tournaments. The set is brand new, and the footing is fairly equal as everybody plays with the set for the first time.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>One of my first tournaments was actually a Prerelease in 2001, when I was just eleven years old—and I had so much fun there that I've always eagerly awaited them ever since! Even now, inside Wizards, fourteen years later, I still eagerly look forward to seeing how the Prerelease unfolds!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It's your first chance to play with the new cards before anybody else and get an edge over all your friends. It's even. And most of all, it's a low-key, more casual event that's just a lot of fun!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you're a Sealed Deck veteran, you may want to skip ahead to the next section, where I talk about some of the differences and special pieces you can expect at your local store for <em>Dragons of Tarkir</em>. (Like, for example, how you're going to rain fire down upon some of Tarkir's citizens!) But if you're new to this whole Sealed Deck shindig, or are maybe just looking for a few extra pointers, then read on!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="" src="http://media.wizards.com/2015/images/daily/cardart_H0njz9txi1.jpg" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Okay. So step one is you actually have to get to one of these "Prerelease" events in the first place. How might you go about that?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Well, if you don't already have a local shop you frequent, be sure to check out the <a href="http://locator.wizards.com/" target="_blank">store locator</a> to find one near you! That store may even offer preregistration. Prereleases are one of the most popular events we put on, so be sure to check and see if the store preregisters. The best time to find out an event is full is decidedly not when you show up and learn you can't play, so be sure to look ahead.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Okay. Great. You've found your store—excellent! Next step!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It's dangerous out there in Tarkir, and—whether you're a Planeswalker, a dragon, or merely a one-eyed homunculus wandering around—having the appropriate essentials packed for your travels is crucial! While you will be building your deck for the event with cards you're given when you get there, there's plenty to do beside just that.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For example, you may still want to bring a Standard or Commander deck to play between rounds for fun, a trade binder, pen and paper to keep track of life, and even a water bottle plus a few granola bars to snack on. You can expect a Prerelease event to take about four to five hours, so just like in the <em>Lion King</em>—and sing it with me now—<em>beeeeee preparrrreeeeeeeddd!</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Okay, now that the musical interlude is out of the way, let's see. You have a store and you've packed your trusty bag with all of the essentials to travel into the past. You've watched <em>How to Train Your Dragon</em> four times and have thought through what you're going to name each of the dragons you open.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>That means it's time for…</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Here Be Dragons</h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Whether you've been following along for the entirety of Tarkir block or <em>Dragons of Tarkir</em> is your first sojourn into the world, you're going to be starting at the same spot. It is a whole new world, after all!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you're used to thinking about three-color cards because of <em>Khans of Tarkir</em>, you'll want to rinse out your brain a little bit. <em>Dragons of Tarkir</em> is <em>a two-color set.</em> Yes, that's right. You'll be aligning yourself with one of five dragonlords, each of which is two colors. We first saw them in <em>Fate Reforged</em>, and they're still here more than a millennium later—and now they have dominance over their respective clans!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>What are these new clans? What can you expect if you play them? Well, let's take a walk through each of the five!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Dromoka</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="" src="http://media.wizards.com/2015/images/daily/ARC20150305_Dromoka_symbol.jpg" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dromoka likes to build up an army and then slay her enemies with it. As a member of the green-white Dromoka, you'll be able to play plenty of creatures—and then beef them up with the returning bolster mechanic from <em>Fate Reforged</em>. Ally yourself with Dromoka, and send your legions to roll over your enemies!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Ojutai</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="" src="http://media.wizards.com/2015/images/daily/ARC20150305_ojutai_symbol.jpg" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Followers of the white-blue Ojutai like to play a tempo game and use spells to their advantage. Many Ojutai spells have the mechanic rebound, which means you'll get the spell's effect twice! Whether a powerhouse sorcery or a simple instant to help your creature win in combat, you'll get double use out of your spells! If you like soaring through the air and using spells to cleverly beat past your opponent's creatures, Ojutai is the dragon for you!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Silumgar</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="" src="http://media.wizards.com/2015/images/daily/ARC20150305_silumgar_symbol.jpg" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Silumgar is ruthless—and those who follow him are just as crafty. The blue-black Silumgar cards are tricky and versatile, partially thanks to the brand-new exploit ability! Exploit creatures let you sacrifice creatures—themselves included!—for an additional effect. Have a creature with a "when this dies…" trigger or something small you don't need anymore? Sacrifice it for the greater glory of Silumgar! If you like versatility and aren't afraid to sacrifice some of your own creatures, give Silumgar your devotion!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Kolaghan</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="" src="http://media.wizards.com/2015/images/daily/ARC20150305_Kolaghan_symbol.jpg" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fast. Brutal. Efficient. Kolaghan's black-red army hits hard and seeks to end the game quickly. Kolaghan harnesses the same ability we saw in <em>Fate Reforged</em>: dash! Thanks to dash, your creatures can come down even faster, and with haste, to deal damage even quicker. If you want to be aggressive and quickly slay your enemies, Kolaghan will be right up your dragon-laden alley.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Atarka</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="" src="http://media.wizards.com/2015/images/daily/ARC20150305_alarka_symbol.jpg" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a world full of big dragons, the red-green Atarka wants you to have some of the overall beefiest board states. The new formidable mechanic means your creatures get better when you have at least 8 power on the battlefield. So whether you want to have a couple big creatures or a smaller army, Atarka is interested in your service. If you like smashing with big creatures and the thrill of trying to get 8 points of power onto the board, choose Atarka!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>All right! So you've chosen the two-color dragon you want to align with! Now it's time to kick everything off!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>You'll go to your store, choose your clan (or, if you preregistered, perhaps you already chose when you did that), be handed a clan box, and it's off to the races!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Inside this box you'll find a lot of neat things. But most key to your day are going to be the six booster packs that will give you the cards you need to build your Sealed Deck (four <em>Dragons of Tarkir</em>, one <em>Fate Reforged</em>, and one special booster full of cards to help you play your colors).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>First, rip those packs open! If you want to add some fun sound effects (sound effects make <em>everything </em>better), feel free to pretend to breathe fire on them. Then, you'll have a stack of cards.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>So…what now?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It's time to build your deck, of course!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sealed Deck is a little different from normal deck building. You get to build a deck only out of the cards in front of you, plus as many basic lands as you'd like. Also, unlike a normal Constructed deck where the minimum deck size is 60, you only have to play 40 cards.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Deck building in Sealed can be tricky—and this is where that special booster comes in!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When you picked your box you chose a dragonlord, and that dragonlord matches up with the contents of your special "seed booster" that was wrapped in plastic as you opened your box. This "seeded deck" experience helps you figure out what colors to play. That pack contains cards only in your chosen dragonlord's colors—meaning that's a pretty safe bet for easily making your deck as those two colors.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>While you are allowed to play any colors you want, most often it's going to be advantageous to play the colors of your dragonlord. So, what I would recommend is to just set aside all of the cards of the other colors and pick the best cards out of those two colors. If there's a really cool rare or strong card in another color you want to play, set it aside and come back to it later—since you could consider "splashing" it if you have the right mana-fixing—but in general you'll want to put away cards of other colors here.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>All right, so how do you narrow down all of your cards down to the 22–23 cards you're going to want to put in your deck? It's time to lay them out!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Take the cards of your clan's colors and lay out the creatures in mana-cost order. This helps you see what creatures you're going to potentially have to cast at each part of the game. (Don't lay your noncreatures out at this point unless they're cards you are planning to play as soon as you have that much mana—for example, you will generally cast a Soulfire Grand Master on turn two, but a Roast usually not. I would also generally count all instants and sorceries with manifest as creatures.)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A good "mana curve" of creatures is crucial to a successful Sealed Deck. You don't want to have a ton of cards at any single spot in the curve: it's important for you to be able to have a good mix so you can play your cheap spells in the early game and your expensive spells in the late game. As a very general rule for Limited, I would look to play something like this:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1 mana: 0–2 creatures</p>

<p>2 mana: 4–6 creatures</p>

<p>3 mana: 3–5 creatures</p>

<p>4 mana: 4 creatures</p>

<p>5 mana: 3 creatures</p>

<p>6+ mana: 1–2 creatures</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>That's far from hard and fast, but it's a good place to start. Cull your creatures down to these numbers by choosing your favorites. Keep in mind that any megamorphs you have can also be played for three mana, so often you'll be able to play fewer cards that cost three to help compensate for that curve!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now that you have your core creature base figured out, it's time to add in spells! Pick your favorites from among your colors to bring your deck to 22 or 23 cards, and then you're good to go from the spell side!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The last thing to figure out is your mana base! While two colors is what I would generally try to play in <em>Dragons of Tarkir</em>, sometimes you will end up in three thanks to some <em>Fate Reforged</em> mana fixing and some <em>Dragons of Tarkir</em> Monuments. So, especially if you're playing three colors, making sure you can cast your spells is important.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I would definitely play all of your nonbasic lands that produce mana of your colors. Even if they enter the battlefield tapped, it is a small price to pay for making sure you can play your cards on time. You'll want to play more lands producing mana of the colors of less-expensive cards in your deck than of the cards with the more expensive mana costs to ensure you can play your cheap cards on time.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Interested in more tips? Here are a few more things to keep in mind for deck building:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>You can play more than 40 cards, but you really should stick to 40 if you can. Every card over 40 you play just means it's that much less likely you're going to draw that awesome rare you put in your deck!</li>
	<li>The land ratio you're looking at should be about 17 lands to 23 nonlands. This isn't right 100% of the time, but most Limited decks end up looking like this and, in general, it's what I would want to have.</li>
	<li>Play a mix of cheap-to-cast and expensive-to-cast cards. If you have all cheap, small creatures, then a single big creature can shut you down, but if you have all expensive, large creatures you risk getting run over first. Stick to a mix that focuses on the two-, three-, four-, and five-casting cost creatures. More games of Sealed Deck are won by casting a creature every turn starting on turn two or three than any other way.</li>
	<li>Evasion is important! Often, Sealed Deck games will get into stalls where both players have a lot of creatures and neither player can attack very well. Creatures with abilities like flying ensure that you can break through these creature stalls.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Two-Headed Giant</h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some stores also support a version of Sealed Deck called Two-Headed Giant (often abbreviated "2HG"), where two players team up against other pairs of players. Each pair gets two Prerelease Packs (they don't have to be the same clans, even; you can figure out which two clans go well together—or double up on the same clan!) from which the players build their decks. Your tournament organizer can tell you more about 2HG if your store supports it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Open Dueling</h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If the idea of spending a day playing a tournament scares you, or you just want to experience more games with <em>Dragons of Tarkir</em>, you can get involved in Open Dueling.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In this side event, you get a ready-to-play 60-card Intro Pack and use it to do battle against others participating in Open Dueling, including players participating in the main tournament who are between rounds! This is a great way to dip your toe into the water if you aren't sure the Prerelease is something you want to do, or if you can't commit five hours to a Prerelease event, you can just play games in Open Dueling at your own leisure. Plus, it's fun!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Beyond the Cards</h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition to all of those cool regular cards in your packs (and hopefully some Dragons!) inside your box, you received a couple other cool things as well!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first is your Prerelease promo card. You can play with this in your deck—and there's a good chance you'll want to—so be sure to put it in your deck-building stack!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Also really cool and unique for this experience is a very special kind of Spindown™ life counter! No, seriously—check these out:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="" src="http://media.wizards.com/2015/images/daily/dicebox_jp9ADqRIy1.jpg" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Each one is themed to the breath weapon of that box's dragonlord. For example, Kolaghan's is lightning themed since she spits out lightning! These will be something definitely worth trying to collect, so don't accidentally leave yours at your table.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can also use them for something a little more than just collecting…</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can use them for raining fire down on Tarkir!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>What do I mean? Well, it's time to introduce you to something very special about this <em>Dragons of Tarkir</em> Prerelease and absolutely unlike anything we've ever done before. Prepare yourself for…</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Tarkir Dragonfury!</h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Every store will receive one of these wonderful boards, with pieces that stand upright on them:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="" src="http://media.wizards.com/2015/images/daily/TarkirDragonfurygame.jpg" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is Tarkir. And, aw, look at those orcs and humans and goblins hanging around. They're so nice looking and cute and harmless and…</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It's time to be a dragon and try and destroy as many as possible!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here's how it works. You'll get to go up to this board and assess it. Try and figure out the best angle of attack. And, then, you roll your special Spindown™ life counter you got in your Prerelease box (Remember how it's themed as a breath weapon? Well, here's your chance to use your breath weapon!) and try and knock down as many as pieces as possible.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Each piece has a point value on it. You get points equal to the total number you knocked down.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>But there's also a little bonus. See that circle in the top-middle? If your dice ends up in there, you'll double your score! If you can aim just right, you'll rack up a massive score.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Looks like it's time to break out the rulers and talk to your friends who are good at physics to figure out the best way to try and roll at this!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>But, of course, not all of us have that kind of patience. So you get <strong>two total rolls.</strong> Whichever one you get a higher score on, write down on the nearby score sheet! That's the leaderboard. Try and get the most points out of anybody in your store!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Oh, and did I mention there are special promo card prizes?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you knock down at least 3 points' worth of figures, you'll earn a promo! Here's what you can earn.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Knock down 3 points? Well, how about an Evolving Wilds!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="" src="http://media.wizards.com/2015/dftyuvbd564776rvf/en_J7tAa3MhEA.png" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finish off 9&nbsp;points' worth of foes? Have a Dragon Fodder, plus that Evolving Wilds!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="" src="http://media.wizards.com/2015/dftyuvbd564776rvf/en_J7tAa3MhEA.png" /> <img alt="" src="http://media.wizards.com/2015/dftyuvbd564776rvf/en_CoyyJqZ30g.png" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you can knock down 12 points worth, not only will you get that Dragon Fodder and Evolving Wilds, but you'll also snag an Dragonlord's Servant!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="" src="http://media.wizards.com/2015/dftyuvbd564776rvf/en_J7tAa3MhEA.png" /> <img alt="" src="http://media.wizards.com/2015/dftyuvbd564776rvf/en_CoyyJqZ30g.png" /> <img alt="" src="http://media.wizards.com/2015/dftyuvbd564776rvf/en_o665lnKMKS.png" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>And, if you're bad enough to score a whopping 18&nbsp;points, you'll earn all three of the other cards…and the rare Foe-Razer Regent.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="" src="http://media.wizards.com/2015/dftyuvbd564776rvf/en_J7tAa3MhEA.png" /> <img alt="" src="http://media.wizards.com/2015/dftyuvbd564776rvf/en_CoyyJqZ30g.png" /> <img alt="" src="http://media.wizards.com/2015/dftyuvbd564776rvf/en_o665lnKMKS.png" /> <img alt="" src="http://media.wizards.com/2015/dftyuvbd564776rvf/en_bHeaDo0uly.png" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>So, in short: you get to roll your Spindown™ breath weapon twice at any point between rounds, then score some nice promos based on how many points you get. Free stuff <em>and </em>getting to be a dragon? Count me in!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Magic</em> has really never done anything quite like this Tarkir Dragonfury activity, so get out there and check it out! Let's see just how powerful of a dragon you are.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>New Tarkir, New Mechanics</h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There's a lot happening in <em>Dragons of Tarkir</em>! I briefly talked about the five mechanics for each of the dragonlords, and that's not even beginning to touch on megamorph! You'll also be hopping into your TARDIS and doing a little bit of traveling back to <em>Fate Reforged</em> at this Prerelease, and there are plenty of other abilities present from that set as well.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Let's go over them one-by-one, courtesy of the "<a href="/node/346676">Mechanics of <em>Dragons of Tarkir</em></a>" article:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Bolster</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bolster hasn't changed since its appearance in <em>Fate Reforged</em>. To bolster, first find the creature you control with the least toughness. If there's a tie, choose one of those creatures. Then put a number of +1/+1 counters on that creature equal to the bolster number.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Rebound</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rebound is making its return after originally appearing in <em>Rise of the Eldrazi</em>. How it works hasn't changed. Rebound lets you cast an instant or sorcery spell a second time for free. If you cast a spell with rebound from your hand, you exile it instead of putting it into your graveyard. Then, at the beginning of your next upkeep, you can cast the spell again without paying its mana cost. After casting it from exile, it's put into your graveyard.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Exploit</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Exploit is a new ability. When a creature with exploit enters the battlefield, you may sacrifice a creature you control. Each creature with exploit has another ability that gives you a benefit when it "exploits a creature." This means when you sacrifice a creature because of its exploit ability. That ability doesn't trigger if you sacrifice a creature for any other reason, including the exploit ability of a different creature.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Dash</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dash hasn't changed since its appearance in <em>Fate Reforged</em>. Dash is an alternative cost found on creature spells. As you cast a spell with dash, you can pay its dash cost instead of paying its mana cost. If you do, the creature will have haste, so it can attack that turn. At the beginning of the next end step, you'll return the creature from the battlefield to its owner's hand.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Formidable</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Formidable is an ability word, so every formidable ability is different, but they all care in some way about controlling creatures with total power 8 or greater. When calculating the total power of creatures you control, use their actual powers, even if they're less than 0.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Megamorph</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you understand how morph works, megamorph is almost exactly the same. The only difference is that if you turn a face-down creature with megamorph face up, not only will it suddenly have its normal characteristics, but you'll put a +1/+1 counter on it as well!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition, these two mechanics from <em>Fate Reforged</em> might appear in your pack from that set:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Manifest</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When you manifest a card, you put it onto the battlefield face down. While face down, it's a 2/2 colorless creature with no name, no abilities, and no creature types. Face-down creatures are creatures in every way. Any time you have priority, you can turn a manifested creature face up if it's a creature card. You do this by revealing what its mana cost is and paying that cost. This also lets your opponents see that it's a creature card. As soon as the card is face up, it has its normal characteristics. If you manifest a noncreature card, it can't be turned face up this way. If you happen to manifest a card with morph, you can turn it face up either by paying its mana cost (if it's a creature card) or by paying its morph cost.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Hybrid Mana</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Several cards in the Fate Reforged set have abilities that include hybrid mana symbols. A hybrid mana symbol can be paid with either of two colors of mana. If a cost includes multiple hybrid mana symbols, you can choose a different color to pay for each.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Keep Calm and Dragon On</h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Dragons of Tarkir</em> is a whole new format compared to anything else in Tarkir block. With a suite of new mechanics, a host of Dragons, and a two-color focus, you'll be seeing the same plane—but with an exciting new world of possibilities.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I hope you all have a blast going out to a Prerelease, battling for your dragonlord and launching your breath weapons at citizens of Tarkir.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Oh, and if you'd like to go check out the many awesome cards you could open in the set, don't miss the full <a href="/node/348706" target="_blank">Card Image Gallery</a>—it has all of the cards in the set, in all of its dragony goodness.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you have any questions at all about the Prerelease or what you should expect, feel free to send a <a href="https://twitter.com/GavinVerhey/" target="_blank">tweet</a> my way or ask me a question on my <a href="http://gavinverhey.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Tumblr</a> and I'll be sure to take a look and help you out as much as I can!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Have fun this weekend. It's time to close out the world of Tarkir with a wonderful, fiery bang!</p>

You can find the official text of any card on <a href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/">Gatherer</a>.</p>

<h2>Zevlor, Elturel Exile</h2>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Zevlor, Elturel Exile" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/clb/en_itbK8LL8GN.png" /></p>

<p>Zevlor's activated ability was inadvertently printed without the word "only," which made the "single target" requirements read very oddly. This has been added in the Oracle card reference.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;"><strong>Old text</strong>:<br />
Haste<br />
{o2}, {oT}: When you next cast an instant or sorcery spell that targets a single opponent or a single permanent an opponent controls this turn, for each other opponent, choose that player or a permanent they control, copy that spell, and the copy targets the chosen player or permanent.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;"><strong>New text</strong>:<br />
Haste<br />
{o2}, {oT}: When you next cast an instant or sorcery spell that targets only a single opponent or a single permanent an opponent controls this turn, for each other opponent, choose that player or a permanent they control, copy that spell, and the copy targets the chosen player or permanent.</p>

<h2>Neera, Wild Mage</h2>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Neera, Wild Mage" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/clb/en_n2hEvvcoiJ.png" /></p>

<p>Neera, Wild Mage's printed text wasn't quite clear about what happens to the nonland card you revealed if you choose <em>not </em>to cast it. The text has received an update to clarify that it goes to the bottom of your library with the other cards.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;"><strong>Old text</strong>:<br />
Whenever you cast a spell, you may put it on the bottom of its owner's library. If you do, reveal cards from the top of your library until you reveal a nonland card. You may cast that card without paying its mana cost. Then put the rest on the bottom of your library in a random order. This ability triggers only once each turn.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;"><strong>New text</strong>:<br />
Whenever you cast a spell, you may put it on the bottom of its owner's library. If you do, reveal cards from the top of your library until you reveal a nonland card. You may cast that card without paying its mana cost. Then put all revealed cards not cast this way on the bottom of your library in a random order. This ability triggers only once each turn.</p>

<h2>Dynaheir, Invoker Adept</h2>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Dynaheir, Invoker Adept" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/clb/en_VP8txgcK4f.png" /></p>

<p>Dynaheir has an ability that, once activated, will copy the <em>next</em> ability you activate if you spent at least four mana to activate it. However, the card was printed without the words that are normally on this kind of ability that stop mana abilities from causing it to trigger. Without those words, activating a mana ability by spending four or more mana does cause it to trigger, but, contrary to what you might expect, that mana ability isn't copied when the triggered ability resolves.</p>

<p><em>"What?"</em></p>

<p>Yeah, it's weird. Mana abilities, by design, work very differently from other kinds of abilities. The biggest difference is that, to prevent them from being responded to, mana abilities don't use the stack; their effects happen immediately after they are activated. This difference comes with some odd implications for copy effects. A copy effect looks at the object in the game it is trying to copy, usually a permanent on the battlefield or a spell or ability on the stack, and uses that object as a template to determine what the copy should look like. In technical rules terms, we call this template an object's "copiable characteristics." Because a mana ability resolves immediately after being activated, it doesn't create an object that has these copiable characteristics. Without a template to build from, a copy effect trying to copy a mana ability won't do anything at all.</p>

<p>Are you still with me after that? It's admittedly a bit of a brain-twister. To sum up, we've added the missing words to Dynaheir's Oracle text so that the trigger condition will ignore mana abilities entirely.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;"><strong>Old text</strong>:<br />
Haste<br />
You may activate abilities of other creatures you control as though those creatures had haste.<br />
{T}: When you next activate an ability this turn by spending four or more mana to activate it, copy that ability. You may choose new targets for the copy.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;"><strong>New text</strong>:<br />

{T}: When you next activate an ability that isn't a mana ability this turn by spending four or more mana to activate it, copy that ability. You may choose new targets for the copy.</p>

To get to know what this set is all about, check out the <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/commander-legends-battle-baldurs-gate-product-overview-2022-05-17" target="_blank">product overview</a> and the article covering <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/collecting-commander-legends-battle-baldurs-gate-2022-05-17" target="_blank">what you can collect</a>.</p>

<p>We return to the familiar 300 cards on <em>The List </em>for <em>Commander Legends: Battle for Baldur's Gate</em>. The <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/whats-new-list-streets-new-capenna-2022-04-14" target="_blank"><em>Streets of New Capenna</em> release featured a twist on <em>The List</em></a>; there were fewer cards so we could make more room for the special in-<em>Magic </em>versions of the <em>Secret Lair x Stranger Things </em>cards to be included.</p>

<p>This time around, we jump back up to a full selection of 300 cards from across <em>Magic</em>'s history that can appear in the final card slot of Set Boosters 25% of the time. These cards fit well with the set's narrative and mechanical themes, and you'll find all rarities represented, from commons to mythic rares. Plus, in-<em>Magic</em> versions of the <em>Secret Lair x Stranger Things</em> cards (except Havengul Laboratory) are included as well!</p>

Step right up to the most unbelievable space carnival in the <em>un-</em>iverse! October 7 is the new April 1, our updated release planned for <em>Unfinity</em> at a <a href="https://locator.wizards.com/" target="_blank">local game store near you</a>. So, Mark (Rosewater) your calendar for October 7 when the fourth <em>Un-</em> set finally gets its day in the sun.</p>

<p>And because it's been a minute since we showed you what <em>Unfinity</em> has in store, you may want to revisit <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/unfinity-and-beyond-2021-11-29" target="_blank">the sneak peek we shared all the way back in November</a>.</p>

<p>There was an unfortunate issue with the <em>Commander Legends: Battle for Baldur's Gate</em> Prelease codes when redeeming them in <em>MTG Arena</em>. If this affected you, don't worry—your codes were not lost!</p>

<p>We implemented a fix last week that grants a voucher when you enter your Prerelease code. The voucher appears under the Packs tab. If you haven't yet redeemed a code, you may enter it to receive your voucher. Vouchers will be automatically converted to packs when <em>Alchemy Horizons: Baldur's Gate</em> is released on July 7.&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Update to Explorer Banned List</h1>

<p>As you may have already seen, there was a ban announcement yesterday for the tabletop Pioneer format. <em>MTG Arena</em>'s Explorer format is, as much as possible, a reflection of Pioneer, and as such we will also be updating the ban list for Explorer:</p>

<p>Effective June 9, <auto-card>Expressive Iteration</auto-card> is banned in Explorer.</p>

<p>In addition, the previously announced plan to unban and revisit <auto-card>Winota, Joiner of Forces</auto-card> in the fall is no longer in place. This card will remain banned in Explorer as long as it is banned in Pioneer.</p>

<p>For more information on the reasoning behind these actions, please <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/june-7-2022-banned-and-restricted-announcement-2022-06-07" target="_blank">refer to the Pioneer B&amp;R announcement article</a>.</p>

<p>When logging in on June 9 or later, you will receive an uncommon wildcard for each copy of Expressive Iteration you have in your collection. Please note: the usual pop-up for banned cards will not appear for these wildcards due to an ongoing technical issue; however, your wildcard inventory will still be updated correctly.</p>

<h1><a name="newcapennaalchemy"></a>Premier Draft New Capenna Alchemy Extended through June 13!</h1>

<p>We're extending the run for the Premier Draft New Capenna Alchemy event through June 13. This event offers an opportunity to get Alchemy cards by drafting. (The Premier Draft New Capenna event remains available to play, too.)</p>

<p>Players draft three packs of <em>Streets of New Capenna</em>, but one common card in each pack is replaced with a card from <em>Alchemy: New Capenna</em>. This card can be any rarity, so some packs will have multiple rares!</p>

<p>Each Draft pack contains one card from <em>Alchemy: New Capenna</em>:</p>

<ul>
    <li>55% of packs contain an uncommon card.</li>
    <li>38.57% of packs contain a rare card.</li>
    <li>6.43% of packs contain a mythic rare card.</li>
    <li>Each rare appears twice as often as each mythic rare.</li>
</ul>

<p>Premier Draft New Capenna Alchemy has the same entry and payouts as the familiar Premier Draft events and awards <em>Alchemy: New Capenna </em>packs.</p>

In case you missed the conversation, we've got you covered with a recap below:</p>

<p><strong>Athena (WotC Moderator)</strong>: Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are joined today by Wizards of the Coast Game Designer Corey Bowen. Welcome, and thank you for being here!</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Corey</strong>: Hello, everyone! o/</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Athena</strong>: Hi, Corey! To start us off before I begin sharing community questions, what do you do at Wizards?</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Corey</strong>: I'm a game designer for <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>. I work particularly in card design, which may have been obvious! I focus on Commander content but work on the occasional draft set. Before <em>Commander Legends: Battle for Baldur's Gate</em>, I was the lead set designer for a lot of the Commander preconstructed decks you've seen since C20 [<em>Commander (2020 Edition)</em>]. This is my first draft set, and it's a big one, so I'm excited to talk about it!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Athena</strong>: What did you consider when trying to make sure this set was "accurate" to D&amp;D?</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Corey</strong>: There's a lot to consider when being "accurate" to D&amp;D. I took a very literal approach at first. There are dungeons, there are dragons. "Backgrounds" as a mechanic also had a lot of influence from the D&amp;D 5e mechanic. The whole feeling of creating and customizing your character was a big goal to achieve the feel of D&amp;D in this set. We had Baldur's Gate subject matter experts do a lot of research to make sure we were depicting characters "accurately" as well. Of course, we also developed a lot of new content that isn't familiar to D&amp;D yet. There's a balance between "strictly accurate" and "new" content. Many characters match to their Baldur's Gate incarnations pretty well, but many of them in the games also had pretty malleable power suites, and we chose to emphasize certain aspects of them to make better <em>Magic</em> cards.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Athena</strong>: What aspects of D&amp;D were difficult to channel into a <em>Magic</em> set? Did any individual cards challenge or delight you in an unexpected way?</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Corey</strong>: Dragons were difficult. In <em>Magic</em>, they're classically large flying creatures. To support a Dragon creature theme in this set, we needed to make smaller Dragons, so we took advantage of dragonborn concepts, which worked pretty well. That said, while canonically they exist throughout the Forgotten Realms, there wasn't much Baldur's Gate content featuring dragonborn characters, so we created some! Developing the dungeon was also difficult for many game designer-y reasons and individual characters are always challenging when there are so many. Lots of companions from the games could've gone any way since they often don't have very specific power suites. Overall, though, I think translating classic D&amp;D elements to <em>Magic</em> went pretty smoothly, if not for the occasional sacrifice of flavor for functionality. It's always difficult to fully match a set of Dragons to the five colors, too. There's never a perfect answer.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Athena</strong>: Why did you land on Baldur's Gate?</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Corey</strong>: There are many D&amp;D settings that we could've pulled from. Baldur's Gate has a political element to the setting that fits well in a game of multiplayer <em>Magic</em>. There was also a wealth of characters from the games that players could fondly recall fighting alongside. Baldur's Gate 3 coming up ahead was another great point of synergy to try and combine waves of hype for Baldur's Gate in general!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Athena</strong>: What was your biggest inspiration for getting into card design for Commander?</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Corey</strong>: Playing Commander. I studied game design in school and taught all my friends <em>Magic</em>. I prefer social games over high-tension tournaments, so it was only natural for me.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Athena</strong>: What makes this set different from AFR [<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Adventures in the Forgotten Realms</em>]?</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Corey</strong>: While both sets are <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> themed, <em>Commander Legends: Battle for Baldur's Gate</em> is much more centered around the social Commander format. Commander Draft and Standard Draft are incredibly different. AFR did a lot of work figuring out exactly what D&amp;D elements could make a great <em>Magic</em> set, and CLB [<em>Commander Legends: Battle for Baldur's Gate</em>] got to really build on top of that to figure out how to combine it with a <em>Commander Legends</em> set. The draft archetypes aren't that similar, but the flavor of what colors you'll find certain D&amp;D classes are similar.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Athena</strong>: It seems like this set was less about <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> and more about <em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>, while more of the iconic D&amp;D characters were in AFR. This feels limiting in a way.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Corey</strong>: Just as much as Ravnica or Kamigawa are part of <em>Magic</em>, Baldur's Gate is part of D&amp;D, and that's the space we were able to explore this set. And besides, it's not just from <em>Baldur's</em><em> Gate 3</em>. There is plenty of content from <em>Baldur's</em><em> Gate 1</em>, <em>Baldur's</em><em> Gate 2</em>, the DLCs for those, and even the <em>Descent into Avernus</em> 5e campaign. Actually, there is even some stuff from completely unrelated D&amp;D places! Ravenloft characters exist! Modrons are here! The Chardalyn Dragon is something I thought was cool from a recent D&amp;D book that we included! And even besides that, I tried to also have a lot of world-agnostic D&amp;D flavor in the set that is present in all campaigns. Campfire and Split the Spoils are examples of cards that play in the spirit of every D&amp;D campaign, and not just ones centered in Baldur's Gate.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Athena</strong>: Did you play <em>Baldur's Gate</em> games or have D&amp;D sessions on company time to get a feeling for the setting? Did you read some lore books?</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Corey</strong>: I play a lot of D&amp;D. I played some of the <em>Baldur's Gate</em> games to get a feel of the core fun of the setting and games, but I didn't play them all the way through. The set took a lot of work, so I needed to spend my time designing 360 cards and not completing all the games, haha. After I got a good idea of what made them special, I worked with creative designers who were a lot more familiar with the material to figure out what we should prioritize from the games. I've read a lot of lore about the companions.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Athena</strong>: What Easter eggs are in the set for D&amp;D players? Are there previews in the set for <em>Baldur's</em><em> Gate 3</em> that fans don't see and designers do?</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Corey</strong>: We wouldn't want to ruin all the fun, but what we can say is that we want this set to resonate with <em>Magic</em> fans, D&amp;D fans, and <em>Baldur's Gate</em> fans alike. For D&amp;D fans particularly, you can look forward to playing as some of your favorite characters, such as Minsc &amp; Boo, Tasha, and Baba Lysaga, and wielding some of D&amp;D's most iconic spells, including [autocard]Lightning Bolt[/autocard] and [autocard]Fireball[/autocard]! We also think the Background mechanic is a fun nod to well-known D&amp;D elements. The rulebook card treatment almost feels like an Easter egg, too! Some of the reprints are nods to D&amp;D monsters. [autocard]Gate Colossus[/autocard] or [autocard]Geode Golem[/autocard] (I forget which) is a Shield guardian, for example. There's a cycle of adventurers in the set that also directly tie into classic D&amp;D dungeons.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Athena</strong>: What are the highlights for this set for a fan who has little/no interest in D&amp;D?</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Corey</strong>: This is still a Commander set at heart, and we expect <em>Magic</em> players will be excited to see the new commanders and inclusion of powerful and cool new cards such as Dragons and planeswalkers. We also think the Battlebond land reprints and other sweet reprints stand out as cards that non-D&amp;D fans can still enjoy. D&amp;D is also a pretty broad "fantasy" setting, so I hope there are cards here with a creative concept that isn't too alienated from your existing decks!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Athena</strong>: Every released product has cards that are relevant and desired by commander players, leaving commander to be probably the format with the highest amount of relevant cards being released each year. What made Wizards and the development team think that a new dedicated set full of new cards was a better choice than an all-reprints set or a set made of a majority of reprints?</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Corey</strong>: We view it as why not both? In CLB, we are releasing four Commander decks with reprints. We're acutely aware of reprinting cards, and there are more reprints each year than the year before. We know that fans want even more access to cards that see a lot of play in Commander, <em>and</em> we were excited to make CLB its own thing and celebrate it for what it is. The overall ecosystem of where we put what reprints across all the sets is outside the scope of my role. The reprints that are in the set I think work really well for the set's fun and flavor.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Athena</strong>: How did the decision to implement this set into <em>MTG </em><em>Arena</em> come about? Was it first approached from a power-level approach, or was the set made and then it was decided that the power level would be appropriate to add to Alchemy and Historic?</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Corey</strong>: Nothing to do with power level. CLB is an exciting set, and the partnership with D&amp;D is something a lot of players love. We wanted to make sure <em>MTG</em><em> Arena</em> players had the opportunity to play with some of the cool elements in this set, in formats that currently exist on <em>MTG Arena</em>. Stay tuned for more about how CLB was implemented in <em>MTG Arena</em> closer to the release! Also, shout out to the design team who oversaw translating all of CLB's themes and mechanics to <em>MTG </em><em>Arena</em>. It was not an easy task, and their set ended up really sweet and unique!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Athena</strong>: Here's a fun one we got from the community—why is Bronze Walrus a Walrus, as opposed to any other card concept?</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Corey</strong>: Because it's cute and fun! We were looking for more concepts to play with for artifact creatures. I like to play artificers from time to time, so I was suggesting some "artificer animal companion" concepts. We landed on walrus because we thought it was visually distinct from the other creatures and had a lot of charm.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Athena</strong>: Ok, back to seriousness. A lot of <em>Magic</em> players feel as though EDH [Elder Dragon Highlander] is primarily dominated by five-color value piles. Was this kept in mind when designing <em>Baldur's Gate</em>? What steps, if any, did you take to make sure more restrictive decks shine?</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Corey</strong>: I don't see any five-color commanders in this set. ;) Seriously, though, a lot of my philosophy in three-color versus two-color is evident in the set. In Draft, it's really strong to be three-color rather than two-color, so I balanced that out by having the three-color legends be a lot more niche and difficult to play, with focused themes (most of the time). The two-color commanders in the set have a lot more flexibility and open synergies. This idea of "the more colors you have, the more specific and niche you should be" is a philosophy I like to carry forward outside just this set as well. Every designer is different, but I would say this philosophy is somewhat consistent among our group. There's a future Office Hours regarding the Commander format at large <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/crash-course-commander-commander-legends-battle-baldurs-gate-2022-06-10" target="_blank">if you'd like to tune in to that</a>!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Athena</strong>: How did some of the top-down card cycles—for example, 1d20 on combat damage ancient Dragons, initiative on the dungeon adventurers, etc.—get developed? How much did the iterative process change them?</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Corey</strong>:

	<ul>
		<li>Ancient Dragons: I wanted something really splashy and epic at mythic that felt like an embodiment of D&amp;D. Huge dragons that rolled a d20 and keyed off of the exact number rolled was a great starting point. It took a few brainstorming sessions and iterations to find abilities that felt right for the numbers rolled, but I think we got to something that has a real sense of wonder.</li>
		<li>Dungeon adventurers: These were first most designed as "initiative taker rare creatures that gave you a bonus for completing a dungeon." I wanted them to be really cool with initiative, but also work with previous dungeon decks (like the [[autocard]Sefris of the Hidden Ways[/autocard]] Commander deck in AFR Commander!) The creative treatment of having them all be adventurers throughout classic dungeons was from the concepting team, and I really loved that direction to give them some visual unity and sweet callbacks. Their abilities had some iteration, but none of them were too much. The blue one was copying spells with some different condition for a while. I remember the black one having a lot of iteration trying to find something that could fit in the text box (while keeping the hit counters to work with Assassin commanders).</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Athena</strong>: Another funny one. Ever think of reprinting [autocard]Chub Toad[/autocard] in the next core set?</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Corey</strong>: I'll try my best, just for you. ;)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Athena</strong>: What are you most excited about with this set?</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Corey</strong>: I'm excited about a LOT of things. It's my first draft set! How could I not be excited?! The response so far has been super uplifting and positive, so I've been pretty happy overall. I'm really excited to see people's responses after drafting the set and playing/building with the cards. Personally, I'm a fan of the initiative, myriad, and the Background commanders. I'm looking forward to building some sort of dungeon deck with the Backgrounds.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Athena</strong>: Will new Bane design be featured in the <em>Baldur's Gate 3</em> game?</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Corey</strong>: That's a great question for the BG3 social team <a href="https://twitter.com/baldursgate3" target="_blank">@baldursgate3</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Athena</strong>: Does the team see the impact that being designed for Limited causes (color restrictions, the need to follow archetypes, ensuring that things run smoothly during Limited games, rarities, and other things) as a good thing for Commander as a Constructed format? Or would it be better for Commander as a format if the design team were free from worrying about Limited?</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Corey</strong>: The purpose of the set is first and foremost: Commander Draft. We set out to accomplish the clear goal of a draftable Commander format. The secondary goal was definitely Commander as a Constructed format. Restriction breeds creativity, and I think we came up with some cool designs for this set for both Limited and Constructed. There are a ton of cards in this set that I think will be great for Constructed play. Not just the plethora of new commanders, but many ground-level cards like Cut a Deal&nbsp;or some of the mana rocks have a lot of reach outside Limited. There are infinite cards we could design for Constructed, so I don't think the Limited nature of the set constrained the Constructed applicability too much at all!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Athena</strong>: What was your favorite Limited archetype in this format?</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Corey</strong>: I really enjoy drafting blue-black dungeon-based decks or red-white myriad-based decks in this format. I'm always very eager to chase the Gate train when I see Baldur's Gate or Nine-Fingers as well.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Athena</strong>: What combination of Background commanders and Backgrounds did you find yourself most excited to draft in playtesting?</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Corey</strong>: Dungeon Delver, Raised by Giants, and Inspiring Leader are my favorites. Also Agent of the Iron Throne for my artifact decks.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Athena</strong>: How similar was the design process to that of the original <em>Commander Legends</em>?</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Corey</strong>: It was similar and not similar. The structure of this set mirrors a lot of what the first set figured out. They set a lot of groundwork to figure out how we could structurally make a draft that felt and played like Commander. A <em>lot</em> of their development time was spent engineering the blueprints for the format. So CLB got to add on to that work and spend a lot more time connecting it to D&amp;D and trying to solve some problems that CMR [<em>Commander Legends</em>] has. So CLB has a <em>lot</em> of structural similarities to CMR, but not because the development was the same. Mostly because CLB design was more like a continuation of the work CMR did, as well as a continuation of work that AFR did.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Athena</strong>: Regarding Barroom Brawl. There is concern regarding the rulings of this card. Was this part of the design of the card?</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Corey</strong>: We're aware of the interaction and there will be a piece about it in the <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/commander-legends-battle-baldurs-gate-release-notes-2022-06-01" target="_blank">Release Notes article</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Athena</strong>: What would you tell someone listening in right now who's interested in trying out <em>Magic</em> but doesn't know where to begin?</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Corey</strong>: If you have friends who know how to play, picking up a Commander precon and having them help you through your first game could work well. If you don't know any other players, <a href="https://locator.wizards.com/" target="_blank">finding a local game store</a> and picking up some Starter Kits from them could help. They might have in-store events (maybe featuring CLB!) as well. <em>MTG</em><em> Arena</em> has a great tutorial to get you started with the rules. There are a bunch of big <em>Magic</em> events called CommandFests coming up as well, which is full of <em>Magic</em> players whom you can ask for help! Commander is a very social format, so don't be afraid to ask for help in your games!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Athena</strong>: Alrighty, everyone! Our time here is coming to an end. I would like to thank everyone who joined us and submitted questions. And a special <em>thank you</em> to Corey for taking the time to talk with us all!</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Corey</strong>: Goodbye, all o/</li>

<p>For our second Office Hours, we welcomed Wizards of the Coast Game Designer Gavin Verhey and Play Team Senior Operations Manager Scott Larabee to the <em><a href="https://discord.gg/wZEDMaJwMY" target="_blank">Magic: The Gathering </a></em><a href="https://discord.gg/wZEDMaJwMY" target="_blank">Discord channel</a> to answer your questions around the Commander format as well as the upcoming set in general. In case you missed the office hours and couldn't join us on Discord, check out the recap below:</p>

<p><strong>Athena (WotC Moderator)</strong>: Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are joined today by Wizards of the Coast Game Designer Gavin Verhey and Scott Larabee from the Commander Rules Committee—welcome, and thank you for being here!</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Scott Larabee</strong>: Hello! I am Scott Larabee. I am the play team senior operations manager in R&amp;D at Wizards of the Coast. I also have been on multiple design teams for Commander products. Outside of Wizards, I am also on the Commander Rules Committee with Sheldon Menery, Toby Elliott, and Gavin Duggan.</li>
	<li><strong>Gavin Verhey</strong>: Hi, everybody!! So excited to be talking Commander with you all today! Lots of love was put into these decks, can't wait for you to try them. I'm Gavin Verhey. I'm just some dude who makes <em>Magic </em>cards. It's fun, and somehow it's my job <nbsp>. . . </nbsp>okay, okay. I also was the lead designer for the <em>Commander Legends: Battle for Baldur's </em>Commander decks and on the main set team. And maybe you watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvE8Mza7uRuiYlwiSDyJi9A" target="_blank">my YouTube channel, Good Morning <em>Magic</em></a>. Or follow me in one of six places on the internet. But really, just a guy who loves <em>Magic </em>and gets to make cards.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Athena</strong>: Alright. To start us off Scott, can you tell us a little about the history of Commander as a format?</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Scott</strong>: Commander was developed as a format in Anchorage, Alaska, in 2003. Sheldon Menery was stationed in Anchorage at the time, serving in the US Air Force. At that time, only the five Elder Dragons were allowed as "generals" and were shuffled into the deck. Sheldon was redeployed to Virginia in 2004 and taught the format to a few folks locally. He also introduced it to judges on the Pro Tour. The Rules Committee was formed during this time.</li>
</ul>

<p>Over time, the Rules Committee formed the rules as they are currently played today. Fun facts about early Commander rules:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<ul>
		<li>At one time, the starting life total for each player was 200 divided by the number of players</li>
		<li>All Commanders (then called "generals") had "protection from [autocard]Karakas[/autocard]"</li>
		<li>Singleton originally applied to basic lands</li>
		<li>No other players in a game could have your Commander in their deck. (Edited)</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Athena</strong>: Thank you! This one is for you, Gavin. Can you tell us about the <em>Commander Legends: Battle for Baldur's Gate</em> Commander decks and how they came to be?</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Gavin</strong>: Yeah, for sure! When we decided we were doing a second <em>Commander Legends</em> set, we thought attaching decks to it would make sense to help expand the set a little further. It let us show off the set in ways we couldn't in the main set—for example, I was thrilled to use "party" as one of the themes because it didn't really work as a main set theme, but <em>really</em> made sense in the world of D&amp;D. The first time around, in <em>Commander Legends</em>, we did two decks<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> but we really wanted a full gameplay experience of four decks here. So, we bumped it up to four decks. And from there, it was just a matter of finding all the themes<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> but that's for another question.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Athena</strong>: What is the Commander Rules Committee's role for this set?</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Scott</strong>: For all sets, the Rules Committee gets a chance to review the cards and comment. Early on in the development of this particular set, we were consulted about back stories as a way to make drafting more interesting. Also, Gavin Verhey brought the decks down to Sheldon's house while Toby Elliott and I were there on vacation, so we had a chance to play and comment directly.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Athena</strong>: Speaking of drafting, Gavin, can you share what Commander Draft is and how it came to be?</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Gavin</strong>: Sure! So I had the idea to merge two of my favorite formats: Draft and Commander. The idea was easy<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> but how would we make it work? We tried so many different versions of it! We ended up with two picks per pack to make the draft go faster, and so you could take cards that combo well together. For deck-building rules, we lowered it to 60 cards to make it more draftable and allowed duplicates because Draft lets you play any number of copies of a card (if you draft ten of a card in <em>Streets of New Capenna</em>, for example, you can play them all!). But our goal was that once the game started, it was just played like normal Commander—which is how it ended up!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Athena</strong>: With the precons, there's now a mythic Background for every color except green. Is there any plan to finish this pseudo-cycle in the future, or is Background unlikely to return in a future set?</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Gavin</strong>: Ah, yes, the missing green Background. There were four decks, and we were doing one new Background per deck which meant that one color would be left out. Having, say, a green Background with just a green "Choose a Background" legend in the red-green deck for example would be confusing. And it's not like green is lacking for tools in Commander. That said, if we did some one-of Backgrounds again, I'd definitely expect us to finish it with a green one.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Athena</strong>: Is this set designed to be drafted 1v1 or as a four-player Commander game?</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Gavin</strong>: You draft and then play multiplayer! My favorite way to play is draft at an eight-person table and split into two four-person games, but you can even draft it with four people. Great for keeping things small with friends right now!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Athena</strong>: Was removing the color-identity requirements for Draft ever a consideration when making the set?</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Gavin</strong>: We did investigate it! We tried a lot of things. But there were already some compelling reasons not to<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> and then we talked with the Rules Committee. And maybe I should let Scott tell the rest of the story.</li>
	<li><strong>Scott</strong>: When the CRC was consulted about drafting for this set, we indicated that we felt messing with color identity was not something we wanted to see. However, as Gavin mentioned earlier, Singleton and 100-card decks were rules modifications we felt would be ok for drafting.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Athena</strong>: Do you think cross-pod matches work with Commander Draft?</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Gavin</strong>: Yes! Absolutely. Something I even did with <em>Commander Legends</em> was save my decks to play against other people's later. Especially given it's multiplayer <em>Magic</em>, there's a lot of room for self-balancing in the game. You can always just attack the person with the best deck, after all! It's not like they're going to infinite combo you in Draft. (<nbsp>. . . </nbsp>Or at least if they did, I'd be <em>very</em> impressed.)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Athena</strong>: Thank you for all this fantastic insight into Commander Draft! Circling back to the Commander deck design, Gavin, can you share how the Commander face cards came to be? Were the existing D&amp;D character legends designed top-down to fit that character, or were they created as bottom-up designs for the set and then assigned a character?</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Gavin</strong>: Yeah, totally. It was sort of a little of both. We first figured out what the decks wanted to do—for example, that the party deck wanted a cheap commander who was good at assembling a party, and what creature type it would be. Then, we looked to the Baldur's Gate lore to see who might fit well. After selecting the character, we helped massage the rest of the design to feel more like the character—for example, Captain N'Ghathrod gained the ability to steal artifacts from graveyards because, I mean, it <em>is</em> a pirate!! So, it was a little back and forth between the creative and the mechanics. I am horribly biased of course, but I tend to think they ended up pretty fun and feeling like the characters, too.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Athena</strong>: How do you playtest for Commander in general? With other Constructed formats, you can add four copies and you'll likely see them at least every few games at worst, but that's not quite as easy with Commander's one-of limit and 100-card decks. You might play a dozen games and never see a card in a Commander game. Do you play with smaller, more focused Commander-style decks so you can play the cards more often? Or is there another strategy that you can talk about with how you playtest cards for Commander?</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Gavin</strong>: Yeah, really great observation. It is definitely a bit different than normal Constructed formats. The good news is that your commander is going to see a <em>lot</em> of play since you'll have it every game. The others<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> not so much. We do a lot of cheating cards into people's hands or shuffling all the new cards into the top half of people's libraries. If there's a card we specifically want to try, we might just put it in an opening hand. We also have some other quirky rules—for example, I have people cycle Sol Ring if they draw it in the first four turns. I already know that Sol Ring is powerful and will shoot you far ahead; I don't need to learn that for the 200th time.</li>
	<li><strong>Scott</strong>: When playtesting Commander, sometimes I'll make a less optimal play in order to get a new card into play for testing<strong>.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Athena</strong>: How were the themes decided for the Commander decks?</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Gavin</strong>: By doing a lot of hard work. ;) Okay, but really, we looked at things that made sense to do here and/or tied into the main set. It was a <em>very</em> long process, but to drill down the reasoning into just a sentence<nbsp> . . .</nbsp>

	<ul>
		<li>White-Black Party – Party makes <em>so</em> much sense for D&amp;D but is hard to make work in the main set. By doing it in a precon, it could let us blow it out with D&amp;D theming.</li>
		<li>Red-Green Cast from Exile – This ties into Adventures into the main set and seemed like a pretty unique red-green theme to do.</li>
		<li>Blue-Black Horrors – Mindflayers are awesome<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> and they also play a big role in <em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>! Seemed like a perfect tie-in to do it here.</li>
		<li>Blue-Red Politics + Dragons – I always like doing one slightly quirkier theme, and Noah Millrod on our team had the idea of doing a Commander deck that cared about things that had to attack—both yours and your opponents. It morphed into this. Plus, Dragons!</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>That's it in a very quick nutshell—but there's plenty more to it of course. Check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvE8Mza7uRuiYlwiSDyJi9A" target="_blank">Good Morning <em>Magic</em></a> for an upcoming video detailing it! Smash that like and subscribe button and<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> uh<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> stuff. Shameless plug. I guess I failed at making each of those just a single sentence. Ah, well. Sorry, English professors.</p>

<p><strong>Athena</strong>: Looking more broadly at Commander as a format, how do you feel about "must include" cards?</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Scott</strong>: I don't think there is any such thing as a "must include." I often leave "obvious" choices out of my decks. I enjoy playing decks that do something a bit off-center and not building my decks 100% optimally plays into that. People should play the decks they want to play. Have fun! Try different things! Embrace the chaos!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Athena</strong>: Is there a power level cutoff for commander cards? Is there ever a point where you look at a card and decide that it's too broken and needs to be scaled back? If so, were there any instances of this happening in the set?</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Gavin</strong>: Oh yeah, all the time. We think a <em>lot</em> about Commander power level and are constantly reining in our cards. For every time a card makes it through that makes people's eyes bulge at how ridiculous it is, there are probably a thousand that never saw the light of day. For example, one card we weakened a lot was Baeloth Barrityl, Entertainer. We found that mass goad of all creatures had fans but was frustrating if it was too powerful. We weakened it to be five mana and only impact 1-power creatures at base. After testing, it was very killable and dealt with but still let the people who really loved it play with it. And yes, you can Raised by Giants it—but the fact it's five, seven, and nine mana to recast is a pretty big price.</li>
</ul>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Baeloth Barrityl" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/clb/en_9OgCnBjOnM.png" /></p>

<p><strong>Athena</strong>: I've heard opinions that there are too many overly "designed for Commander" cards seeing play in today's environment. How would you address this as a perceived issue and is it possible we could see much more subtle design for Commander in the future?</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Gavin</strong>: Yeah, definitely taken a lot of this feedback under consideration. And I think you've really been starting to see it recently. We want to make more niche cards and legends that inspire you to go build different kinds of decks. We want to <em>really</em> avoid outmoding current popular (or even semi-popular) commanders and focus on new things. I feel like this set has done a pretty good job of that and getting our power level in about the right spot. We're trying to not make format hyper-staples either—[autocard]Arcane Signet[/autocard] was a mistake. (I made a whole video about that!) The one place where we have been a little more aggressive is on the strong white cards recently. Because, well, we listen to feedback, and y'all have certainly been asking. We're not aiming for "staple in every white deck," but "strong consideration for any white deck" is a reasonable target.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Athena</strong>: Scott, what game space do you hope to see designers delve more into when creating legendary creatures?</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Scott</strong>: I think the designers have been doing a great job. The CRC has always said that we prefer commanders that are not power engines all on their own (produce both the resource <em>and</em> the payoff), and we have seen quite a bit less of this style of Commander. Going forward, I'd like to see more Commanders that allow a new take on a known archetype (different colors, etc.).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Athena</strong>: Gavin, back to <em>Commander Legends: Battle for Baldur's Gate</em> how was it decided that Dragons should be a Temur-focused archetype this set?</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Gavin</strong>: Well, it <em>is</em> called Dungeons and <em>Dragons</em>. That's half the name!!! There are a lot of reasons why, but one thing that's unique about D&amp;D is it has dragonborn—small, nonflying dragons. So, we could actually do Dragon-themed archetypes with creatures up and down the curve, not all of which fly. That's a pretty unique and special thing about this product.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Athena</strong>: Finally, to wrap us up<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> as we all know, the last cut for a Commander deck is always the hardest. What was the last card that you cut from your most recent deck?</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Scott</strong>: The 101st card from my Blue-White Ranar deck was [autocard]Millicent, Restless Revenant[/autocard]. I was never happy when I drew it, so I replaced it. This is often how I make changes to decks.</li>
	<li><strong>Gavin</strong>: Oh, that's easy. I was changing my deck last night for a playtest today. I was really heartbroken about it, but I had to cut [censored <em>Dominaria United</em> card].</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Athena</strong>: Alrighty, everyone! Our time here is coming to an end. I would like to thank everyone who joined us and submitted questions. And a special <em>thank you</em> to Scott and Gavin for taking the time to talk with us all!</p>

<ul>

<p>You'll be able to find much-beloved cards in <em>Double Masters 2022</em>, with many featuring new art and some of your favorite cards from the past returning in new, fancy versions.</p>

<h1>Borderless Cards</h1>

<p>There are 80 borderless cards in <em>Double Masters 2022</em>: 9 commons, 21 uncommons, 30 rares, and 20 mythic rares. You can find these cards in both Draft and Collector Boosters, in foil and non-foil. They have alternate art in the borderless frame.</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Borderless Liliana, the Last Hope" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/2x2/en_2klLqAdlfw.png" /><img alt="Borderless Kozilek, Butcher of Truth" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/2x2/en_WVHfq8druY.png" /></p>

<p>In Draft Boosters, commons and uncommons that have a borderless treatment will be borderless a third of the time. That is, a third of all the non-foil Mulldrifters and Rampant Growths you'll open in <em>Double Masters 2022</em> Draft Boosters will have the borderless treatment. It's the same with the foils—a third of all the traditional foil Mulldrifters and Rampant Growths you'll open in <em>Double Masters 2022</em> Draft Boosters will have the borderless treatment.</p>

<p>Eleven percent of <em>Double Masters 2022</em> Draft Boosters contain at least one non-foil borderless rare or mythic rare. It's possible to open two borderless rares or mythic rares, including two mythic rares, in one booster.</p>

<p>Each of the two foil slots in <em>Double Masters 2022</em> Draft Boosters has a 1.25% chance of being a traditional foil borderless rare or mythic rare. It's possible to open two borderless rares or mythic rares, including two mythic rares, in one booster.</p>

<p>Each <em>Double Masters 2022</em> Collector Booster contains two rare or mythic rare borderless cards—one is non-foil, and one is a traditional foil or a textured foil.</p>

<h1>Textured Foil Cards</h1>

<p>Five borderless mythic rares have a special textured foil version. These cards are borderless with the same art as their non-foil and traditional foil counterparts but are foiled with a special textured pattern, giving the art some appearance of movement:</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Textured foil Kozilek, Butcher of Truth" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/tf_kozilek_2x2_3NYwesednW.jpg" /></p>

<p>These textured foils are exclusive to <em>Double Masters 2022</em> Collector Boosters. Three percent of Collector Boosters contain a textured foil mythic rare. The textured foiling is quite distinctive, but the textured foils also have higher collector numbers than the non–textured foil versions to help tell them apart.</p>

<h1>Foil-Etched Cards</h1>

<p>Each of the rares and mythic rares in <em>Double Masters 2022</em> has a foil-etched version. These foil-etched cards use the same art as their main set counterparts.</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Foil-etched Liliana, the Last Hope" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/2x2/en_eQ0T9QOjjd.png" style="width: 265px; height: 370px;" /></p>

<p>They are foil etched in what is now <em>Magic</em>'s standard approach to foil etching, using a matte frame with a special varnish in the same style as the foil-etched cards in <em>Commander Legends: Battle for Baldur's Gate</em>. Each <em>Double Masters 2022</em> Collector Booster contains exactly one foil-etched rare or mythic rare.</p>

<h1>Cryptic Spires</h1>

<p>Cryptic Spires is the first new-to-<em>Magic</em> card to appear in a <em>Masters</em> set—it's to help smooth out the mana in the Draft format.</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Cryptic Spires" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/2x2/en_RNFFTh1jHT.png" /></p>

<p>Each <em>Double Masters 2022</em> Draft Booster contains exactly one Cryptic Spires. Cryptic Spires is like a checklist card; it doesn't appear in foil, nor does it appear in Collector Boosters. Cryptic Spires is legal in any Commander deck. You can change the colors Cryptic Spires taps for between games at your Preview Event.</p>

This week, I'm going to tell you the story of the set's design and show off two preview cards.</p>

<p>Before I start with the story of this set, I want to remind you of how the original <em>Double Masters</em> worked, as this year's <em>Double Masters</em> follows in the footsteps of that product with a few small tweaks.</p>

<p>The first <em>Double Masters</em> had 332 cards (91 commons, 80 uncommons, 121 rares, and 40 mythic rares). <em>Double Masters 2022</em> also has 332 cards, but there's a slight tweak (91 commons, 80 uncommons, 120 rares, 40 mythic rares, and 1 card that shows up in every booster), it has one less rare and one new card that's a rarity below common. That card is called Cryptic Spires, and it's a brand-new card meant to help with mana fixing. (More on why the set needs it below.)</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Cryptic Spires" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/2x2/en_RNFFTh1jHT.png" /></p>

<p>Original <em>Double Masters</em> came in a fifteen-card booster and every booster had two rares/mythic rares and two premium (i.e., traditional foil) cards. All of that is true for <em>Double Masters 2022</em>, except it comes with the sixteenth card always being Cryptic Spires. (Note that this is just for the Draft Boosters; the Collector Boosters only have fifteen cards, although they will have four rares/mythic rares.)</p>

<p>When you draft the product, you get to take two cards for the first pick of each booster. This allows you to take both rares, two cards that combo, two cards that are high in synergy, or just two cards you like. Every following pick out of the booster is just one card. This means you draft two cards together three times during the draft. How drafting works hasn't changed for <em>Double Masters 2022</em>. (For more on the design of the original <em>Double Masters</em>, you can read <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/double-deal-2020-07-20" target="_blank">my article Double Deal</a>.)</p>

<p><em>Double Masters 2022</em> isn't trying to reinvent the wheel. Original <em>Double Masters</em> was popular, so the new set follows the same basic formula while creating something new thematically. The big question for Bryan Hawley and his Vision Design team (Erik Lauer, Yoni Skolnik, and himself) and his Set Design team (Michelle Roberson, Rob Shuster, Reggie Valk, and himself) was to find a new theme to build around, what we call a "topline" in design. Original <em>Double Masters</em> had an artifact theme. What would make a cool theme for <em>Double Masters 2022</em>?</p>

<p>The key to finding the theme was having a good understanding of what <em>Double Masters</em> sets are about (from the context of Limited; from a Constructed standpoint, we want them to deliver a lot of cards players will get excited to open).</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>They cater to highly enfranchised players.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>In most sets, we spend a lot of time making sure less enfranchised players will find the set's themes and draft structure approachable. <em>Double Masters</em> doesn't have this issue as the key audience for it are people who are well versed in the game. This allows it to do many things that normal sets can't, which I will touch upon in the points below.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>The average power level is higher.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Being a reprint set (meaning the cards, especially at higher rarities, are skewed toward things players want for Constructed purposes), the cards tend to be from the powerful end of the spectrum. Adding that the set has more rares and mythic rares than normal showing up at twice the rate per pack, and you end up with a Limited environment that's a bit more juiced than average.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>The complexity is higher.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Enfranchised players can handle more going on in the Limited environment, so that allows the designers to ratchet up both how many themes there are in the set and how much variety exists (such as how many different named mechanics are used) within those themes. It also allows a lot more nuance and synergy to be built in.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>The synergy is higher.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The higher power level and higher complexity allow the designers more ability to weave advanced themes through the set that can interact with one another.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Rares/mythic rares have a larger impact in Limited.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Having a doubled as-fan allows rares to function closer to how uncommons function in a normal draft. There's a greater ability to rely on seeing them and more opportunity to build around them. This is only strengthened by each pack starting with two picks.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Everything is "up a notch."</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>All of the above allows the designers to make choices with <em>Double Masters</em> Limited environments that would be off limits to most other sets. As we'll see in a second, it opens up opportunities to do things that just can't fit within the confines of a normal set.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>There's high excitement.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, desired reprints come with a lot of built-in excitement, and that excitement carries over to the Limited format. It's fun to play with powerful cards in a Limited context.</p>

<p>What all of this means is that <em>Double Masters</em> sets have the ability to play around with themes which might not work in a normal set. Was there a cool theme that players liked but could be taken up a notch in this set? The Vision Design team thought so.</p>

<p><em>Shards of Alara</em> was the first set to introduce three-color drafting themes. (<em>Invasion</em> block did let you draft three-color decks, but they weren't really themed archetypally.) Its three-color themes were all arc/shard combinations. <em>Khans of Tarkir</em> introduced wedge three-color themes. Other sets would revisit three-color themes (<em>Ikoria: Lair of Behemoths</em>, <em>Streets of New Capenna</em>), but only ever five at a time. What if <em>Double Masters 2022</em> was the first set ever to let you draft all ten three-color combinations at once?</p>

<p>The Vision Design team loved the idea. It was a cool concept that would be easy to convey marketing-wise and allowed the set to take a popular theme and "notch it up." The big question: could it be done? There's a reason we'd never done it before. Draft themes need to overlap, and adding in five extra combinations would make the structure complicated to build. They were very excited though, so they decided to give it a try.</p>

<h1>"If You Build It<nbsp> . . .</nbsp>"</h1>

<p>Let me begin by explaining the complexity of the puzzle that faced the design team. When designing a draft environment, you need make sure that most of your cards are attractive to multiple drafters. An example where we messed this up was <em>Lorwyn</em>. That set had eight different creature types it cared about (Elemental, Elf, Faerie, Giant, Goblin, Kithkin, Merfolk, and Treefolk). Once you drafted a creature type, you kind of went on rails, because all you cared about were other cards with that same creature type. While there were a few things to fight over (removal spells, changelings, etc.), mostly the Elf player got all the Elf cards, and most Elf drafts ending up looking very similar because the Elf cards always went to the Elf player.</p>

<p>To combat this, we made sure that most cards were attractive to multiple archetypes. A mono-white card, for example, might be attractive to the red-white player and the white-black player, and maybe to certain green-white or white-blue decks. This means that drafts will have higher variance because the same cards aren't always going to the same archetype.</p>

<p>Why is this an issue? Well, a three-color set is going to have monocolor cards, two-color cards, and three-color cards. The three-color cards are kind of like the Elves in <em>Lorwyn </em>in that there's just one archetype that's going to draft them, but the monocolor and two-color cards need to be attractive to multiple archetypes.</p>

<p>Let's look at the ten three-color groupings. Each monocolor card potentially can go into six different three-color decks (for example, a green card goes in BRG, RGW, GWU, GWB, UBG, and GUR), and each two-color card can go into three different three-color decks (for example, green-white goes into RGW, GWU, and GWB). The challenging part is that each archetype theme must overlap with all nine other archetypes.</p>

<p>For instance, let's take white-blue-black (WUB). It overlaps in two colors with six other three-color combinations (white-blue with GWU and RWU, blue-black with UBR and BGU, and white-black with GWB and RWB) and in one color with three other three-color combinations (white with RGW, blue with GUR, and black with BRG). This means every archetype must thematically overlap with every other archetype, the majority of the time in two colors. It was a complex web that the design team wasn't even sure had an answer, but they were determined to try.</p>

<p>Before they solved that puzzle, they had to start with a different one—the mana base. How can you make it such that the three-color decks consistently have access to their mana without enabling four- and five-color decks? If mana is too easy, you end up with what we call "good stuff soup" where decks just play all the best cards in a single deck. This messes with the draft and ends up with the decks looking too similar to one another.</p>

<p>The solution ended up being using lands that only produced two colors of mana. It turns out that having two-color lands as a key part of your mana base makes three-color possible, but a stretch for four and five mana. This led to a different problem where it was difficult to make sure the players had access to the right combination of two-color lands.</p>

<p>The solution to this problem ended up coming, as solutions often do, from a completely different team. R&amp;D will occasionally put together design teams to tackle larger design issues that aren't tied to any one set. One such team was a team who was asked to figure out if there were ways to improve drafting, again not for any one specific set, but drafting as a whole. Was there anything we could do to every set that would incrementally improve the drafting experience?</p>

<p>This story isn't really about that team, so I'm not going to dive into their discoveries today, but they did come up with one idea that ended being relevant. What if after you finished the draft, you had access to a dual land that entered tapped and could choose which two colors it produced (as you built your deck, not when playing it)? Would that improve drafting? The team ended up deciding against recommending it, but the idea had been floating around R&amp;D, so when Bryan and his Set Design team were trying to solve their mana problem, it came up as a potential solution.</p>

<p>There were issues with it. It was a new card in a product that was all reprints. It would have to show up in a large volume. It required a card decision during deck building that was somewhat new. In the end, they thought it showed merit and decided to try it out. They chose to put one in every pack (I think it started as the fifteenth card, but that would change to the sixteenth later) and playtested it. It ended up working well, and it was officially added to the file in early set design.</p>

<p>Now came the archetype puzzle. The key to solving this was a slow, incremental process. They picked themes for each archetype, did the best they could to overlap themes on monocolor and two-color cards, and then playtested. They would then take all the playtest feedback to see which themes were synergistic, which were under-synergistic, and which were over-synergistic. Yes, being too mechanically synergistic is also a problem because, if two archetypes play too well with one another, it warps the draft.</p>

<p>The feedback usually ended up with two major changes. One, they could tweak an archetype theme, pushing it in a new direction; or two, they could change the cards that were designed to overlap between themes. Getting the draft environment correct involved a lot of subtle adjustments.</p>

<p>Also, remember that this is an all-reprint set (well, except for Cryptic Spires), which means that all of the work that had to be done needed to use existing cards. Often in design, when we're trying to overlap two archetypes, we can design cards that specifically fill an exact function. The <em>Double Masters 2022</em> team didn't have that option, which makes all their work even more impressive.</p>

<p>Let's walk through what themes each archetype ended up in:</p>

<p><strong>White-blue-black</strong>: This archetype is about flicker value, that is, it has a lot of creatures with "enters the battlefield" effects that you want to either flicker (exile and return to the battlefield—in white and blue), bounce (return to your hand—in blue), or raise dead (return to your hand from the graveyard—in white and black), the latter two recasting it. "Enters the battlefield" effects are particularly nice as a design tool, as you can pick the effects to match themes in other archetypes.</p>

<p><strong>Blue-black-red</strong>: This archetype is graveyard midrange. You use black's ability to get creatures back from the graveyard and blue and red's ability to get back spells to recur high-value threats and gradually overwhelm your opponent. You'll notice how pieces of overlapping archetypes make use of the same component. For example, WUB and UBR both make use of getting back creatures from the graveyard.</p>

<p><strong>Black-red-green</strong>: This archetype plays into a popular strategy known as Jund (named after the predominant strategy BRG had in original<em> Shards of Alara </em>block) where the deck utilizes high-strength creature removal and individually powerful, self-sufficient threats with some light sacrifice synergy. You can see UBR and BRG overlapping in their larger midrange creatures and some of their sacrifice themes.</p>

<p><strong>Red-green-white</strong>: This archetype is heroic aggro. By targeting your creatures with Auras and combat tricks, you generate powerful effects that help you win in combat. The key to making synergy with the aggro archetype is to pay attention to the low-mana creatures in the overlapping colors.</p>

<p><strong>Green-white-blue</strong>: This archetype is big ramp. You use spells to get access to more mana or land, which allows you to play bigger ramping spells and in turn cast big creatures or big effects that win you the game. This color combination is a bit of a departure for this theme, as ramping more likely involves red than white.</p>

<p><strong>White-black-green</strong>: This archetype is about +1/+1 counters. These are the three colors that have the most creatures and the most access to pump them up. Create an army, make them bigger, and attack for the win. This deck can go tall and wide. +1/+1 counters are nice as a theme because it's easy to make other archetypes want to use them to buff their own creatures, even if it's not part of a larger strategy.</p>

<p><strong>Blue-red-white</strong>: This is the prowess archetype. Play creatures that get rewarded whenever you play noncreature spells, especially in combat. Prowess plays particularly well in blue and red as they're the two strongest spell colors. White and red are the two best at combat tricks and having small aggressive creatures.</p>

<p><strong>Black-green-blue</strong>: This is the graveyard growth archetype. This deck gets rewarded as your graveyard gets bigger with black and green being the two best colors for caring about your graveyard. These are also the three best colors at filling up your graveyard. Black is good at sacrificing permanents and milling. Blue is good at milling, looting (drawing and discarding), and spell casting. Green is good at mulching (milling cards from your library to get bonuses for what gets milled).</p>

<p><strong>Red-white-black</strong>: This archetype is a sacrifice deck. These are the three best colors at making tokens combined with the two best colors at sacrificing creatures (black and red). The deck tends to make a lot of disposable minions that you can turn into game-winning advantage. You'll notice the sacrifice theme overlaps with a few other archetypes.</p>

<p><strong>Green-blue-red</strong>: This archetype is midrange ramp. It has access to mana and beefy creatures from red and green, card drawing from blue and green, and tempo spells from blue and red. It's a versatile deck that can make use of a lot of different types of spells.</p>

<p>As you can see, the design team worked very hard to have the themes overlap such that cards from one archetype are attractive to cards in neighboring archetypes. It was done in such a way that things should just work without the players having to be hyper aware of why the different archetypes click together. There's a lot of <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/lenticular-design-2014-12-15" target="_blank">lenticular design</a> built in where synergies will become more apparent as you play more.</p>

<p>Before I wrap up for today, I have a preview to do. As it's <em>Double Masters 2022</em>, that, of course, means there are two previews.</p>

<p>First up is a legendary creature from the plane of Ixalan, but not one from the <em>Ixalan </em>block.</p>

We recently welcomed our final set of guests, Game Designer Ellie Rice, Senior Communications Manager Greg Tito, and Community Lead Brandy Camel to talk all things D&amp;D, <em>Commander Legends: Battle for Baldur's Gate</em>, and social play. If you consider yourself a D&amp;D fan and are curious what <em>Magic</em> and this set have to offer (or vice versa!), but missed the conversation, you're in the right place. We've got the recap below:</p>

<p><strong>Brandy</strong>: Welcome, everyone, to our very first Office Hours Q&amp;A! I'm joined today by a whole lot of very cool people—but the first person I want to toss it over to is @Wotc_Athena to introduce what Office Hours is and to help us kick off our first questions!</p>

<p><strong>Athena (WoTC Moderator)</strong>: Thank you for the kind introduction, Brandy! Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I am one of the Community Managers for <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> and will be moderating this very exciting panel. We are joined today by Greg Tito, Brandy Camel, and Ellie Rice—welcome, and thank you for being here!</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Ellie</strong>: Hi, everyone! My name is Ellie, and I am a game designer for <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> on the Casual Play Design team! I am also a member of the Commander Advisory Group (which some of you have asked about) and a former content creator. I just started playing D&amp;D a couple months ago, too, so I am excited to be here.</li>
    <li><strong>Greg</strong>: Hi, all! I'm Greg Tito, senior communications manager for D&amp;D, co-host of Dragon Talk, the official D&amp;D podcast with Shelly Mazzanoble, and I've been playing <em>Magic</em> since 1994. This is going to be fun connecting D&amp;D and <em>Magic</em> fans!</li>
    <li><strong>Brandy</strong>: I think most of everyone here knows me already, but for posterity's sake—I'm Brandy Camel, the community lead for <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>! One of my main tasks is overseeing this server, but I do a lot of other cool behind-the-scenes stuff for the community like writing articles, working with our social media team, and creating cool content around upcoming releases with our partners. I've been playing D&amp;D since I could read and <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> since <em>Revised Edition</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Athena</strong>: Alright. To kick us off, what is <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>?</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Ellie</strong>: Big question! To put it simply, it's a strategy card game that started way back in the dinosaur age of the '90s and has thousands of unique cards. Players get these cards, build decks, and compete against their friends. As the game has developed, there have been a variety of different ways to play, from very competitive two-player formats to more social group games. If you want to learn a little more on how to play <em>Magic</em>, you can check out this [video]:</li>

<p><strong>Athena</strong>: Thank you! This weekend, we are releasing our newest <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> set, <em>Commander Legends: Battle for Baldur's Gate</em>. How does this relate to D&amp;D?</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Brandy</strong>: So, the cool thing about <em>Magic</em> sets is that they typically take place on a specific plane of existence. And what's cool about this set for D&amp;D players is that it's the second D&amp;D crossover set and takes place in Faerun! <em>Battle for Baldur's Gate</em> has its events and inspirations drawn from the city of Baldur's Gate, which most Forgotten Realms adventurers are <em>very well acquainted</em> with! The different cards you'll find will reference people, monsters, magic items, spells, and all kinds of other things from the <em>Baldur's Gate</em> video games as well as many of the adventures that have taken place in Faerun, like <em>Descent into Avernus.</em></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Athena</strong>: D&amp;D and <em>Magic</em> at face value seem like really different games. What's the social play crossover?</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Greg</strong>: All tabletop gaming is social almost by definition. You have to communicate with the people you're playing ANY game with in some form or another, but most of us build strong friendships around a gaming table. <em>Magic</em> does that in a more competitive way similar to games such as chess or bridge have for centuries. D&amp;D does it in a more cooperative way, which is what sets it apart, but they both share that connection of people gathering together as friends. Those same groups of friends can play board games one night, D&amp;D the next, and maybe Commander the following week, depending on the mood and what's of interest to the group! I think that's what connects all tabletop gaming together into "social play."</li>
    <li><strong>Ellie</strong>: Exactly! While tournaments and competitive settings have been a hallmark of MTG for a long time, it's actually casual players who make up the majority of our audience. Just like D&amp;D, most of our players are just friends who get together at their kitchen table and just have fun.</li>
    <li><strong>Brandy</strong>: I played pretty casually just last weekend with the Prerelease, actually! We picked up our Prerelease Packs and headed home with a friend and did some Sealed together as a group. It wasn't the "intended, structured" way to play a Prerelease, but we really just couldn't wait to dig into the cards and start getting to know them before we begin our major deck building. It was a great night with friends!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Athena</strong>: The upcoming set is named <em>Commander Legends: Battle for Baldur's Gate</em>, which begs the question—what is "Commander"?</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Ellie</strong>: Commander is one of the most popular ways to play <em>Magic</em>. It usually involves at least four people who have built a deck around a legendary creature—think like choosing your character for a D&amp;D game—that is their "commander" and battle in a turn-based, free-for-all showdown. Every game is different, and a lot of the times the goals shift depending on the players. Sometimes it's an all-out brawl, sometimes it's more a cooperative experience where players are getting to show off something cool their deck can do!<br />
    <br />
    One of my favorite ways to play is a variation of commander called Sheriff, where each player secretly gets a role. One player is the sheriff, and that's the only role that's known to everyone. Another is the deputy, whose job is to secretly help and protect the sheriff. Then you have some number of outlaws, whose goal is to take out the sheriff, and finally the renegade whose job is to be the last one standing. Its super fun and one of the many different ways to enjoy commander!</li>
    <li><strong>Brandy</strong>: I've never heard of this variation, and now I'm super interested in trying it!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Athena</strong>: What are some other <em>Magic</em> formats that might appeal to D&amp;D players?</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Greg</strong>: I think Commander is a great example of the type of play that D&amp;D fans would appreciate. Competitive Commander players are certainly out there, but its draw seems to be more about players who want to experience a "session" of play together with four or more friends, just like in D&amp;D. Strongly identifying with a particular character is also very familiar, so the commander aspect fits in perfectly. Other than Commander, I think Constructed formats in general can be played with a mind toward themes such as dastardly Rogues, or a blue Wizard counter spelling and stopping time. I've had a lot of fun imagining the type of character that would wield the spells in a particular deck. Plus, the amazing art on <em>Magic</em> cards are enough to inspire many a D&amp;D player starting up whole campaigns!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Athena</strong>: Why do <em>you</em> like both games?</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Ellie</strong>: I just started playing D&amp;D a couple months ago with some coworkers. The things that I've enjoyed the most so far is that players can really express themselves through the characters they make and the way they participate in the story. To me, <em>Magic</em> is very similar in that the decks I build and play are a way of me saying this is what I enjoy, this is the kind of fun I like to have, and these are the stories I want to tell. This is especially true for Commander, since I am focused on the experience of the game itself and if everyone is having a fun time rather than who ultimately wins.</li>
    <li><strong>Greg</strong>: I like both games because they scratch different itches. I am a strategy gamer at heart—I grew up playing games like <em>Civilization</em> (way too many hours sunk into that whole franchise), <em>Axis &amp; Allies</em> (same), and chess. And while I love the fantasy roleplaying of D&amp;D, I also love delving deep into a strategic system to create fun moves, counter my opponents, and summon big creatures like I can in <em>Magic</em>. And to be honest, I've actually been playing <em>Magic</em> longer than I have D&amp;D—I remember cracking that first beige starter set back in 1994. I fondly remember listening to Green Day's first album while learning to play <em>Magic</em> with my best friend, so it will always have a place in my heart.</li>
    <li><strong>Brandy</strong>: They each offer me a different satisfying form of play. For D&amp;D, I really enjoy the concept of cooperative storytelling and weaving this tale I get to share with my friends. I especially like making "weird" or atypical characters that don't seem to work on the surface but really come to life over a few sessions. <em>Magic</em> is a bit more competitive in nature, but I view deck building very similarly to character building. I like making atypical decks, especially if they have a funny (or punny) theme. When they actually work, it's all the more satisfying, but I also recognize I'm probably not winning any competitive tournaments anytime soon! That's okay by me; I still love getting to tell the tale of my Faerie-themed deck that cast [autocard]Fireball[/autocard] that one time. The short answer is I can create very memorable moments in both games, and I think that along with my general love of fantasy attracts me to both!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Athena</strong>: What are some of your favorite ways or techniques to use <em>Magic</em> cards in your D&amp;D games?</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Ellie</strong>: I wouldn't say I have ever used specific cards in D&amp;D games, but I am currently in a campaign set on Ravnica, one of the many planes in the <em>Magic</em> Multiverse, and all of us use our knowledge of archetypes and strategies within the game to influence our characters and the actions they take within the game. We have also used some known legendary creatures from <em>Magic</em> cards as characters we interact with during our sessions. We just finished our quest to capture the [autocard]Shattergang Brothers[/autocard], in fact, and are on our way to solving a bigger mystery.</li>
</ul>

<p class="rtecenter"><auto-card>Shattergang Brothers</auto-card></p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Brandy</strong>: I can't say that I've used <em>Magic</em> specifically in D&amp;D before, but now that the crossover is so much more direct, it's got me thinking on how I can use them as visual aids or as inspiration as a writer/designer. Often, in D&amp;D, you're really seeing the world through the words of one another and your own imaginations. But there's just so much great art in <em>Magic</em> that it's a great way to "look, this is what this looks like." There's also super-cool creature types and monsters that exist within the context of <em>Magic</em>, but not D&amp;D, and I like designing new creatures for my parties to encounter or fight. I've thought about building a "deck" of creatures to run my team through a <em>Magic</em>-themed gauntlet. That could be really fun!</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Greg</strong>: I've never done it myself, but I've heard of people using <em>Magic</em> cards as a random element in D&amp;D games. Instead of a sorcerer rolling on the Wild Magic table, for example, you could have them draw a <em>Magic</em> card and interpret what it says to D&amp;D terms. It helps if you do that game design work ahead of time, but it can also be fun to improvise in the moment based on the art, the flavor text, and the mechanics. And with the AFR [<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Adventures in the Forgotten Realms</em>] and CLB [<em>Commander Legends: Battle for Baldur's Gate</em>] cards available now, you could easily create a deck of cards of only spells that are actually in the Player's Handbook! Ooh, how about a random encounter deck comprised of the D&amp;D monsters in CLB? Now my mind is spinning with possibilities!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Athena</strong>: With two D&amp;D flavored <em>Magic</em> sets, what would you like to see next if a third D&amp;D set happens?</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Brandy</strong>: I've already alluded to how much I love Faeries as a theme in <em>Magic</em>, but I love them in D&amp;D, too, so I'd love to see some more Feywild stuff! I think there's only been two Pixies/Faeries in the D&amp;D sets so far, and the Feywild is huge and varied and could be a very cool theme to explore, especially with green-blue or blue-black decks. This is also in part my personal desire to see more Faerie commanders that suit my specific color wants, but shhhhhh.</li>
    <li><strong>Greg</strong>: Well, that's a no-brainer. Of course, I'd love to see more D&amp;D in my <em>Magic</em> cards! We've only scratched the surface on the entire multiverse of D&amp;D material available. And I can't wait to see more D&amp;D sourcebooks set on planes of <em>Magic</em>. With the planar travel of Spelljammer coming to D&amp;D in August, there's no reason why your Dungeon Master's head canon can't place worlds like Faerun and Eberron beside Ravnica and Theros!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Athena</strong>: Is there a digital way to play the upcoming set, <em>Commander Legends: Battle for Baldur's Gate</em>? Will this new set be added to <em>Magic: The Gathering Arena</em>?</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong><em>Magic</em></strong><strong> Community Account (Chris Peeler)</strong>: I'll hop in on this one, actually! I'm Chris Peeler, one of the community managers for <em>Magic</em> (despite what the fancy kinda-generic username here says). <em>MTG Arena</em> is a little out of the purview of some of the folks here, but happy to chat about it. <em>MTG Arena</em> will be releasing a companion product, <em>Alchemy Horizons: Baldur's Gate</em> this July. This set will feature many of the iconic characters and powerful spells featured in <em>Commander Legends: Battle for Baldur's Gate</em>, rebalanced for one-on-one digital play. <em>Alchemy Horizons: Baldur's Gate</em> will launch with everything you'd expect from full set releases—hundreds of new cards, a Set Mastery, Draft gameplay modes, and more. Stay tuned for more about how we brought <em>Battle for Baldur's Gate</em> to <em>MTG Arena</em> closer to the release. [Check out the <em>MTG Arena</em> blog for <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/mtg-arena-announcements-june-15-2022" target="_blank">more details on <em>Alchemy Horizons: Baldur's Gate</em></a>!]</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Athena</strong>: Circling back to the earlier introductions, @Wotc_Ellie, could you explain what the Rules Committee and Commander Advisory Group (CAG) are, and how you are involved?</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Ellie</strong>: Sure thing! So, unlike other formats, Commander was started by a group of players as a casual way for people to enjoy <em>Magic</em>. The Rules Committee (RC) is the group of people who actually created the format and are responsible for developing the rules, guidelines, and philosophy of the format. The Commander Advisory Group is a separate group of different commander players from the community that were invited by the Rules Committee to give them guidance and share their unique perspectives. The CAG doesn't make any rules or control what gets banned for example, but we do a big part in helping advise the RC on what we feel is the healthiest path moving forward. You can learn more about the RC and the CAG on the official website, <a href="https://mtgcommander.net/" target="_blank">mtgcommander.net</a>!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Athena</strong>: We are wrapping up our time here, so let's end with a few final community questions! The new card [autocard]Grell Philosopher[/autocard] is receiving lots of love. Is he a sign of what is to come for Grell in the future D&amp;D lore or just a bit of the past saying hi?</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><auto-card>Grell Philosopher</auto-card></p>

<ul>
    <li>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Brandy</strong>: The <em>Magic</em> team drew inspiration from across all sorts of areas of Faerun—including referencing the older (and upcoming) <em>Baldur's Gate</em> There are references that reach back as far as Gorion (<em>Baldur's Gate 1</em>) and as recent as Astarion (<em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>)! It's also pretty common for the <em>Magic</em> team to home in on a cool or funny concept and then<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> make an artist draw it (like Run Away Together). I think that's what happened here with [autocard]Grell Philosopher[/autocard], but you never know—maybe the idea will tickle one of our D&amp;D designers in return! So, not a specific or intentional sign, but we're not saying no.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Athena</strong>: Is there a D&amp;D set for making weapons?</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Greg</strong>: While there are no specific sets or books published for D&amp;D solely devoted to making weapons, there are rules in the <em>Dungeon Master's Guide</em> for how characters can create any magic items, including weapons and armor. It's in Chapter 9 called "Dungeon Master's Workshop," and I honestly wish more DMs used those rules to allow players to have more impact on the world they are adventuring in. <em>Xanathar's Guide to Everything</em> expands on what characters can do in downtime activities, including more on creating items but also researching spells, gambling, going on a heist, or fighting in the arena.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Athena</strong>: And finally, will there be future Q&amp;A events on this server?</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Brandy</strong>: We hope so! I think it's something we'd like to explore, especially if you all enjoyed this one. Please let us know! I can't give a specific time frame of when we might do one, but it's certainly something we're already looking into.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Athena</strong>: Alrighty, everyone! Our time here is coming to an end. I would like to thank everyone who joined us and submitted questions. And a special <em>thank you</em> to Ellie, Greg, and Brandy for taking the time to talk with us all!</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Ellie</strong>: Thanks, everyone, for all your questions! If you have any more questions for me or want to interact with me on social media, you can find me at <a href="https://twitter.com/ellieoftheveil" target="_blank">@ellieoftheveil</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Greg</strong>: That was really fun answering all these questions with you! Follow me on the Twitters for updates on D&amp;D, Dragon Talk, and other fun stuff: <a href="https://twitter.com/Gregtito" target="_blank">@Gregtito</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Brandy</strong>: This was a blast, and I hope we can find more ways to do these in the future for both <em>Magic</em> and D&amp;D-centric things. Stay tuned! If you need to find me on the socials, I do have a Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/dayntee" target="_blank">@dayntee</a> ) where I mostly post pictures of my cats and yell into the void of the internet, but otherwise I'm here doing admin things! Feel free to DM me anytime (though it may take me a hot minute to answer).</li>

<p><strong>Body Double</strong></p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Body Double" src="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=124443&amp;type=card" /><img alt="2X2 Body Double" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/2x2/en_D0eu8Kacvg.png" style="width: 223px; height: 310px;" /></p>

<p>One of the quirks of <em>Magic</em> design is that you can use components of a color to design cards that aren't of that color. The designers find this funny, so we often will design cards like this as a joke for one another. <auto-card>Body Double</auto-card> started as such a joke card. I'd realized that we could use cloning to let blue essentially reanimate a creature. Then came <em>Planar Chaos</em>. The whole gimmick of the set was that it was a set from an alternate timeline where the color pie differed from <em>Magic</em>'s current timeline. As such, we looked for ways to redistribute the mechanics such that each color still followed its philosophy but represented it differently in gameplay. It seemed like the perfect set where we could use some of these joke cards. I dusted off <auto-card>Body Double</auto-card> and added it to the set. As you can see, what I initially put in the file is shockingly close to the final card:</p>

<p class="mvtext"><strong>Death Clone</strong><br />
4U<br />
Creature — Clone<br />
As ~ comes into play, you may choose a creature card in a graveyard. If you do, ~ comes into play as a copy of that creature card.</p>

<p>Other than the creature type changing (Clones were creature type Clone early in the game), the card was pretty much "brain to print" as we call it in R&amp;D. Here's the art description for the original card:</p>

<p class="mvtext"><strong>Art Description</strong><br />
Color: Blue<br />
Location: Your choice<br />
Action: This shapeshifting creature takes the form of another creature, but only if that creature is now gone. Show a leafy, verdant treefolk of your design, and show the long-dead, dried-out, fallen treefolk at its feet almost like a shadow. Feel free to add some slight indication that the living treefolk is a shapeshifter.<br />
Focus: The living copy of the dead treefolk<br />
Mood: A cold duplicate.<br />
Notes: Do your best to design a cool-looking treefolk. We don't want just a tree with a face on it.</p>

<p>And here's the art description for the art they used on the <em>Double Masters 2022</em> version of the card:</p>

<p class="mvtext"><strong>Art Description</strong><br />
NO SPECIFIC SETTING OR STYLEGUIDE<br />
Color: Blue Creature<br />
Location: A sparse sculptor's workshop.<br />
Action: A human-looking female (shapeshifter) stands in front of a stone wall where dozens of realistic masks hang in ordered rows. The masks can resemble human and humanoid creatures (give us a good mix please). The female figure has her head bowed slightly as she places a mask upon her face. The room is lit by moonlight perhaps coming in from a skylight.<br />
Focus: The female shapeshifter<br />
Mood: I am who I pretend to be.</p>

<p>Looking back, I regret making <auto-card>Body Double</auto-card>, as well as <em>Planar Chaos</em> entirely. As my blog has taught me, it's hard to communicate that "this isn't what <em>Magic </em>actually does" when you print cards that do it. To this day, I get players using <em>Planar Chaos</em> cards as proof that a color can do something in color pie. So, enjoy <auto-card>Body Double</auto-card>, as I don't expect us to make any more blue "reanimation." (R&amp;D policy states that it's okay to reprint color pie breaks as long as they aren't introducing it to a format that doesn't already have it.)</p>

<p><strong>Figure of Destiny</strong></p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Figure of Destiny" src="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=158106&amp;type=card" /><img alt="2X2 Figure of Destiny" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/2x2/en_UbYZiSS61W.png" style="width: 223px; height: 310px;" /></p>

<p>This card is the brainchild of Brian Tinsman. We were working on the design of <em>Eventide</em>, and Brian turned in the following card:</p>

<p class="mvtext"><strong>Evolving Warrior</strong><br />
(r/w)(r/w)<br />
Enchantment<br />
(r/w): CARDNAME is a 2/2 Warrior until end of turn.<br />
(r/w)(r/w)(r/w): If CARDNAME is a Warrior, it gains creature type Spirit, gets +2/+2, and gains first strike until end of turn.<br />
(r/w)(r/w)(r/w)(r/w)(r/w): If CARDNAME is a Spirit, it gains creature type Avatar, gets +4/+4 and gains flying until end of turn.</p>

<p>I had a chance to ask Brian what his inspiration for <auto-card>Figure of Destiny</auto-card> was. Here's what he had to say:</p>

<p>"I was looking for a card that tells a story, and even better, lets the player participate in the story. This character is a hero, but only because you helped him along the journey! I was also enjoying the idea of using multiple additive creature types as anchors for abilities. I don't think that had been done before. I was concerned its heavy text might be too cumbersome, but playtesters got the concept right away and it became a favorite with the team."</p>

<p>The card was quirky but instantly lovable. At the time, <em>Magic</em> had had creatures that upgraded once, with something like threshold, but never multiple times (other than just gaining +1/+1 counters, I guess). Brian wanted a creature that changed three different times. The basic mechanics were there from the beginning. As Brian referenced, the card gains creature types, allowing it to be affected by the next activation.</p>

<p>Brian turned the card in as an enchantment, but I quickly changed it to a creature, which allowed us to go from 1/1 to 2/2 to 4/4 to 8/8, doubling in size each time. The creature, as printed, ended up as an 8/8 Spirit Warrior Avatar with first strike and flying, but the activation costs, the template, and when the abilities are gained changed throughout design. It's another example of a card that was close in its first incarnation to what it would become.</p>

<p>The more interesting story about this card had to do with a fight over something that didn't even end up on the card. Brian made the choice to create permanent changes that weren't indicated anywhere on the card. Usually when we permanently change the size of a creature, we use +1/+1 counters. The rules manager at the time, Mark Gottlieb, felt strongly that we should template the card using counters, because that was how <em>Magic</em> templating did this. (I do want to stress that it's the rules manager's job to try and get cards templated the way we template every other card that's similar, so Mark was doing what he was supposed to be doing.) Brian, though, really didn't want to use +1/+1 counters. In the end, I think Brian won out, but only because the rules text didn't fit if it used the +1/+1 counter rules text.</p>

<p>The popularity of <auto-card>Figure of Destiny</auto-card> inspired Brian to create the level-up mechanic in <em>Rise of the Eldrazi</em> a few years later.</p>

<p>Here's the art description for the original card:</p>

<p class="mvtext"><strong>Art Description</strong><br />
Color: Red and white creature<br />
Location: None<br />
Action: This is an abstract piece that depicts a kithkin whose spirit will go on to do great things once he dies. Show an ordinary male kithkin. Looming just above and behind him is his ghostly self, arms spread slightly. Just beyond that is his warrior-spirit self, stronger and more noble, and less "human"—less distinct facial features—wielding a sword. Beyond the warrior-spirit self is the avatar self, a majestic spirit that is grander and more ethereal/abstract than all the rest, wielding a grand ghost-sword.<br />
Focus: The creature starts as an ordinary kithkin, so that should be the most distinct.<br />
Mood: Evolving into ghostly greatness<br />
Notes: Four silhouettes, one in front of the other, ranging in "grandiosity" from a simple kithkin to a great ghost-avatar.</p>

<p><strong>Necrotic Ooze</strong></p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Necrotic Ooze" src="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=207876&amp;type=card" /><img alt="2X2 Necrotic Ooze" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/2x2/en_3fllEPRfUK.png" style="width: 223px; height: 310px;" /></p>

<p><auto-card>Necrotic Ooze</auto-card>'s story starts in the design of <em>Dissension</em>. We were designing the Simic and knew we wanted one of the legendary creatures to be an experiment. The Simic love experimentation, so it seemed like it would be cool for one of their experiments to become famous.</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><auto-card>Experiment Kraj</auto-card></p>

<p>The Simic had a "+1/+1 counters matter" theme, so we thought it would be cool that it got the keyword abilities of any creature you controlled with a +1/+1 counter on it. It turns out that outside of acorn cards, you can't just say "keyword abilities"; you have to actually spell them out, which is why the first version of the card looked like this:</p>

<p class="mvtext"><strong>Experiment #247C</strong><br />
2GGUU<br />
Legendary Creature — Mutant Ooze<br />
4/6<br />
T: Put a +1/+1 counter on target creature. As long as another creature with a +1/+1 counter on it has flying, CARDNAME has flying. The same is true for fear, first strike, double strike, landwalk, protection, trample, and vigilance. CARDNAME has all activated abilities of creatures with +1/+1 counters on them. (If any of the abilities use those creatures' names, use this creature's name instead.)</p>

<p>First off, yes, those were the evergreen abilities when <em>Dissension</em> came out. This version ended up being a bit wordy, so we switched it from copying keyword mechanics to copying activated abilities as that required fewer words. We do occasionally make cards with the above template, but I think there were enough activated abilities on Simic cards that we felt comfortable with copying activated abilities.</p>

<p>Anyway, <auto-card>Experiment Kraj</auto-card> came out and was a huge hit. I really enjoyed how the card played, so I tucked it away in my memory as a card that I'd like to tweak in the future. A big part of being a good <em>Magic</em> designer is being aware of what we've already done that was successful and finding ways to design new cards inspired by those cards, but with some changes that make them feel like their own cards. Players sometimes argue with me that copying popular cards makes those original cards less special, but we make a game that constantly creates new designs. We don't have the luxury of taking a cool design component and abandoning it to a single card.</p>

<p>For example, if we never copied <auto-card>Mistform Ultimus</auto-card>, we wouldn't have the changeling mechanic. (And that was something players complained about when <em>Lorwyn</em> came out.) However, we try to make each design feel special.</p>

<p>Cut to <em>Scars of Mirrodin</em> design. The set has a graveyard theme, so it occurs to me that it might be fun to take <auto-card>Experiment Kraj</auto-card> and have it care about the graveyard rather than other creatures with +1/+1 counters. Here's my initial design:</p>

<p class="mvtext"><strong>Zombie Kraj</strong><br />
1BB<br />
Creature — Ooze<br />
2/2<br />
CARDNAME has the activated abilities of all permanent cards in your graveyard.</p>

<p>You can tell from the name that I wasn't hiding the card's inspiration. I made it an Ooze because I love Oozes and flavorfully it felt like it could be an Ooze. Yes, the name and the creature type don't match, but the name wasn't evocative of what the new creature was supposed to be. In development, Aaron changed it from a 1BB 2/2 to a 2BB 4/3, but other than that he left it alone. Here's the art description for the original card:</p>

<p class="mvtext"><strong>Art Description</strong><br />
Color: Black creature<br />
Location: The Mephidross<br />
Action: Show a semitransparent, black, viscid, living ooze inching over a field of corpses. The ooze takes on attributes of the bodies it is passing over. The ooze has replicated various body parts—a jaw, a curved blade, a distorted hand, etc. We can see some half-metal bones jutting through it.<br />
Focus: The ooze.<br />
Mood: A gruesome mimicry of the dead.</p>

<p><strong>The Lieges</strong></p>

<p>For these ten card designs, our story starts with the design of original <em>Ravnica</em>. I was experimenting with how to innovate with multicolor design and stumbled upon the idea of hybrid mana. Traditional multicolor cards treated the colors as an "and," but I was intrigued by the idea of it being an "or." What if you only needed one of the two colors to play the card?</p>

<p>This allowed the card to be equally accessible in a monocolor deck of either color or a two-color deck of both colors but acted similarly to a monocolor card in a multicolor deck of only one of the colors. I fell in love with the concept, but the rest of R&amp;D wasn't quite as enamored with it as I was. I saw it as this amazing design tool, but it was originally seen more as a gimmick. I handed off the design with hybrid in it, but the development team (this predates our vision design, set design, and play design model) decided to take it out.</p>

<p><em>Ravnica</em> had a lot going on in it, so I understood why it was removed. A big part of <em>Magic</em> design is deciding if things don't fit and finding another place for them in a later design.</p>

<p>My next plan was to include hybrid mana in <em>Time Spiral</em>. (You can see my excitement for hybrid mana as I found a place to use them so quickly.) Time was breaking down, so I thought we could use hybrid as a sign that the very nature of magic was unraveling.</p>

<p>We were a few months into <em>Time</em> <em>Spiral</em>'s design when Brian Schneider, the lead developer for <em>Ravnica</em>, came to talk to me. They felt the set was a little low on splash and wanted to know if they could have hybrid mana back. It wasn't crucial to how <em>Time Spiral</em> was coming together, so I said sure. Interestingly, during those few months of having hybrid in <em>Time Spiral</em>, I started thinking about what would happen if the volume was a little higher than we'd originally planned in <em>Ravnica</em>. It just got me thinking that it would be cool one day to have a set with a high concentration of hybrid mana.</p>

<p>Flash forward about a year, and R&amp;D had been asked if we wanted to do a "fourth set" for the <em>Ravnica </em>year. We said we didn't, so we didn't plan anything. Then one day, we heard from the brand team that they decided they wanted a set in that late summer slot, and we had to quickly put one together. That ended up being <em>Coldsnap</em>.</p>

<p>It was designed very quickly. I believe we had a month on it, which, for <em>Magic</em> design, is insanely fast. It did have a full, normal development cycle. After we finished <em>Coldsnap</em>, I told Bill Rose (the VP of R&amp;D at the time, now the VP of tabletop <em>Magic</em>) that the next time we want to have a four-set <em>Magic</em> "year," let me know and I'd make something more cohesive, where it all felt like a singular thing, something we planned, rather than thrown together. Right before <em>Lorwyn</em> was set to start design, Bill came to me and said, "Okay. I need a four-set year."</p>

<p>My idea was two mini two-set blocks where each set had its own mechanical identity, but they were synergistic with one another. I worked with the creative team to come up with a plane that went through a major metamorphosis. <em>Lorwyn </em>had already been tagged as a creature type–focused set, so the challenge was to find a mechanical theme for <em>Shadowmoor</em>. I needed it to care about something that <em>Lorwyn </em>would naturally contain, just as the specific creature types were something that <em>Shadowmoor </em>could easily include. It was then that I realized that quality could be color. A "colors matter" set would be something unique to <em>Shadowmoor</em> but relevant to <em>Lorwyn</em>. And I had the perfect tool for a colors-matter set—hybrid mana. It allowed you to play cards of another color in your deck without requiring the mana. Perfect.</p>

<p>I approached <em>Shadowmoor</em> with the idea that I wanted as high of an as-fan for hybrid mana as the set could hold. At the time, I concluded that was seven (i.e., half the booster pack, minus the basic land). With 20/20 hindsight, that a was a little too high, but I get that I was trying to push boundaries.</p>

<p>Anyway, once we had a hybrid-focused set, we were looking for cycles to hammer home what cool things hybrid could do. The earliest version of the Lieges generated effects based on using certain colors of creatures. Each color granted a different ability, allowing you to grant both abilities to creatures of both colors. Here's the earliest version of <auto-card>Thistledown Liege</auto-card> as an example:</p>

<p class="mvtext"><strong>Kithkin Coordinator (version #1)</strong><br />
3(w/u)<br />
Creatrure — Kithkin Wizard<br />
1/4<br />
Whenever a white creature you control is tapped, gain 1 life.<br />
Whenever a blue creature you control is the target of a spell or ability, tap or untap target creature.</p>

<p>As you can see, the mana cost just required a single hybrid mana and generated spell-like effects rather than enhancing the creatures. The impetus behind this cycle was playing more into the "colors matter" space, as cards could be colors that their controllers didn't have mana available for, allowing interesting combinations.</p>

<p class="mvtext"><strong>Kithkin Coordinator (version #2)</strong><br />
3(w/u)<br />
Creatrure — Kithkin Wizard<br />
1/4<br />
Whenever a white creature you control becomes untapped, it gets +1/+1 until end of turn.<br />
Whenever a blue creature you control becomes tapped, it gains shroud until end of turn.</p>

<p>The next version shifted more toward granting the creatures abilities. I think this was the version handed off in design.</p>

<p><em>Shadowmoor</em> development, led by Aaron Forsythe, decided to make these much simpler. Inspired by <auto-card>Tolsimir Wolfblood</auto-card> from original <em>Ravnica</em>, the cycle was changed to a simpler formula. Each creature would have two abilities granting +1/+1 to each of its colors, which meant it would grant +2/+2 to any creature of both colors. We then gave each creature an ability. Three creatures got a keyworded ability (white-blue got flash, blue-back got flying, and red-green got trample), and two had an ability that was spelled out. Black-red got a precursor to ward, and green-white got an anti-discard rider. I'm not sure why it didn't get vigilance. We'd just added vigilance to green the year before in <em>Future Sight</em>. My best guess is that Standard had a strong discard spell in it that R&amp;D wanted to react to.</p>

<p>All the <em>Shadowmoor </em>creatures were costed at 1HHH (H is the symbol we use to represent "unspecified hybrid mana"), but their power and toughness varied based on how aggressive the color got to be on creatures and on what their noncreature-boosting ability was. They were all flavored as Knights and reflected whatever creature type was core to that two-color combination (white-blue—Kithkin; blue-black—Faerie; black-red—Elemental; red-green—Goblin; and green-white—Elf).</p>

<p>The reason their mana cost had so much hybrid mana in it was because we were trying to be careful of how easy they were to splash in decks playing other colors. There was a lot of experimentation in the set about seeing how many mana symbols we could include. <em>Eventide</em> would have the chroma mechanic, the precursor to devotion, so having a lot of mana symbols would be mechanically relevant in Standard.</p>

<p>When we made <em>Eventide</em>, we decided to make the set about the enemy colors to allow us to make more hybrid cards (as we'd taxed out most of the design space for allied hybrid). We talked about whether we needed to make the enemy cycle of the Lieges but decided players would be upset if we didn't.</p>

<p>We quickly ran into several issues. One, we found it problematic to make five more cards at exactly 1HHH that didn't feel too close to the first five, so we ended up allowing them to be anywhere from 1HHH to 3HHH. Two, there weren't creature types as neatly lined up for the enemy color combinations as there had been for the ally ones, so the solution was to make them all Horrors. This also let them look a bit different than the ally versions, as they weren't Knights riding something. We allowed ourselves to make the extra ability a bit more complex on the enemy versions. The one mechanical thing tying them together is that they cared about the two colors in some way. Two of them cared about when you cast certain colors of spells (white-black and red-white), two affected things of the particular colors (blue-red and green-blue), and one made creature tokens of both colors (black-green).</p>

<p>I believe the Lieges are the only full ten-card cycle to be included in <em>Double Masters 2022</em>.</p>

This set has cards from all over <em>Magic</em>'s history, so over the next two weeks, I'll be looking back at a lot of old designs.</p>

<p><strong>Bitterblossom</strong></p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Bitterblossom" src="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=152648&amp;type=card" /><img alt="2X2 Bitterblossom" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/2x2/en_prhbWT47wv.png" style="width: 223px; height: 310px;" /></p>

<p>First, I want to talk about <auto-card>Bitterblossom</auto-card>, originally designed in <em>Morningtide</em>. It was part of the <em>Lorwyn</em> mini-block, which was focused on creature types as its major theme. One of the supported creature types was Faeries, which in<em> Lorwyn</em>, were blue and black. They all needed to fly, which limited us to white, blue, and black, and since they were supposed to be kind of mean and nasty, the villains of the story, blue and black felt like the right color combination. Faeries were the most Spike-oriented creature type, so we were more tournament-conscious about them than any other creature type. Faeries did go on to see a lot of play in Standard and other competitive formats. This slot was designated for a Faerie card.</p>

<p class="mvtext" style="margin-right: 25px; margin-left: 24px;"><strong>Ritual of Massacre (version #1)</strong><br />
4BB<br />
Sorcery<br />
Each creature gets -2/-2 until end of turn. Until end of turn, draw a card for each creature put into a graveyard from play.</p>

<p>The first stab at the card was a powerful kill card. It killed small things and gave you some card advantage. It was an odd fit for Faeries, though, as Faeries tend to be on the smaller side, so the design team decided it needed a whole new design.</p>

<p class="mvtext"><strong>Grasp of the Faerie Queen (version #2)</strong><br />
XBB<br />
Sorcery<br />
Put X 1/1 black Faerie Rogues with flying into play.</p>

<p>The next attempt had the potential to make the player a lot of Faerie tokens. My best guess was this made too many Faeries too fast and just won the game if the opponent didn't have an immediate answer to a swarm of small fliers.</p>

<p class="mvtext"><strong>Violet Tendencies (version #3)</strong><br />
1B<br />
Tribal Enchantment — Faerie<br />
B: Put a 1/1 black Faerie Rogue creature token with flying into play and return CARDNAME to its owner's hand. Play this ability as a sorcery.<br />
Sacrifice three Faeries: Destroy target creature.</p>

<p>The next version tried to combine aspects of both versions of the card. What if the card that made Faerie tokens also gave you a way to kill creatures. To slow down the Faerie production, the card only created one Faerie at a time and basically cost 1BB to make each additional Faerie. Make enough faeries, and you could use them to destroy the opponent's creatures. I'm not sure why there was no mana gate (i.e., cost) on the second activation. Nowadays, we'd have added that. Anyway, the team playtested this card a lot, and it was just a very unfun card. Many designers championed its destruction.</p>

<p>Here's where I come into the story. In <em>Apocalypse</em>, I'd designed a card called <auto-card>Phyrexian Arena</auto-card>, which was an enchantment that let a black mage draw a card each turn. Because black card draw comes at a cost, you lose 1 life each turn when you draw the card.</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><auto-card>Phyrexian Arena</auto-card></p>

<p>I'd really liked the design, and it had seen a lot of play, so I suggested we make a <auto-card>Phyrexian Arena</auto-card> for Faeries. It was simple and felt like a good addition for the Faerie deck, so I managed to get enough designers on board to get it into the set. It played well, so it stayed. As time would show, it ended up being a strong card. Before I move onto the next card, here's the art description for the card. The art descriptions back then were often a bit shorter.</p>

<p class="mvtext"><strong>Art Description</strong><br />
Color: Black spell<br />
Action: Show a sea of purple and blue flowers that have mostly engulfed some trees in a marsh at early sunset. From the climbing masses of flowers have risen several (at least three) black-aligned faerie assassins looking casual, cool, and deadly.</p>

<p><strong>Venser, Shaper Savant</strong></p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Venser, Shaper Savant" src="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=136209&amp;type=card" /><img alt="2X2 Venser, Shaper Savant" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/2x2/en_ilZ7wfZP1x.png" style="width: 223px; height: 310px;" /></p>

<p><em>Time Spiral</em> block was about an event called The Mending, which was designed to revamp how planeswalkers worked, taking them from godlike powers to something a bit more relatable. Venser was one of our newer characters, who at the start of the story wasn't a planeswalker, that we planned to turn into one of our revamped planeswalkers. In fact, in <em>Future Sight</em>, we were originally planning to introduce planeswalkers as a card type (in a futureshifted frame), and Venser was one of the first three ever planned planeswalker cards (the other two colors being blue and black). Here's the earliest Venser we have in the file:</p>

<p class="mvtext"><strong>Venser (version #1)</strong><br />
5U<br />
Planeswalker<br />
Loyalty &lt;8&gt;<br />
1. Target player draws 2 cards. -2 Loyalty<br />
2. Target player gains control of target artifact or creature with converted mana cost less than or equal to the number of cards in your hand. -2 Loyalty</p>

<p>Here's how planeswalkers worked at the time. Venser would enter with eight loyalty. Turn one, he would let target player, usually you, draw two cards and would lose two loyalty. Turn two, he would let target player, again usually you, gain control of an artifact or creature whose mana value was equal to or less than the number of cards in your hand and he'd lose two loyalty. Turn three, he'd let target player draw two more cards and he'd lose two more loyalty. Turn four, he'd steal another artifact or creature and he'd lose two more loyalty. That would be his last two loyalty, and the card would go away. Now the opponent could attack him, causing him to lose loyalty and accelerate his exit from the game. Since loyalty was part of the effect and not a cost, he could do an effect with only one loyalty.</p>

<p>R&amp;D wasn't happy with how this incarnation was playing. It was a little too robotic (the planeswalkers didn't have any sense of agency) and didn't give the player any means to gain loyalty. We would decide to pull the planeswalkers from the set, giving ourselves more time to work on them (with just a subtle nod to the new card type on Tarmogoyf's reminder text). Part of this early planeswalker design would later be used to make Sagas. (Being prescriptive made a lot more sense for a story than a person.) Even though planeswalker Venser wasn't in the set, Venser played a big role in the story, so we still wanted him to have a card. Here's our first attempt at a legendary creature version:</p>

<p class="mvtext"><strong>Venser (version #2)</strong><br />
1UU<br />
Legendary Creature — Human Wizard<br />
2/2<br />
Flash<br />
1UU: Return Venser to its owners hand. You may play this ability while Venser is in play, in your graveyard, on the stack or removed from the game.</p>

<p>I'm not sure what inspired this version. The return from the battlefield and the stack are both blue effects (the latter being odd but basically stopping counterspells). We don't do a lot of returning from exile, but returning yourself I guess could be blue. Returning yourself from your graveyard is black and green (and red on Phoenixes) but not blue. I think the biggest issue with this version is that it didn't capture Venser's magic, which was teleportation. The next version tried to hit that flavor stronger:</p>

<p class="mvtext"><strong>Venser, Master Teleporter (version #3)</strong><br />
4UU<br />
Legendary Creature — Human Wizard<br />
2/2<br />
Flash<br />
When Venser, Master Teleporter comes into play, target creature's owner shuffles it into his or her library.<br />
U: Venser is unblockable this turn.<br />
2U: Return Venser to its owner's hand.<br />
0: Venser's owner shuffles it into his or her library.</p>

<p>This design was all about capturing the flavor of teleportation in <em>Magic</em> effects. Venser could teleport himself past blockers—unblockability. Venser could teleport things away—shuffle into library and bounce. Venser could teleport himself away to save himself—self-shuffling. In retrospect, shuffling into library is not in blue's pie as it's too close to removal for blue. Self-shuffling is probably okay. If we did this version today, it would probably put the creature on top of its owner's library or maybe a few cards down.</p>

<p>In the end, the card kept the flash and moved the bounce effect to the "enters the battlefield" ability. I think the "bounce a spell" portion had been used on a different card, and we realized we could fold it into the bounce ETB effect to make the card more novel. Venser would finally get a planeswalker card in <em>Scars of Mirrodin</em>, and you can see traces of that card's design in the above version.</p>

<p><strong>Gifts Ungiven</strong></p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Gifts Ungiven" src="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=79090&amp;type=card" /><img alt="2X2 Gifts Ungiven" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/2x2/en_5uC2y4Xr4f.png" style="width: 223px; height: 310px;" /></p>

<p><auto-card>Gifts Ungiven</auto-card> first appeared in <em>Champions of Kamigawa</em>, but the origin of this card's design goes all the way back to <em>Tempest</em>. I had a cool idea for a spell that let you tutor (i.e., get a card from your library) three different spells, and your opponent got to choose which one you got to put into your hand. The rest went to your graveyard. The card was printed as <auto-card>Intuition</auto-card>.</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><auto-card>Intuition</auto-card></p>

<p>So, we were playtesting Constructed decks with <em>Tempest </em>(back in the day, I did a lot of development in addition to design), and I was playing against one of the other designers, I believe it was Mike Elliott, and he casts <auto-card>Intuition</auto-card>. He then goes into his deck and gets three copies of the same card. Here's our conversation:</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;"><strong>Me</strong>: Mike, you can't get three copies of the same card.<br />
<strong>Mike</strong>: No, I can. It doesn't say I can't.<br />
<strong>Me</strong>: I mean that's not what the card's supposed to do. The intent is that it's three different cards.<br />
<strong>Mike</strong>: That's not what the card says.<br />
<strong>Me</strong>: Yes, I understand it's written incorrectly. I, the designer of the card, am explaining the design intent, which is what we should be playtesting.<br />
<strong>Mike</strong>: I think it's better as is.<br />
<strong>Me</strong>: Why are we bothering to make the opponent choose one if they're all the same?<br />
<strong>Mike</strong>: That's the cool part. You can make it so they can't pick.<br />
<strong>Me</strong>: If I wanted the card to get three copies of the same card and put one in your hand and two in the graveyard, that's what I would have had the card do. The whole point of having the opponent choose is to create this fun moment where they have to figure out what you're up to. It's a cool Spike moment.<br />
<strong>Mike</strong>: Nah, I like it as is.</p>

<p>I took the issue to the development team, and the majority decided to keep it as is. The card was seeing a lot of play in the Future Future League, and so the decision was not to change it. I obviously wasn't happy about that decision. So, flash forward a couple years, and I was designing cards for <em>Champions of Kamigawa</em>. Here's the card I turned in:</p>

<p class="mvtext"><strong>Fixed <auto-card>Intuition</strong><br />
1UU<br />
Sorcery<br />
Search your library for three cards with different names and reveal them to all players. Target opponent chooses one of the revealed cards. Put the chosen card into your hand and the rest into your graveyard. Shuffle your library afterwards.</p>

<p>I'm not sure why I changed it from 2U to 1UU. I assume I was worried about the power level (although not my area of strength). The card goes in the file and the development team changed it from getting three cards and the opponent chooses one to getting four and the opponent chooses two to distance it from <auto-card>Intuition</auto-card>. So finally, years later, I get my card the way I designed it. Here's the art description for the original card:</p>

<p class="mvtext"><strong>Art Description</strong><br />
Color: Blue<br />
Location: Inside the moonfolk cloud palace<br />
Action: In a fancy chamber, the female moonfolk prophet Uyo, in a beautiful kimono, kneels behind a short table covered with a silk cloth. On the table sit four different netsuke (small figurines), different colors and shapes—they can be almost anything. Uyo looks placidly at the viewer, awaiting a choice.<br />
Notes: LINK to 80913. A Google image search for "netsuke" will point you in the right direction.</p>

<p>Here's the art description for the art used in <em>Double Masters 2022</em>, originally from <em>Signature Spellbook: Jace</em>:</p>

<p class="mvtext"><strong>Art Description</strong><br />
*PLANESWALKER *JACE<br />
Setting: NOT SETTING SPECIFIC<br />
Color: Blue spell<br />
Location: Unimportant/abstract<br />
Action: This is a weird DOUBLE IMAGE of the Planeswalker JACE BELEREN. The two images of Jace are both equally "real," but they partially overlap. They should be separate enough that we get two full images of Jace's face and outstretched hand. In both images, Jace's hood is up, his face only partly visible, but we can see that he's smirking a bit. Both Jaces reach a hand toward us, offering something. They're offering different objects—say, a scroll and a gem—and that's the only difference between the two images.<br />
Focus: The double Jaces and their gifts<br />
Mood: Confused? Good.</p>

<p><strong>Mulldrifter</strong></p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Mulldrifter" src="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=145811&amp;type=card" style="width: 223px; height: 310px;" /><img alt="2X2 Mulldrifter" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/2x2/en_6zHpnhCKLw.png" style="height: 310px; width: 223px;" /></p>

<p>The evoke mechanic has an interesting story, one tied to <auto-card>Mulldrifter</auto-card> as it was the very first card I made with the mechanic. Watching its design shift over time does a good job of explaining evoke's evolution. The mechanic first came about because I was trying to solve the following puzzle: we were designing <em>Lorwyn</em> as a creature-focused set focused on creature types. The set wanted to have a spell mechanic. Was there a way to make a creature-focused spell mechanic? After some thought, I came up with a cool idea, what I called manifest.</p>

<p class="mvtext"><strong>Inspiring Essence (version #1)</strong><br />
1UU<br />
Tribal Sorcery — Elemental<br />
2/2<br />
Draw two cards. Manifest 3 (You may pay 3 as this spell resolves. If you do, put it into play as a creature.)<br />
-------------------------------- Flying</p>

<p>The idea was a simple one. What if you had instants and sorceries that you could "kick" (pay extra mana for) to turn them into creatures? <em>Lorwyn</em> was already making use of the tribal card type, so that would let us designate the spell as a certain creature type. The plan was that the manifest cost could change from creature to creature, which would allow us to vary how big the body and the abilities of the creature were. As with anything requiring a new frame, the file just listed what we needed, assuming we'd figure out the frame later. As you can see, my very first stab was a 2/2 flying blue creature that drew you two cards. The cost wasn't the same (1UU/4UU versus 2U/4U), but it was close.</p>

<p>The reason I started it as a spell was that I envisioned this mechanic as the coolest if you could turn a spell into a creature. That seemed more evocative and splashier. Well, it turns out that the game really doesn't like having instants and sorceries on the battlefield. The rules do everything they can to keep that from happening, and I believe if you somehow do it anyway, the game immediately gets rid of it, putting it into the graveyard. That meant we couldn't do manifest as envisioned. That led to our next attempt:</p>

<p class="mvtext"><strong>Inspiring Essence (version 2)</strong><br />
4UU<br />
Creature — Elemental<br />
2/2<br />
Flying<br />
When CARDNAME comes into play, draw two cards.<br />
Discount 3 (You may play this creature for o3 less. If you do, sacrifice it when it comes into play.)</p>

<p>If we wanted the card to sometimes be a creature, it turned out to be easiest if it was always a creature. To mimic the spell portion of the card, we could make the effect an "enters the battlefield" effect (at the time, a "comes into play" effect) on the creature and then have the creature be sacrificed if you didn't pay the additional mana.</p>

<p>The first stab at this new version was called discount, and it gave the creature a spell reduction, but one that came at the cost of sacrificing the creature. As you can see, this change just mirrored the previous version, so it was still 1UU for just the "spell" and 4UU for the "spell" and the "creature."</p>

<p class="mvtext"><strong>Notion Glider (version 3)</strong><br />
5U<br />
Creature — Elemental<br />
2/2<br />
Flying<br />
When CARDNAME comes into play, draw two cards.<br />
Expedite 2U (You may play this creature for o2oU. If you do, sacrifice it when it comes into play.)</p>

<p>We then realized it was easier to simply show the alternate cost rather than have the player do the math. Discount thus became expedite and eventually evoke. The development team played around with both the mana cost and the evoke cost, but the card was always a 2/2 flyer that drew you two cards throughout its existence.</p>

<p>I would share the art description with you, but it sadly wasn't in our database.</p>

For our readers and preview seekers, we've created this handy guide to preview season.</p>

<p>We'll get the party started with the Weekly MTG stream on June 16 at 9:00 a.m. PT. Be sure to tune in to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Magicthegathering" target="_blank">official <em>Magic: The Gathering </em>YouTube channel</a> or <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/magic" target="_blank">twitch.tv/magic</a> and get your first deep dive into the cards returning when <em>Double Masters 2022</em> arrives July 8.</p>

<p><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/66nbL00FcAQ" width="560"></iframe></p>

<p>Then we'll show you even more to come right here on DailyMTG—and beyond—with previews being shared across the <em>Magic</em> world.</p>

<p>Whether you want to follow or avoid the latest previews, this page will help you track everything coming by sharing where upcoming <em>Double Masters 2022</em> previews are planned on each day.</p>

<p>Below, you'll find a list of dates as well as any outlets previewing a card on that date. After the previews are live, we'll update this article so that you can easily find them. If the link simply goes to the front of a website or social media site, that means they probably haven't previewed the card yet.</p>

<p>And if you just want to see all the cards that have been officially previewed in one place, you can always check out our Card Image Gallery and our Variant Card Image Gallery after day one of previews. (We'll link the galleries up when they go live on June 16.) Note that these galleries are updated every morning, Monday through Friday, so they contain all cards previewed the previous day (and earlier), but not the day of.</p>

<p>For the most up-to-date listings, bookmark this page and check back regularly for all the latest previews from <em>Double Masters 2022</em>!</p>

With <a href="https://magic.gg/news/return-of-the-pro-tour-your-path-to-playing-magic-at-the-highest-level" target="_blank"> the return of the Pro Tour and high-level tabletop play</a>, <em>MTG Arena</em> had an opportunity to update its role in the greater Premier Play system—while also offering its own unique events for digital players.</p>

<p>Alongside new events, we are refreshing how the <em>MTG Arena</em> competitive path works. During the past two years, playing the ranked ladders has been the primary way for a player to begin their competitive journey. As part of reworking our system, and looking to offer a greater variety of paths, we're de-emphasizing ladder play while creating new, flexible pathways for players to find their competitive footing on <em>MTG Arena</em>. Whether you play daily or only once in a while, we hope to have a competitive path that works for you.</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Graphic" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/pU38snweyD.jpg" /></p>

<p>Let's dig into the details, starting at the top:</p>

<h2>WELCOME TO THE ARENA CHAMPIONSHIP</h2>

<p>The new top rung on the <em>MTG Arena</em> competitive track is the Arena Championship! Arena Championships will happen three times per year, just like the new Pro Tour.</p>

<p>Each Championship will feature 32 top players, determined by four months' worth of competitive ladder and event play, competing for a $200,000 prize pool.</p>

<p>Arena Championships will mark the pinnacle of competition within <em>MTG Arena</em>. Those players will also be competing to go to the <em>Magic</em> World Championship—each of the three winners and three runners-up of Arena Championships will also earn a seat at the most prestigious <em>Magic</em> event of the year!</p>

<p>So, how do you claim your seat at an Arena Championship? It's through a familiar path: our monthly Qualifier Weekend event.</p>

<h2>QUALIFIER WEEKEND: OUT WITH THE OLD, IN WITH THE NEW</h2>

<p>Many elements of Qualifier Weekend events on <em>MTG Arena</em> will be recognizable, but the details—and especially the stakes—are changing.</p>

<p>Players can earn their spot in Qualifier Weekends through two paths—ladder play or event play. (Find the details on this in the next section.)</p>

<p>There will be four Qualifier Weekends feeding each Arena Championship. The Qualifier Weekend itself still consists of two days of Best-of-Three matches in a shared format. Players will try to reach seven match wins before taking two match losses on each day, competing for the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Players can win up to 20,000 gems in prizes on Day 1, with those who reach seven wins also earning the ability to continue into Day 2.</li>
	<li>Players who win seven matches during Day 2 qualify for an Arena Championship. This is in effect starting with the very next Qualifier Weekend event taking place on May 28–29.</li>
	<li>After all Qualifier Weekends that feed an Arena Championship are complete, additional players will be invited to bring the event to 32 competitors. These remaining invitations will go to players with the most total match wins in those contributing Qualifier Weekend Day 2 events.</li>
	<li>Beginning in September, in addition to feeding Arena Championship events, Qualifier Weekends will also lead to tabletop play. Players who reach seven wins during Day 2 will qualify for <em>both</em> an upcoming Arena Championship on <em>MTG Arena</em> and a designated upcoming Pro Tour!</li>
</ul>

<h2>WHERE DO I START?</h2>

<p>As mentioned above, players must still earn their entry to a Qualifier Weekend, and there are now two main paths to get there.</p>

<p>The first new path to that entry is the <strong>Qualifier Play-In event</strong>. This open event allows players to earn their seat through a single session of focused play, rather than a month-long ladder climb. Each month will have <em>two</em> Qualifier Play-In opportunities:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A single-day, Best-of-One Qualifier Play-In takes place <em>one week</em> before the Qualifier Weekend. Players will need to reach six wins before taking two losses to advance.</li>
	<li>A single-day, Best-of-Three Qualifier Play-In takes place <em>one day</em> before the Qualifier Weekend. Players will need to reach four wins before taking one loss to advance.</li>
</ul>

<p>Players can enter a Qualifier Play-In with a 20,000 gold or 4,000 gem entry fee or by collecting 20 Play-In Points from regular events in <em>MTG Arena</em>. Reaching maximum wins in any evergreen Constructed event (such as a Historic event or Traditional Historic event) or in a Traditional Draft event will now award Play-In Points in addition to gems and packs. (For those new structures, see further below.)</p>

<p>Oko doesn't play that much <em>MTG Arena</em>, as his favorite format is Commander in person with friends. But he also enjoys drafting, so he knows the latest set well. He logs on Friday to play the Limited format Qualifier Play-In, and he reaches maximum wins. He then wins out on both Day 1 and Day 2 of the Qualifier Weekend, earning a seat at the next Arena Championship for his weekend's play.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Player Profile: Garruk the Grinder</strong></p>

<p>Garruk spends most of his <em>MTG Arena</em> time playing Traditional Alchemy events to build his collection. He earns maximum-win rewards frequently, sometimes multiple times in a weekend. He has collected enough Play-In Points to enter the Qualifier Play-In, but this month's format is Limited. He decides to save his points for next month when the format will be Alchemy. He expects to have enough points to enter multiple times and make sure he gets his chance at the Qualifier Weekend.</p>

<hr />
<p>The second main path to a Qualifier Weekend is still a <em>top-ranked ladder finish</em>. Players who finish in the top 250 of either the Constructed or Limited ladder at the end of a month will receive automatic entry into the next month's Qualifier Weekend. (This will now be served by an event entry token instead of a Qualifier Badge as in the past.) Players who finish in the top 1,200 of either ladder (but not the top 250) will instead receive enough Play-In Points for one entry to a Qualifier Play-In event, described above.</p>

<p><em>Note: Since play is already underway for the April 2022 ranked ladders, players who finish in the top 1,200 of either ladder during this month will still qualify directly for the Qualifier Weekend events. The May ranked ladders will be the first ones to follow the new structure. </em></p>

<p>Finally, players who reach six, seven, or eight match wins on Day 2 of an Arena Open will also earn entry to a Qualifier Weekend. (Previously, this only applied to players who won seven or eight matches.) This begins with the May 14–15 Arena Open, which will admit players to the June Qualifier Weekend (matching the May ranked ladders that will be in progress at that time). Not every Qualifier Weekend will admit players in this way since Arena Open events happen less frequently than once a month. <em> Note: For players familiar with the current system, be aware that entry to the Qualifier Weekend events will now be driven by event tokens instead of Qualifier Badges. </em></p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Player Profile: Huatli the Hopeful</strong></p>

<p>Huatli usually finishes the ranked season in the high percentages, but this month, a strong run on the last day landed her in the low 800s. She earns an entry to the upcoming Qualifier Play-In, and she chooses to play in the Best-of-One event where she feels her Dinosaurs deck will have the best opportunity to do well. She reaches maximum wins and gets into the Qualifier Weekend, but she then reaches only three wins on Day 1. She walks away with 11,000 gems in total from the two events to help fuel her play for next month when she wants to do even better.</p>

<h2>NOW YOU KNOW</h2>

<p>Time for a quick recap. The three basic steps of the competitive path on <em>MTG Arena</em> are:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Ladders and Qualifier Play-In events</li>
	<li>Qualifier Weekend events</li>
	<li>Arena Championships</li>
</ol>

<p>Doing well enough in any of these steps will take you up the path to the next step. If you keep excelling, you will find yourself at the top of the mountain—including at a tabletop Pro Tour or even the <em>Magic</em> World Championship!</p>

<h2>GETTING THE POINT</h2>

<p>Beginning with the release of <em>Streets of New Capenna</em>, evergreen Constructed events for all permanent <em>MTG Arena</em> formats will now have updated structures that incorporate Play-In Points so that players can use these events to enter the competitive path. They also now have both higher entry fees and higher rewards that replace the previous gold and individual card rewards (ICRs) with gems and packs. These changes are intended to let players build their collection through Constructed play more quickly and reliably. These are the new structures:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>For Alchemy events, packs will be of the latest Alchemy set.</li>

	</ul>
	</div>
	</div>
	</dd>
</dl>
</div>

<p>Also beginning with <em>Streets of New Capenna</em>, Traditional Drafts will have a new structure. This change reduces some of the top-heaviness of the event and incorporates Play-In Points.</p>

	<h3>Traditional Draft Structure</h3>

	</ul>

	</div>

<p>Play-In Points earned from any of these events can be combined, and players may use their Play-In Points to enter either type of Qualifier Play-In event in any month.</p>

<h2>THE BEGINNING OF THE PATH</h2>

<p>Phew, we made it to the end of the article! But really, it's just the beginning of a new competitive dream, and your path to the Arena Championships. Answers to questions, additional dates, and format details will all be available soon, and we are ready to make any needed adjustments along the way to help this path serve all of our different players. We are excited for our first Arena Championship later this year, and we hope you are, too!</p>

<p>Preorders begin tomorrow, June 23, for the exciting new set <em>Alchemy Horizons: Baldur's Gate</em>, which includes new cards, cards from <em>Commander Legends: Battle for Baldur’s Gate</em>, plus common and uncommon reprints from <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Adventures in the Forgotten Realms</em> that bring in even more D&amp;D flavor.</p>

<ul>

</ul>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/yjy4h9sm3uw.jpg" /></p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Double team </strong>– When a creature with double team attacks, if it's not a token, conjure a duplicate of the original into your hand, and then both cards lose double team.</li>
</ul>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Screenshot showing double team in action with the card Gnoll Hunting Party" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/8gv8a25e7dd.jpg" /></p>

For our readers and preview seekers, we've created this handy guide to preview season. We even kicked things off today in our weekly <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/mtg-arena-announcements-june-22-2022" target="_blank"><em>MTG Arena</em> Announcements</a>, before <em>Alchemy Horizons: Baldur's Gate</em> arrives on <em>MTG Arena</em> July 7.</p>

<p>Whether you want to follow or avoid the latest previews, this page will help you track everything coming by sharing where upcoming <em>Alchemy Horizons: Baldur's Gate</em> previews are planned on each day.</p>

<p>Below, you'll find a list of dates as well as any outlets previewing a card on that date. After the previews are live, we'll update this article so that you can easily find them. If the link simply goes to the front of a website or social media site, that means they probably haven't previewed the card yet.</p>

<p>And if you just want to see all the cards that have been officially previewed in one place, you can always check out our Card Image Gallery. (We'll link the gallery here when it goes live.) Note that these galleries are updated every morning, Monday through Friday, so they contain all cards previewed the previous day (and earlier), but not the day of.</p>

<p>For the most up-to-date listings, bookmark this page and check back regularly for all the latest previews from <em>Alchemy Horizons: Baldur's Gate</em>!</p>

<h1>Lesson #1</h1>

<p>My last article of life lessons ended with my wife being pregnant with our twins, Adam and Sarah. Last month, they graduated from high school, so suffice to say, I've had a bit of life to experience some new lessons.</p>

<p>The first lesson actually happened shortly after the last lesson of the previous column (where I told the organized play department that I had to stop attending Pro Tours). When my wife Lora and I built our first house, we knew that we would eventually have to move as the school system wasn't great. Rachel was born two years later, which started the clock of finding a new home. We had six years to find it as that's when she would start kindergarten. When we learned that we were having twins, that only sped up the issue because our first house wasn't big enough for a family of five.</p>

<p>After an exhaustive search, we ended up building a new home in a suburb of Seattle with a good school district. We were able to choose the house plan we wanted and the lot, but that meant that we had to wait for the builder to build the house from scratch. They told us it would take about a year.</p>

<p>To make sure we got our house sold in time, as the purchase of the new house was contingent on its sale, we sold it a couple months before the house was scheduled to be finished. The house sold in a weekend. Because there wasn't much time before the new house would be completed, we got an apartment for the interim. Adam and Sarah were babies sleeping in our room, so we just got a two-bedroom apartment. If you've ever built a house, you know where this story is going. Our house wasn't ready when they said it would be.</p>

<p>We knew things were going to be tight in the apartment, but it was only supposed to be for a month or two. That turned into six months. The babies turned one while we were in the apartment and started walking. And we just didn't have all the things we would normally need, both because it wouldn't fit in the apartment and because we'd packed them away assuming we could do without certain things for a month or two. Lora and I both got stir-crazy pretty quickly. One day when I was freaking out a little, Lora said something that really stuck with me:</p>

<p><strong>Sometimes on the way to beautiful, you have a lot of chaos</strong>.</p>

<p>By this, she was saying that we were in the process of building something, a new home, that would serve our family for many years. Part of getting there was going through a difficult stretch, but it was in service of that larger goal. We needed to think of the chaos as part of that journey.</p>

<p>This life lesson is very easy to apply to <em>Magic</em> design, because the same thing happens when you make a set. There are a lot of times, especially early on, when everything seems in chaos. When you look at the file and it feels like it's never going to come together. But having done this many times, I realize that an important part of the creative process is exploration. In order to find the gem of an idea, you often have to explore a lot of duds. In addition, the act of finding the tightest, cleanest execution usually requires you to start with a more complicated version.</p>

<p>One of the things I like to do is make the version that captures the feel we want no matter how complicated it is so we can playtest it and find out what parts of it are doing the most work. Then, over time, we peel away the parts that aren't adding enough, so we can get to the core of the idea.</p>

<p>Sagas are an excellent example of this process. We knew we wanted to capture the idea of a story, so we spent a lot of time trying crazier versions of it. For instance, some of the earliest Sagas looked like a game board where you moved a piece along a track. At each stage, we were able to fine-tune how we wanted to capture different elements, and with each new iteration, it got more elegant, finally ending up as the Sagas you know today. But without the game-board version, we wouldn't have found the chapters, so the chaotic element of the design was a crucial part of finding the ideal end state.</p>

<h1>Lesson #2</h1>

<p>When Adam was in elementary school, he was diagnosed with ADHD (attention deficit hyperactive disorder). His kindergarten teacher had identified that he needed testing, and it took maybe a year to get the official diagnosis. For Adam, the ADHD meant he had a big problem with focus. Sometimes he couldn't stay focused on a topic, other times he was hyperfocused and focused on something too much.</p>

<p>We were very open to whatever treatment he needed with one caveat: we didn't want to give him medication. Looking back, I'm not sure where that dictum came from. I think Lora and I had both read/seen stories about kids being improperly given drugs, and we were scared that we might be inadvertently doing that to Adam. There were a lot of treatments available that didn't involve medication, so we could just focus on those.</p>

<p>Adam got a lot of therapy, and we tried all sorts of treatments, but nothing seemed to be working. The idea of drugs popped up from time to time, but we always pushed it aside looking for other options.</p>

<p>Time went by, and while we'd found things that had a small effect, we just weren't finding the larger solution. One month, I had a conversation with three different people, two friends and a doctor, where I had a chance to talk through my fears of medication. They each explained that while medication can be used improperly, there are also lots of cases where it was the best answer for the problem and that trying it didn't mean we had to continue doing it if it wasn't working.</p>

<p>Lora and I had a long talk and decided we needed to give medication a try. Adam tried one medicine. It did wonders. We added a second one, and it was also a huge improvement. While medication alone wasn't the only answer, combined with other treatments, it proved to be the best answer for the problem. Which led me to this lesson:</p>

<p><strong>You have to be willing to question your absolutes. </strong></p>

<p>Black and white are just more comfortable than gray. Something is either right or wrong, and once you identify where it belongs, you can put it in its box and not have to think about it anymore. This lesson taught me that sometimes you do have to think about it again. Limited information can often lead you to one result where more information can lead you to a completely different decision. That means you have to be willing to requestion your assumptions.</p>

<p>This is another lesson that's very applicable to <em>Magic </em>design. Part of making a set is coming to decisions about what you do and don't want to do, but those decisions can often become absolute. For years, we didn't make a lot of legendary creatures because we didn't like the gameplay of it. Once someone played their copy, no one else could play it, making it a dead card. It wasn't until <em>Champions of Kamigawa</em> design where we said, "You know, despite it basically being a drawback, players seem to like legendary creatures. Maybe instead of just not making a lot of them, we could change the rules to make them more fun to play."</p>

<p>Likewise, we spent years making every black kill spell not hit non-black creatures, until one day we had to question, "Why are we doing this?" Richard had made [autocard]Terror[/autocard] in <em>Alpha</em> and gave it a non-black rider because it made flavor sense for that card, but somehow that became the staple for how black kill spells worked. I remember arguing in a meeting, "The color black's more than happy to kill other black creatures. It had no qualms killing anyone."</p>

<p>It's so easy to have things ingrained in the game that don't necessarily have to be that way. Other times, the game shifts in a new direction and something old that existed for a reason doesn't have that reason anymore. <em>Magic</em> design is about being willing to question decisions you've made before and overwrite them if need be. When we started <em>Innistrad </em>design, for example, the rule was we didn't make cards that mechanically cared about Humans, but I realized that would make <em>Innistrad </em>a worse set, so I got permission to change it. Rules exist for a reason, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't ever question them.</p>

<h1>Lesson #3</h1>

<p>Now, we finally get to a life lesson that came from working on <em>Magic</em> design. The set was <em>Scars of Mirrodin</em>. The original plan for the block was that it was going to be New Phyrexia for all three sets, and then in the very last set, we were going to reveal that it was the plane of Mirrodin. (Mirrodin becoming New Phyrexia had been in the plans since <em>Mirrodin </em>premiered.) I think our inspiration came from <em>Planet of the Apes</em> (spoilers) where at the end of the movie, Charlton Heston discovers the Statue of Liberty which reveals to him that the alien planet he is on is actually Earth in the future.</p>

<p>At the time, I was leading most the large sets that started the block, so that I meant I was going to design the first ever New Phyrexia set. I spent a lot of time trying to mechanically shape what it meant to be Phyrexian, but I was having problems understanding what the larger block was going to be about. What was the conflict? What was I building the block around?</p>

<p>I was really having trouble with the set, so much so that Bill Rose, then VP of R&amp;D, was worried about the design. It got so bad at one point that he made substantial changes to my design team, then gave me a six-week deadline and said if the set wasn't approved by that date, he was going to give the design to someone else. Bill had never said that to me before, so I had a crisis of confidence, something I'd never experienced as a <em>Magic</em> designer. Why was I having such a problem with the set?</p>

<p>One day, Bill said he wanted to talk with me. I asked if I could have more time, and Bill said no. We had a schedule to keep, and if I wasn't going to solve the problem, he had to make sure the new person had enough time to solve it. Then Bill gave me a little pep talk, something Bill had never done before. I guess he sensed how frustrated I was. My next life lesson came from Bill:</p>

<p><strong>Stop trying to make the thing everyone else wants you to make. Make the thing you want to make. You're at you're best when you're passionate about what you're doing. Find your passion.</strong></p>

<p>I went home for the weekend and did a lot of thinking. I came back on Monday and said, "We're making the wrong set. There's a cool story to tell, the story of Mirrodin falling to the Phyrexians, and we're choosing to start our first set after that story is already over. Let's change that." Bill signed off on that change and the whole block came together.</p>

<p>This lesson isn't hard to tie to <em>Magic</em> design, as it came from <em>Magic</em> design. It's an important lesson though, one that shaped me as a designer. With every set I lead, I always ask myself, where's my passion in what I'm doing? What about the current design excites me? Why am I the best person to make this design? If I, as the lead designer, am not excited about what I'm doing, how can I expect anyone else to be? People always ask me why I'm so excited when I talk about any set I work on, and the reason for that is, I make sure that everything I make is exciting for me. My goal is to make a set people can fall in love with, and that has to start with me.</p>

<h1>Lesson #4</h1>

<p>The next story happened when Rachel was a sophomore in high school. Up until that year, Rachel had always excelled at school, but sophomore year, her grades started falling. She was turning in work late, or in some cases not turning it in at all. It wasn't like her. In additional, Rachel just wasn't her normal peppy self. She was quiet, more withdrawn. When we asked her what was going on, we'd just get vague answers. It was clear Rachel was unhappy, but we didn't understand why. For those that have never dealt with a relative with depression, it's scary. You can see someone you love suffering, but it's not obvious how to help them. We got Rachel a therapist, and we tried our best to understand what exactly was causing her to be unhappy, but for months it just felt like she was spiraling downward.</p>

<p>Finally, Rachel suggested that maybe she should leave her school. As I explained in the story about the house, we had chosen to live in the city we do specifically because of the school system, but at that point, we were willing to entertain any idea. One of Rachel's qualities is when she gets interested in a topic, she dives deep. She started learning all about alternative education systems. The more she focused on learning about how else kids could learn, the more she seemed to stop withdrawing.</p>

<p>One day, she came to us and said she was interested in going to a school called Big Picture. It was part of a nationwide system of schools dedicated in teaching under a new paradigm. There were no grades. The learning was project based, using projects proposed by the student. There was an emphasis on internships and experience learning. And the school was 40 minutes away (and this was before Rachel had gotten her driver's license).</p>

<p>I'll admit, at first blush, it was a lot to swallow. I'd watched a lot of documentaries with Rachel on alternative learning, so I was beginning to understand the logic behind it, but as a parent, there were still concerns. If she started this program and didn't like it, it meant she'd have to redo the years as the lack of grades would keep the work from applying at other schools. We had no idea what colleges would accept a student without grades. And the school was far away in a school district that had a lot of financial challenges. But Rachel had stopped spiraling, and I guess we were willing to try anything if it helped her.</p>

<p>In order to get into the new school (and note it was the middle of her sophomore year), Rachel, Lora, and I had to come in for an interview with the two teachers that oversaw Rachel's age (the same pair of teachers oversees the class through all four years of high school). I was extremely skeptical as we were driving there that day, but when I watched the interview and saw what they were asking and how Rachel was answering, I knew it was the right place for her. They accepted her, and Rachel started the following week. (Longtime "Drive to Work" listeners might remember me driving Rachel to school for about a year.) Anyway, Rachel thrived, and I'm happy to say she just graduated summa cum laude (with a 3.97) from Columbia College Chicago. Which brings us to the next lesson:</p>

<p><strong>The right answer is not always apparent at first.</strong></p>

<p>Looking back, there were so many times when I was scared we were making the absolute wrong decision. The correct answer triggered so many red flags for me, but it was only through exploring ideas that scared me that we found the correct answer.</p>

<p>This lesson is an easy one to apply to <em>Magic</em> design. For example, I remember the first time Brian Tinsman pitched the exalted mechanic to me (<em>Whenever a creature you control attacks alone, that creature gets +1/+1 until end of turn.</em>) My initial impression was that it was too small a hoop to jump through to be a viable mechanic. I had no faith in it, but Brian was excited by it, so we tried playtesting it. After that playtest, I remember going up to Brian and saying, "I'm so sorry. This is a really good mechanic." And I never would have come to learn that if I hadn't tried playing with it.</p>

<p><em>Magic</em> design is constantly exploring new space, which means we're going to try out things that we have no experience with. Those designs might feel foreign or unnatural. They might fly in the face of things we've purposefully chosen not to do. Pitch cards broke the rule that you can't cast spells when you're tapped out. Split cards didn't look like normal cards. Hybrid mana didn't seem to have much purpose. Double-faced cards didn't have a back. There's always a reason to reject something because it doesn't fit how you imagined things should be, but you have to be open, in life and in <em>Magic</em> design, to the idea that the best path might not be instantly obvious.</p>

<h1>Keep on Learning</h1>

<p>That's my column for today. I'm sorry it's taken me so long to write a more personal column. If you'd like to see more of these (or rather not see them again), please let me know. As always, I'm eager for any feedback, be it through <a href="mailto:making.magic@hotmail.com">email</a> or any of my social media accounts (<a href="https://twitter.com/maro254" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://markrosewater.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Tumblr</a>, <a href="http://instagram.com/mtgmaro" target="_blank">Instagram</a>, and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@markrosewater" target="_blank">TikTok</a>).</p>

<p>Join me next week when I go through the As and Zs of design.</p>

<p>Until then, may you find the lessons of your own life.</p>

<p><em>Alchemy Horizons: Baldur's Gate </em>is on the<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> uh, horizon! Preorder the new set beginning next Thursday, June 23.</p>

<p><em>Alchemy Horizons: Baldur's Gate</em> is <em>MTG Arena</em>'s way of bringing the tabletop set <em>Commander Legends: Battle for Baldur's Gate</em> to the digital space. The tabletop Commander set posed some natural challenges, so we brought over cards directly where we could, then had Donald Smith lead the design on 81 new cards. With some truly wild mechanics for more <em>Baldur's Gate </em>style, plus returning flavorful reprints from <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Adventures in the Forgotten Realms</em>, this set is both a major expansion for Alchemy and a great draft experience!</p>

<p>Below is a taste of a few cards you'll find in <em>Alchemy Horizons: Baldur's Gate</em>, including returning cards from <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Adventures in the Forgotten Realms</em>, rebalanced cards for Alchemy from <em>Commander Legends: Battle for Baldur's Gate</em> and <em>Adventures in the Forgotten Realms</em>, plus reimagined cards featuring a mechanic we're not showing off yet!</p>

<p>UPDATE: you can see more cards in <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/card-image-gallery/alchemy-horizons-baldurs-gate" target="_blank">the <em>Alchemy Horizons: Baldur's Gate</em> Card Image Gallery</a>, too!</p>

Packets Update for Alchemy Horizons: Baldur's Gate</title><link>https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/mtg-arena/jump-in-packets-update-for-alchemy-horizons-baldurs-gate</link><guid>https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/mtg-arena/jump-in-packets-update-for-alchemy-horizons-baldurs-gate</guid><description><![CDATA[<p><em>Alchemy Horizons: Baldur's Gate</em> arrives in <em>MTG Arena </em>on July 7, 2022, and with it comes a fresh update to <em>Jump In!</em> packets, plus nonbasic lands from <em>Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty</em>!</p>

<p>In <em>Jump In!</em>, you pick from themed packets to build a ready-to-play deck. There are hundreds of potential combinations, and each packet has some built-in variance, so you never know what to expect next!</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Splash image with a werewolf and Jaxis, the Troublemaker" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/kq6ke4cevj4.jpg" /></p>

<h1><em>Jump In! </em>Event Details</h1>

<p><strong>Starts</strong>: Thursday, July 7, 2022, 8 a.m. PT (15:00 UTC)</p>

<p><strong>Entry</strong>: 1,000 gold or 200 gems</p>

<p><strong>Format</strong>: <em>Jump In!</em>—pick two packets and play a combined deck with added basic lands.</p>

<p><strong>Structure</strong>: Play as many games as you wish, resign when you're done. You may pay the entry and rejoin to select new packets and play again.</p>

<p><strong>Rewards</strong>: First win awards an uncommon individual card reward (ICR), with a 5% upgrade possibility to rare or mythic rare.</p>

<h1><em>Jump In!</em> Lands</h1>

<p>When you play in <em>Jump In!</em> events, you automatically receive a mix of basic lands based on the packets you choose, balanced for the costs and activated abilities on the spells in your packets.</p>

<p>You'll also receive nonbasic lands for play! Packets you choose will add dual lands from <em>Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty</em> in the colors appropriate to your deck.</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><auto-card>Bloodfell Caves</auto-card> <auto-card>Blossoming Sands</auto-card> <auto-card>Dismal Backwater</auto-card></p>

<p>If you haven't acquired these lands before, they'll be added to your collection, and these nonbasic lands are factored in before basic lands are determined for your deck.</p>

<h1>How Packet Selection Works</h1>

<p><em>Jump In! </em>will present you with three options for your first packet. At least one option will be a packet you've never selected in a previous run of the event (unless you've selected them all). There will always be at least one monocolor option and one multicolor option, and no options will have exactly the same color identity as another.</p>

<p>You will also be presented three options for your second packet. The options for the second packet are based on the colors of your first packet selection:</p>

<ul>
    <li>If your first packet selection has one color, there will always be at least one monocolor option and at least one multicolor option. All multicolor options will contain the color of the first packet selection.</li>
    <li>If your first packet selection has two colors, there will always be at least two monocolor options, and at least one of each color. No monocolor option will be outside of the first packet selection's colors. If there is a multicolor option, either its colors will be the same as the first packet selected or it will contain both of those colors plus an additional color.</li>
    <li>If your first packet selection has three colors, there will always be at least two monocolor options, covering at least two of those colors. No monocolor option will be outside of the first packet selection's colors. If there is a multicolor option, it will only contain colors within the first packet selection's color.</li>
</ul>

<p>By now you've seen the cards, learned about the mechanics, and even had a chance to see the card set in action during our early access event. And this Thursday, <em>Alchemy Horizons: Baldur's Gate</em> (expansion code: HBG) will be here to do what Alchemy does best: introduce new cards, unleash new mechanics, and shake things up with rebalanced versions of existing for a dynamic play experience you can only find on <em>MTG Arena</em>.</p>

<p>In addition to these guiding principles that have defined Alchemy since its inception, <em>Alchemy Horizons: Baldur's Gate</em> provided us with a unique design challenge: taking a set designed for a tabletop, multiplayer, eternal format and transforming it into a fun, fast, digital experience designed for one-on-one games in both Standard and Historic. This was an incredibly large undertaking, but we knew it'd be worth it because in addition to our love of Baldur's Gate and all things D&amp;D, there's something else we (and our players) love: Historic Brawl.</p>

<p>Historic Brawl was a major driving force for wanting to keep as much of the "Commander" roots in the set as possible, and why we tried to include as many cards pulled from <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/products/commander-legends-battle-baldurs-gate" target="_blank"><em>Commander Legends: Battle for Baldur's Gate</em></a> as possible. There are a few "release day rebalances" to a small number of cards to ensure they're better suited for one-on-on digital play, but these adjustments were relatively minor, and most of the cards from <em>Commander Legends: Battle for Baldur's Gate should be mostly the same. </em></p>

<p>Of course, this wouldn't be much of an Alchemy set if it didn't also include all-new cards designed specifically for digital play. These cards will be easily identifiable by the Alchemy "A" symbol on the bottom center of the card, like the holo-stamp that appears on tabletop cards, as well as their use of digital-only mechanics, including new mechanics that bring the flavor of <em>Commander Legends: Battle for Baldur's Gate</em> to <em>MTG Arena</em>: boon, double team, and specialize.</p>

<p>While <a href="https://admin.magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/mtg-arena-announcements-june-22-2022" target="_blank">we've previously covered how these mechanics work</a>, we did want to spend a little more time today talking about specialize. Specialize is our take on the background mechanic; so yes, you can use cards with specialize as your Commander in Brawl. If you pick a card with specialize as your commander, you must pick a color specialization, even if you choose to keep the card monocolored. You will be prompted via a color wheel in the deck builder to select their specialized color identity, which will then filter your collection to adhere to Brawl color identity rules. If you dismiss the prompt without picking a color specialization, the card will be removed from the Commander slot. If you're unsure of what each specialization option entails, you can right-click (or tap and hold) on any specialize card in your collection and select the "See Specialization options."</p>

<p>Last, but not least, to give <em>Alchemy Horzions: Battle for Baldur's Gate</em> the full set experience, we included cards from last year's <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Adventures in the Forgotten Realms</em> to round out our Draft and Sealed experiences.</p>

<p>It's a good thing this set includes a [autocard]Bag of Holding[/autocard], because it comes with <em>a lot</em>. Whether you're looking to start a Brawl, show off your <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/alchemy-horizons-baldurs-gate-mastery-details-2022-06-28" target="_blank">Set Mastery</a>, or Draft a d20 deck, <em>Alchemy Horizons: Baldur's Gate</em> has something for you—and to think, there's still more to come to keep things fun and exciting until the release of <em><a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/products/dominaria-united" target="_blank">Dominaria United</a></em>.</p>

<h1>The Rising Tide of <em>MTG Arena</em></h1>

<p>When <em>MTG Arena</em> first came online, it supported only one main Constructed format: Standard. Fast forward a few years, and we still had only two: Standard and Historic. But in the past year, we've doubled the number of our main Constructed formats: Standard, Historic, Alchemy, and Explorer.</p>

<p>As <em>Magic</em> players ourselves, it feels great to expand our offerings, including unique <em>Magic</em> experiences that only exist on <em>MTG Arena</em>, and bring a different and valuable layer of depth to the game. Indeed, one of <em>Magic</em>'s greatest strengths is that there are many ways to play with many kinds of players. Whether you are a veteran or fresh face, whether you started on tabletop or online, and whatever your favorite format, we are glad to have you as a part of <em>Magic</em>!</p>

<p>Of course, this growth also brings new needs! All our designated main formats are important, and we want to assure players there will be content coming to <em>MTG Arena</em> for each of them. Here are some of the things you'll be seeing later this year:</p>

<ul>
	<li>First and foremost, <em>Alchemy Horizons: Baldur's Gate</em> itself will be bringing new cards and rebalances (see below) to Alchemy and Historic later this week!</li>
	<li>Later this summer, we will be releasing <em>two</em> new Anthologies:
	<ul>
		<li>Explorer Anthology 1 will contain 20 Explorer-legal cards, from iconic powerhouses to offbeat favorites.</li>
		<li>Historic Anthology 6 will contain 20 cards legal only in Historic, bringing new possibilities to our broadest and most powerful format.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>For Standard players who want to fortify their collections before rotation, we will be running several weeks of extra Premier Drafts for this past year's sets, starting with <em>Innistrad: Midnight Hunt</em>.</li>
	<li><em>Dominaria United</em> will bring new content to all our formats in the fall, followed by <em>The Brothers' War</em> toward the end of the year.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of those sets will continue to receive supplemental Alchemy card releases in the weeks following their release.</p>

<p>Although no single card set or anthology will ever be able to support every single mode in <em>Magic</em>, we want to ensure players have new and exciting content to enjoy in all our supported formats. Let us know what you're most looking forward to!</p>

<h1>Rebalancing Act</h1>

<p>With the release of <em>Alchemy Horizons: Baldur's Gate</em>, we will also be enacting <a href="http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/alchemy-rebalancing-july-07-2022" target="_blank">a new batch of card rebalances in Alchemy and Historic</a>.</p>

<p>The first set of changes target some powerful cards from popular Historic archetypes. Izzet spell-based decks (usually featuring [autocard]Arclight Phoenix[/autocard]) and sacrifice-based Food decks have both been pillars of the Historic metagame for a long time, often to the point of crowding out other options with their power and resilience. While we respect that stability can be a virtue in non-rotating formats, it can also lead to staleness, and Historic has greater flexibility than a tabletop-faithful format like Explorer.</p>

<p>To be clear, <strong>the goal of these changes is not to eliminate these archetypes altogether</strong> but to create space for new strategies to challenge them. We hope that Historic will end up with some new faces in the mix alongside existing ones and a broader range of options overall.</p>

<p>The second set of changes is giving a broad boost to a few archetypes that haven't fully flourished in Alchemy. Spell-based decks and +1/+1 counter decks haven't found great success there yet, but these changes will give them a chance at a revival in the final months before some of the key support and build-around cards rotate out.</p>

<p><a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/july-5-2022-banned-and-restricted-announcement-2022-07-05" target="_blank">We are also banning one card in Alchemy</a>: [autocard]Grinning Ignus[/autocard]. Grinning Ignus has recently surged as the centerpiece of a powerful combo deck. Although we considered rebalancing Ignus or a related card to remove the combo, our attempts would have either effectively removed it from the format entirely or turned it into a completely different card. In situations like this, a ban is still the most appropriate action.</p>

<p>Historic has much more robust tools to disrupt or outrace this combo, so it will remain playable in that format. We will continue to monitor its behavior and play rate and will take additional action if necessary.</p>

<p>For full details and more background behind these changes, check out Tuesday's <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/july-5-2022-banned-and-restricted-announcement-2022-07-05" target="_blank">Banned and Restricted article</a>.</p>

<h1>Renewal Revs Up</h1>

<p>The release of <em>Alchemy Horizons: Baldur's Gate</em> also beings our first steps towards Standard rotation this fall. If any of those words sound strange to you, you can check out <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/mtg-arena-renewal-rotation">our full guide to Renewal and rotation</a>, but for those of you who just need a refresher, here's everything that's coming with this release:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Updated New Player Decks</strong>: These decks will feature only cards from <em>Innistrad: Midnight Hunt</em> and forward, so they will remain legal in both Alchemy and Standard after rotation. Players who collected previous new player decks will receive any cards from the new decks that they haven't already collected as an automatic grant</li>
	<li><strong><a href="http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/jump-packets-update-alchemy-horizons-baldurs-gate-2022-07-06" target="_blank">New <em>Jump In!</em> Packets</a>:</strong> Packets using themes from the rotating sets will be retired, while remaining packets will be revised to contain only cards that won't be rotating out. This is in addition to the usual addition of new packets that will feature content from <em>Alchemy Horizons: Baldur's Gate</em>.</li>
	<li><strong>Updated Individual Card Rewards (ICRs): </strong>Players will now only receive ICRs from sets that will still be legal in Standard and Alchemy after rotation (i.e., <em>Innistrad: Midnight Hunt</em> forward).</li>
	<li><strong>Quick Draft:</strong> For the time being, Quick Draft events will only be made up of sets from <em>Innistrad: Midnight Hunt</em> forward to ensure players will be playing and collecting cards that can be used in Alchemy or Standard post-rotation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now that rotation is only a few months away, we want to ensure that any rewards you earn will be yours to play with for many more months to come. Information on additional Renewal rewards will be available in August.</p>

As such, starting with <em>Dominaria</em> <em>United</em>, we will no longer publish tabletop <em>Magic</em> in Russian, Korean, or Chinese (Traditional).</p>

<p>While we do not plan to publish tabletop <em>Magic</em> in these languages, we will continue to fully support Wizards Play Network stores with WPN events and promos, though promos and other products will be in English. Additionally, <em>Magic: The Gathering Arena</em> will continue to support Korean and Russian.</p>

<p>The core languages include English, Japanese, Chinese (Simplified), French, Italian, German, Spanish, and Portuguese. While not all products are available in all languages, our premier sets and other ancillary releases will focus on these eight languages.</p>

<p>Historic and Explorer formats are getting new bundles of awesome cards with the release of Historic Anthology 6 and Explorer Anthology 1!</p>

<p>Available July 28 until October 5 for 4,000 gems or 25,000 gold, each bundle contains four copies of 20 powerful, iconic, and popular cards that open up new deck-building options.</p>

<p>For a taste of what you'll find in each, check out these teaser cards!</p>

<h2>Historic Anthology 6</h2>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Go-Shintai of Life's Origin" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/6jd29wh5qs5.png" /><img alt="Tarmogoyf" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/cdvg6vw7uq7.png" /><img alt="Avacyn, Angel of Hope" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/trdztcmh67y.png" /></p>

<p>As this is our first Historic Anthology drop since the arrival of Alchemy, we want to affirm what <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/alchemy-rebalancing-philosophy-2021-12-02" target="_blank">we stated back in December</a>: we will not be rebalancing iconic cards that have a significant history behind them. If these cards cause issues, we will look to address them <em><strong>indirectly</strong></em> through live balancing or ban them if necessary.</p>

<h2>Explorer Anthology 1</h2>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Favored Hoplite" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/8w2rgtrnrw3.png" /><img alt="Supreme Verdict" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/8vmazczhueh.png" /><img alt="Kalitas, Traitor of Ghet" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/t2e2k33scqe.png" /></p>

<p>More cards will be revealed over the coming week, so <a href="#social">tune into our social channels</a> for those. Then look for the full card lists coming Wednesday, July 27!</p>

<h1>This Weekend: Final July Qualifier Play-In and Qualifier Weekend</h1>

<p>This weekend is packed with Premier Play events! Starting Friday, July 22, the <a href="https://magic.gg/events/qualifier-play-in" target="_blank">Qualifier Play-In event</a> is your last chance to compete for an invitation to the July Qualifier Weekend. The format is <em>Alchemy Horizons: Baldur's Gate </em>Phantom Sealed in Best-of-Three matches.</p>

<p>Then, it's the main event: the <a href="https://magic.gg/events/qualifier-weekend" target="_blank">July Qualifier Weekend</a>! Kicking off on Saturday, July 23, and continuing until Sunday, July 24, this is where the best face off to determine who gets an invitation to the pinnacle of <em>MTG Arena</em> competitive play, the <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/mtg-arena-premier-play-2022-04-21" target="_blank">Arena Championship</a>!</p>

<p>The entry window for both Qualifier Weekend days' events is 6 a.m. PT (13:00 UTC) until 8 a.m. PT (15:00 UTC) when signup locks—so don't be late! The format for both days is <em>Alchemy Horizons: Baldur's Gate </em>Phantom Sealed in Best-of-Three matches.</p>

<h1><a id="arenaopen" name="arenaopen"></a>Arena Open with a Twist</h1>

<p><a href="http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/july-2022-arena-open-alchemy-horizons-baldurs-gate-limited-2022-07-20" target="_blank">This month's Arena Open, happening July 30–31</a>, comes with a new twist. In past Limited Arena Opens, players who made it to Day 2 would draft a single deck, and then play up to nine full matches with it. Although Day 2 is expected to be an intense competition, this many games with a single draft deck made the experience more of a repetitive grind.</p>

<p>To give Day 2 players more potential variety throughout the day, we are changing the structure of this month's Arena Open Day 2.</p>

<ul>
	<li>As before, all Day 2 players will draft at the beginning of the day. <strong>The entry period for Draft One is the usual&nbsp;6 a.m. to 8 a.m. PT (13:00–15:00 UTC)</strong>. Players will then have until 12 p.m. PT (19:00 UTC) to earn up to three match wins with that deck or be eliminated after a match loss.</li>
	<li>Then, all surviving players will draft a second time. The entry period for Draft Two is from&nbsp;<strong>12 p.m. to 2 p.m. PT (19:00–21:00 UTC)</strong>. Players will have until 6 p.m. PT (01:00 UTC, August 1) to earn up to three more match wins or be eliminated after a match loss.<br />
	<strong>Earning&nbsp;even a single win&nbsp;in Draft Two will be enough for a cash prize</strong><strong> and an invitation to the </strong><a href="https://magic.gg/events/qualifier-weekend" target="_blank"><strong>August 20–21 Qualifier Weekend</strong></a><strong>!</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The full prize structure for Day 2 is now:</p>

<p>Effectively, instead of playing to eight match wins or two match losses, players will now play to six match wins or one match loss, with a new draft after the first three rounds.</p>

<p>This new structure puts extra emphasis on drafting ability, since a single deck will not be able to carry you through the entire day, and it gives players some variety in their decks throughout the day. It also shortens the path to the cash prizes, although with less room for missteps.</p>

<p>We hope that this makes for a more robust competition experience, and we look forward to hearing how it works out for players.</p>

<h2>Day 2</h2>
<p>Players who qualify during Day 1 events may enter Day 2 competition with a new structure and rewards. You may only
    enter once on Day 2, even if you qualify multiple times on Day 1.</p>
<p>There will be two Best-of-Three <em>Arena Cube</em> drafts using 30-minute match timers for each player.</p>

<p>Draft One features four guaranteed matches. Achieving a record of 3–1 or 4–0 will earn you a Draft Two entry token.
    Players with an undefeated 4–0 record from Draft One will carry forward an unused loss pip to Draft Two. That means
    Draft Two for those players will be a double elimination, allowing them to suffer one loss and stay in the running.
</p>
<p>In Draft Two, players compete until they earn four wins or reach:</p>
<ul>
    <li>One loss for those with a 3–1 record from Draft One</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Two losses for those with an undefeated 4–0 record from Draft One</li>
</ul>
<p>All Draft Two players will draft and matchmake in the same queues.</p>
<p>All Day 2 players will draft at the beginning of the day for Draft One. <strong>The entry period for Draft One is
        from 6 a.m. to 8 a.m. PT (14:00–16:00 UTC)</strong>. Players will then have until 12 p.m. PT (20:00 UTC) to
    complete four matches. Earning three or four match wins will grant an entry token to the Draft Two event. Players
    with four wins will carry forward an extra loss pip, making their Draft Two a double-elimination event (players with
    three wins in Draft One will have a single-elimination Draft Two event).</p>
<p>Then, all continuing players will draft a second time in Draft Two. <strong>The entry period for Draft Two is from 12
        p.m. to 2 p.m. PT (20:00–22:00 UTC)</strong>. Players will have until 6 p.m. PT (November 28, 02:00 UTC) to earn
    up to four match wins or be eliminated after either one match loss or two match losses for those players whose
    undefeated Draft One record allowed them to carry forward the extra loss pip as described above.</p>

<p>The Release Notes include information concerning the release of a new <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> set, as well as a collection of clarifications and rulings involving that set's cards. It's intended to make playing with the new cards more fun by clearing up the common misconceptions and confusion inevitably caused by new mechanics and interactions. As future sets are released, updates to the <em>Magic</em> rules may cause some of this information to become outdated. Go to <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/rules" target="_blank">Magic.Wizards.com/Rules</a> to find the most up-to-date rules.</p>

<p>The "General Notes" sections include information about card legality and explain some of the mechanics and concepts in the set.</p>

<p>The "Card-Specific Notes" sections contain answers to the most important, most common, and most confusing questions players might ask about cards in the set. Items in the "Card-Specific Notes" sections include full card text for your reference. Not all cards in the set are listed.</p>

<h3>New Mechanic: Prototype Cards</h3>

<p><em>The Brothers' War </em>features prototype cards, which have a mechanic that represents an artificer's work in different stages of development. Each prototype card is an artifact creature which has a secondary set of mana cost, power, and toughness characteristics that are inset in the top of its text box. (When the complete rules text is displayed as text, the inset text appears after the card's other rules text, following the "//" characters.) It can be cast using either its normal characteristics or it can be cast as a smaller "prototyped" version of itself that uses the secondary characteristics instead.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img alt="Blitz Automaton" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/bro/en_Bavo4LRTbq.png" /></p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;">Blitz Automaton<br />
{7}<br />
Artifact Creature — Construct<br />
6/4<br />
Haste<br />
//<br />
{2}{R}<br />
Prototype <em>(You may cast this spell with different mana cost, color, and size. It keeps its abilities and types.)</em><br />
3/2</p>

<p>You can cast Blitz Automaton normally by paying {7}. In that case, it remains a colorless 6/4 Construct artifact creature with haste, and its mana value is 7. What if you don't have seven mana yet? Well, you can cast a prototyped Blitz Automaton instead by paying its {2}{R} mana cost. If you do, it becomes a red 3/2 Construct artifact creature with haste, and its mana value is 3. The different characteristics apply both to the creature spell on the stack and the permanent on the battlefield.</p>

<p>Other Prototype Notes:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A prototype card is a colorless card in every zone except the stack or the battlefield, as well as while on the stack or the battlefield if not cast as a prototyped spell. Ignore its alternative characteristics in those cases. For example, while it's in your graveyard, Blitz Automaton is a colorless creature card with mana value 7. It can't be the target of Recommission, a spell that targets an artifact or creature card with mana value 3 or less in your graveyard.</li>
	<li>When cast as a prototyped spell, that spell has the mana cost, power, and toughness characteristics shown in its colored, secondary text box rather than the normal values of those characteristics. Its color and mana value are determined by that mana cost. The permanent that spell becomes as it resolves has the same characteristics. If the spell leaves the stack in any other way, or the permanent it becomes leaves the battlefield, it immediately resumes using its normal characteristics.</li>
	<li>Regardless of how it was cast, a prototype card always has the same name, abilities, types, and so on. Only the mana cost, mana value, color, power, and toughness change depending on whether the card was cast as a prototyped spell.</li>
	<li>The prototype ability functions in any zone that the spell could be cast from. For example, if an effect allows you to cast artifact spells from your graveyard, you could cast a prototyped Blitz Automaton from your graveyard.</li>
	<li>Casting a prototyped spell isn't the same as casting it for an alternative cost, and an alternative cost may be applied to a spell cast this way. For example, if an effect allows you to cast an artifact card without paying its mana cost, you could either cast Blitz Automaton normally, or as a prototyped spell.</li>
	<li>When casting a prototyped spell, use only its prototype characteristics to determine whether it's legal to cast it. For example, if Blitz Automaton is exiled with the last ability of Chandra, Dressed to Kill, you would be able to cast it for {2}{R} (because it's a red spell), even though you wouldn't be able to cast it as a colorless spell for its normal cost.</li>
	<li>If an effect copies a prototyped spell, that copy (as well as the token it becomes on the battlefield) will have the same characteristics as the prototyped spell. Similarly, if an effect creates a token that's a copy of a prototyped permanent or causes another permanent to become a copy of it, the copy would have the same characteristics as the prototyped permanent.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Returning Mechanic: Meld Cards</h3>

<p><em>Magic</em> cards often combine together in powerful ways, but some cards <em>meld</em> together in a more literal manner, becoming a single permanent represented by two cards.</p>

<p>The two cards in the meld pair below are Argoth, Sanctum of Nature and Titania, Voice of Gaea. These cards behave like normal <em>Magic</em> cards most of the time, but if you own and control both halves of this meld pair on the battlefield when Titania, Voice of Gaea's last ability resolves, they'll combine into an oversized card: Titania, Gaea Incarnate. The top half of Titania, Gaea Incarnate is printed on the back of Titania, Voice of Gaea's card. The bottom half is printed on the back of Argoth, Sanctum of Nature's card.</p>

<ul>
	<li>When Titania, Voice of Gaea and Argoth, Sanctum of Nature are melded, the result is a single creature—Titania, Gaea Incarnate—that's represented by two cards. If the melded creature dies, both cards are put into your graveyard. As it leaves the battlefield, both of those cards are turned face up again. If the cards are put on the top or bottom of your library, you choose their relative order.</li>
	<li>One card in each pair of meld cards has an ability that instructs you to exile the two cards and meld them. If you control more than one object with one of those names, you select one object with that name to exile.</li>
	<li>When two cards are exiled and melded, they each leave the battlefield, then return together as one new object with no relation to either of the objects that left the battlefield. Counters, Auras, Equipment, and other effects that affected those two cards don't affect the melded permanent.</li>
	<li>Only two cards belonging to the same meld pair can be melded. Tokens, cards that aren't meld cards, or meld cards that don't form a meld pair can't be melded. If an effect instructs a player to meld cards that can't be melded, those cards remain in exile.</li>
	<li>While a meld card is in any zone other than the battlefield, it has only the characteristics of its front face. The same is true while it's on the battlefield with its front face up.</li>
	<li>While a melded permanent is on the battlefield, it has only the characteristics of its combined back face. Any effects that modify how the new object enters the battlefield will consider only the combined back face.</li>
	<li>Note that the permanent represented by the combined back faces has a color indicator.</li>
	<li>The mana value of a melded permanent is the sum of the mana values of its front faces. A creature that becomes a copy of a melded permanent has only the characteristics of that combined back face, and its mana value is 0.</li>
	<li>A player prompted to name a card may name the combined back face, and each player has the right to know that combined back face's characteristics at all times.</li>
	<li>If an effect moves a melded permanent to a new zone and then affects "that card," it affects both cards.</li>
	<li>In the Commander variant, a meld card's color identity is determined only by the mana costs and mana symbols in the rules text of its front face. No symbols or rules text of the permanent it melds into are considered.</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<h3>Returning Mechanic: Unearth</h3>

<p>Casting powerful spells is great, but sometimes excavating the past can be just as useful. Unearth is a returning mechanic that lets some permanent cards return to the battlefield one last time. Previously, unearth has appeared mostly on creature cards, but <em>The Brothers' War </em>features the mechanic on some artifact cards too.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img alt="Ashnod's Harvester" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/bro/en_HVpCWMJxfc.png" /></p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;">Ashnod's Harvester<br />

Whenever Ashnod's Harvester attacks, exile target card from a graveyard.<br />
Unearth {1}{B} <em>({1}{B}: Return this card from your graveyard to the battlefield. It gains haste. Exile it at the beginning of the next end step or if it would leave the battlefield. Unearth only as a sorcery.)</em></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img alt="Mishra's Research Desk" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/bro/en_MLrtlWQFeG.png" /></p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;">Mishra's Research Desk<br />
{1}<br />
Artifact<br />
{1}, {T}, Sacrifice Mishra's Research Desk: Exile the top two cards of your library. Choose one of them. Until the end of your next turn, you may play that card.<br />
Unearth {1}{R} <em>({1}{R}: Return this card from your graveyard to the battlefield. Exile it at the beginning of the next end step or if it would leave the battlefield. Unearth only as a sorcery.)</em></p>

<ul>
	<li>If you activate a card's unearth ability but that card is removed from your graveyard before the ability resolves, that unearth ability will do nothing as it resolves.</li>
	<li>Activating a card's unearth ability isn't the same as casting that card. The unearth ability is put on the stack, but the card is not. Spells and abilities that interact with activated abilities (such as Defabricate's second mode) will interact with unearth, but spells and abilities that interact with spells (such as Scatter Ray) will not.</li>
	<li>At the beginning of the next end step, a permanent returned to the battlefield with unearth is exiled. This is a delayed triggered ability, and it can be countered by effects such as Defabricate that counter triggered abilities. If the ability is countered, the permanent will stay on the battlefield and the delayed triggered ability won't trigger again. However, the replacement effect will still exile the permanent if it eventually leaves the battlefield.</li>
	<li>Unearth grants haste to the permanent that's returned to the battlefield (even if it's not a creature card). However, neither of the "exile" abilities is granted to that permanent. If that permanent loses all its abilities, it will still be exiled at the beginning of the next end step, and if it would leave the battlefield, it is still exiled instead.</li>
	<li>If a permanent returned to the battlefield with unearth would leave the battlefield for any reason, it's exiled instead—unless the spell or ability that's causing the permanent to leave the battlefield is actually trying to exile it! In that case, it succeeds at exiling it. If that spell or ability later returns the card to the battlefield (as Static Net might, for example), the permanent card will return to the battlefield as a new object with no relation to its previous existence. The unearth effects will no longer apply to it.</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<h3>Returning Mechanic: Powerstone Tokens</h3>

<p>First appearing on a few cards in <em>Dominaria United</em>, Powerstone tokens are predefined tokens that are returning with greater frequency in <em>The Brothers' War</em>. They can be tapped for colorless mana that can be spent on anything except casting a nonartifact spell.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img alt="Fallaji Excavation" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/bro/en_9LSB8yQWpI.png" /></p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;">Fallaji Excavation<br />
{3}{G}{G}<br />
Sorcery<br />
Create three tapped Powerstone tokens. You gain 3 life. <em>(The tokens are artifacts with "{T}: Add {C}. This mana can't be spent to cast a nonartifact spell.")</em></p>

<ul>
	<li>Powerstone tokens are a kind of predefined token. Each one has the artifact subtype "Powerstone" and the ability "{T}: Add {C}. This mana can't be spent to cast a nonartifact spell."</li>
	<li>You can use the {C} added by a Powerstone token on anything that isn't a nonartifact spell. This includes paying costs to activate abilities of both artifact and nonartifact permanents, paying ward costs, and so on.</li>
	<li>Although all the cards in <em>The Brothers' War</em> that create Powerstone tokens create a <em>tapped</em> Powerstone token, entering the battlefield tapped isn't part of the token's definition. Notably, if you create a token that is a copy of a Powerstone token, the token copy won't enter the battlefield tapped.</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<h3>Returning Mechanic: Stun Counters</h3>

<p>Stun counters were introduced in the <em>Dominaria United </em>release. They're a special kind of counter that stops tapped permanents from untapping.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img alt="Involuntary Cooldown" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/bro/en_ftyyayB0ok.png" /></p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;">Involuntary Cooldown<br />
{3}{U}<br />
Sorcery<br />
Tap up to two target artifacts and/or creatures. Put two stun counters on each of them. <em>(If a permanent with a stun counter would become untapped, remove one from it instead.)</em></p>

<ul>
	<li>If a tapped permanent with a stun counter on it would become untapped, a stun counter will be removed from it instead. This is a replacement effect.</li>
	<li>Stun counters replace untapping for any reason, including players untapping tapped permanents during their untap steps.</li>
	<li>If a permanent has more than one stun counter on it, only one will be removed each time it would become untapped.</li>
	<li>Abilities that trigger when a permanent "becomes untapped" won't trigger if a stun counter is removed instead.</li>
	<li>If untapping a permanent is part of a cost (such as that of Halo Fountain's first ability), you may pay that cost by "untapping" a tapped permanent with a stun counter on it. The stun counter will be removed and the creature will remain tapped. However, the cost will still be paid.</li>
	<li>On the other hand, if untapping multiple permanents is part of a cost (such as that of Halo Fountain's last two abilities), you can't "untap" the same permanent more than once to pay that cost.</li>
	<li>Stun counters exist independently of the effects that created them. If a permanent has no stun counters on it, it will untap as normal.</li>
	<li>Stun counters are not keyword counters, and they don't cause the permanents they're on to gain any abilities. They won't be affected by effects that cause permanents to lose all abilities.</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<h3>New Keyword Action: Convert</h3>

<h3>New Keyword Ability: More Than Meets the Eye</h3>

<h3>New Keyword Ability: Living Metal</h3>

<p><em>Universes Beyond Transformers Cards</em> introduce some new mechanics that are found only on these cards. Each Transformers double-faced card is a Robot artifact creature on its front face and a noncreature artifact (usually a Vehicle) on its back face, and it changes form on the battlefield whenever an ability instructs you to convert it. Each one can also be cast converted by paying the More Than Meets the Eye cost on its front face. Finally, each of the faces that are Vehicles have <em>living metal</em>, an ability that makes it a creature during its controller's turn.</p>

Whenever you cast a spell that targets one or more creatures or Vehicles you control, put that many +1/+1 counters on Arcee. Convert Arcee.</p>

<p>Convert notes:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The convert keyword action functions the same way as the transform keyword action found on some other cards; to convert a permanent on the battlefield, turn it over so that its other face is up.</li>
	<li>The mana value of a converted permanent on the battlefield is equal to the mana value of the card's front face, no matter which face is up.</li>
	<li>Converting a permanent doesn't affect any Auras or Equipment that are attached to it. Similarly, any counters on the permanent will remain on that permanent after it converts. Any continuous effects from a resolved spell or ability will continue to affect it. Any spells or abilities on the stack that target a permanent continue to do so after that permanent converts.</li>
	<li>Any triggered ability of another card that triggers whenever a permanent transforms will also trigger whenever a permanent converts.</li>
	<li>Similarly, an ability of another card that instructs you to "transform" one of these cards will cause you to convert it, even if that ability doesn't use the word "convert."</li>
</ul>

<p>More Than Meets the Eye notes:</p>

<ul>
	<li>"More Than Meets the Eye [cost]" means "You may cast this card converted by paying [cost] rather than its mana cost." It functions in any zone from which the spell can be cast.</li>
	<li>The cost is an alternative cost, so it can't be combined with any other alternative costs. It can be combined with any applicable additional costs.</li>
	<li>When you cast a spell using its More Than Meets the Eye ability, the card is put onto the stack with its back face up. The resulting spell has all characteristics of that face.</li>
	<li>To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost (such as a More Than Meets the Eye cost) you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions. The mana value of a spell cast using More Than Meets the Eye is determined by the mana cost on the front face of the card, no matter what the total cost to cast the spell was.</li>
	<li>A spell cast this way enters the battlefield with its back face up.</li>
	<li>If you copy a permanent spell cast this way, the copy has the characteristics of the card's back face, even though it isn't itself a double-faced card.</li>
</ul>

<p>Living metal notes:</p>

It doesn't copy whether that permanent is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras attached to it, or any noncopy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, and so on.</li>
	<li>Use the appropriate printed power and toughness (either 7/7 or 3/3) to determine the result of Hulking Metamorph's copy effect.</li>
	<li>If the chosen permanent has {X} in its mana cost, X is 0.</li>
	<li>If the chosen permanent is copying something else (for example, if the chosen permanent is a Clone), then your Hulking Metamorph enters the battlefield as whatever the chosen permanent copied, with the stated exceptions.</li>
	<li>If the chosen permanent is a token, Hulking Metamorph copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that put the token onto the battlefield, with the listed exceptions. Hulking Metamorph does not become a token.</li>
	<li>Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied permanent will trigger when Hulking Metamorph enters the battlefield. Any "as [this] enters the battlefield" or "[this] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the chosen permanent will also work.</li>
	<li>If Hulking Metamorph somehow enters the battlefield at the same time as another permanent, Hulking Metamorph can't become a copy of that permanent. You may choose only a permanent that's already on the battlefield.</li>
	<li>You can choose not to copy anything. In that case, Hulking Metamorph simply enters the battlefield as a 7/7 (or 3/3) artifact creature.</li>

At the beginning of your end step, if you've cast a noncreature spell this turn, reveal the top five cards of your library. For each card type among noncreature spells you've cast this turn, you may put a card of that type from among the revealed cards into your hand. Put the rest on the bottom of your library in a random order.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Hurkyl need not have been on the battlefield at the time the noncreature spells were cast for the ability to trigger or for the spells to be counted.</li>
	<li>The card types that a noncreature spell can have are artifact, enchantment, instant, planeswalker, sorcery, and tribal. Subtypes, like Human and Equipment, and supertypes, like snow and legendary, aren't card types.</li>

Enchantment<br />
Creatures you control get +1/+1.<br />
{5}{W}: Exile target nonland permanent you don't control until In the Trenches leaves the battlefield. Activate only as a sorcery and only once.</p>

<ul>
	<li>The activated ability is a single ability that creates two one-shot effects: one that exiles the permanent when the ability resolves, and another that returns the exiled card to the battlefield immediately after In the Trenches leaves the battlefield.</li>
	<li>If In the Trenches leaves the battlefield before its activated ability resolves, the target permanent won't be exiled.</li>
	<li>Auras attached to the exiled permanent will be put into their owners' graveyards. Equipment attached to an exiled creature will become unattached and remain on the battlefield. Any counters on the exiled permanent will cease to exist.</li>
	<li>If a token is exiled, it ceases to exist. It won't be returned to the battlefield.</li>
	<li>In a multiplayer game, if the owner of In the Trenches leaves the game, the exiled card will return to the battlefield. Because the one-shot effect that returns the card isn't an ability that goes on the stack, it won't cease to exist along with the leaving player's spells and abilities on the stack.</li>
	<li>The activated ability can only be activated once per game. If the ability is countered or otherwise fails to resolve after being activated, it can't be activated again.</li>
	<li>If In the Trenches leaves the battlefield and later returns to the battlefield, it is a new object on the battlefield with no memory of the last time it was there. Its ability may be activated, even if it was activated a previous time it was on the battlefield.</li>

Choose two —<br />
• Create a 2/2 colorless Construct artifact creature token.<br />
• Put a +1/+1 counter on a creature you control. It gains double strike until end of turn.<br />
• Search your library for a basic Plains card, reveal it, put it into your hand, then shuffle.<br />
• You gain 2 life and scry 2.</p>

<ul>
	<li>None of the modes have any targets. Notably, this means that you don't have to choose a creature for the second mode until the spell resolves.</li>

<ul>
	<li>The third ability applies only to casting spells. It does not, for example, change when you may activate abilities that can be activated "only as a sorcery."</li>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;">Mechanized Warfare<br />
{1}{R}{R}<br />
Enchantment<br />
If a red or artifact source you control would deal damage to an opponent or a permanent an opponent controls, it deals that much damage plus 1 instead.</p>

<ul>
	<li>The additional 1 damage is dealt by the original source of damage. The additional damage isn't dealt by Mechanized Warfare.</li>
	<li>If another effect modifies how much damage a source would deal to an opponent or a permanent they control, including preventing some of it, the player being dealt damage or the controller of the permanent being dealt damage chooses an order in which to apply those effects. If all of the damage is prevented, Mechanized Warfare's effect no longer applies.</li>
	<li>If damage dealt by a red or artifact source you control is being divided or assigned among multiple opponents and/or permanents opponents' control, divide the original amount before adding 1. For example, if you cast a red spell that deals 4 damage divided among any number of targets and you choose to have it deal 2 damage to a creature and 2 damage to that creature's controller, that spell will deal 3 damage to each of them instead.</li>

Enchant artifact<br />
When Mightstone's Animation enters the battlefield, draw a card.<br />
Enchanted artifact is a creature with base power and toughness 4/4 in addition to its other types.</p>

<ul>
	<li>The artifact retains any types, subtypes, or supertypes it has. Notably, an Equipment that becomes an artifact creature usually can't be attached to another creature. If it was attached to a creature, it becomes unattached.</li>
	<li>If the artifact was already a creature, its base power and toughness will each become 4. This overwrites any previous effects that set the creature's base power and toughness to specific values. Any power- or toughness-setting effects that start to apply after Mightstone's Animation becomes attached to the artifact will overwrite this effect.</li>
	<li>Effects that modify a creature's power and/or toughness, such as the ones created by Giant Growth, will apply to the creature no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for any counters that change its power and/or toughness and effects that switch power and toughness.</li>
	<li>The resulting artifact creature will be able to attack on your turn if it's been under your control continuously since the turn began. That is, it doesn't matter how long it's been a creature, just how long it's been on the battlefield.</li>

{2}, {T}, Exile The Stasis Coffin: You gain protection from everything until your next turn.</p>

<ul>
	<li>If a player has protection from everything, it means three things: (1) All damage that would be dealt to that player is prevented. (2) Auras can't be attached to that player. (3) That player can't be the target of spells or abilities.</li>
	<li>Nothing other than the specified events are prevented or illegal. An effect that doesn't target you could still cause you to discard cards, for example. Creatures can still attack you while you have protection from everything, although combat damage that they would deal to you will be prevented.</li>
	<li>If an effect says that damage can't be prevented, you can still take damage from untargeted sources, such as attacking creatures or spells that deal damage to each player.</li>
	<li>Gaining protection from everything causes a spell or ability on the stack to have an illegal target if it targets you. As a spell or ability tries to resolve, if all its targets are illegal, that spell or ability doesn't resolve and none of its effects happen, including effects unrelated to the target. If at least one target is still legal, the spell or ability does as much as it can to the remaining legal targets, and its other effects still happen.</li>

	<li>If Static Net leaves the battlefield before its first ability resolves, the target permanent won't be exiled.</li>

	<li>If a token is exiled, it ceases to exist. It won't be returned to the battlefield.</li>
	<li>In a multiplayer game, if Static Net's owner leaves the game, the exiled card will return to the battlefield.

When Disciple of Caelus Nin enters the battlefield, starting with you, each player chooses up to five permanents they control. All permanents other than Disciple of Caelus Nin that weren't chosen this way phase out.<br />
Permanents can't phase in.</p>

<ul>
	<li>The last ability means that no permanents phase in under any player's control as long as Disciple of Caelus Nin is on the battlefield. This includes permanents that phase out in ways other than the first ability, and even permanents that are phased out already when it enters the battlefield. Once it leaves the battlefield, each phased out permanent will phase in normally during its controller's untap step, with one exception (see below).</li>
	<li>If an effect causes a permanent to phase out "until" some event occurs, and that event occurs while Disciple of Caelus Nin is still on the battlefield, the phased out permanent stays phased out forever.</li>
	<li>If Disciple of Caelus Nin itself phases out, other phased out permanents can phase back in normally while it is phased out. During its controller's untap step, Caelus Nin and all other phased out permanents that player controls phase in at the same time.</li>
	<li>While a permanent is phased out, it's treated as though it doesn't exist. It can't be the target of spells or abilities, its static abilities have no effect on the game, its triggered abilities can't trigger, it can't attack or block, and so on.</li>
	<li>Phasing out doesn't cause any "leaves the battlefield" abilities to trigger. Similarly, phasing in won't cause any "enters the battlefield" abilities to trigger.</li>
	<li>Any one-shot effects that are waiting "until [this] leaves the battlefield," such as that of Banisher Priest, won't happen when a permanent phases out.</li>
	<li>Any continuous effects with a "for as long as" duration, such as that of Vodalian Mindsinger, ignore phased-out objects. Any such effects will expire if their conditions are no longer met after ignoring the phased-out objects.</li>
	<li>Each Aura and Equipment attached to a permanent that's phasing out also phases out. They will phase in with that permanent and still be attached to it. Similarly, permanents that phase out with counters phase in with those counters.</li>
	<li>Choices made for permanents as they entered the battlefield are remembered when they phase in.</li>

	<li>The token's name is Scrap, and it has no abilities.</li>
	<li>If, during a player's declare attackers step, a creature that player controls that's been goaded is tapped, is affected by a spell or ability that says it can't attack, or hasn't been under that player's control continuously since the turn began (and doesn't have haste), then it doesn't attack. If there's a cost associated with having a creature attack a player, its controller isn't forced to pay that cost, so it doesn't have to attack that player.</li>
	<li>If the creature doesn't meet any of the above exceptions and can attack, it must attack a player other than the controller of the spell or ability that goaded it if able. If the creature can't attack any of those players but could otherwise attack, it must attack an opposing planeswalker (controlled by any opponent) or the player that goaded it.</li>
	<li>Being goaded isn't an ability the creature has. Once it's been goaded, it must attack as detailed above even if it loses all abilities.</li>
	<li>Attacking with a goaded creature doesn't cause it to stop being goaded. If there is an additional combat phase that turn, or if another player gains control of it before it stops being goaded, it must attack again if able.</li>
	<li>If a creature you control has been goaded by multiple opponents, it must attack one of your opponents that hasn't goaded it, as that fulfills the maximum number of goad requirements. If a creature you control has been goaded by each of your opponents, you choose which opponent it attacks.</li>

	<li>Except for its types and non-artifact subtypes, Machine God's Effigy copies exactly what was printed on the original creature and nothing more (unless that creature is copying something else or is a token; see below), and it will have "{T}:Add {U}." It doesn't copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its types, color, and so on.</li>
	<li>Machine God's Effigy will not copy any types (such as creature or enchantment) or non-artifact subtypes (such as Phyrexian or Elf) that creature had, but it will copy any supertypes, such as legendary, and artifact subtypes (such as Treasure or Vehicle). It also has the same name, so if you copy a legendary creature you control, you will need to choose one of them to put in your graveyard due to the legend rule.</li>
	<li>If Machine God's Effigy copies a planeswalker that became a creature due to an effect, Machine God's Effigy will have that planeswalker's loyalty abilities but its only card type is artifact (it will still be legendary in most cases). Because it isn't a planeswalker itself, it won't enter the battlefield with any loyalty counters, but it also won't die because due to not having any. Similarly, it can't be attacked and damage can't be dealt to it. You may activate only one loyalty ability of that permanent per turn. If it later becomes a creature and damage is dealt to it, that damage won't remove any loyalty counters.</li>
	<li>If Machine God's Effigy copies a Saga that has become a creature due to an effect, it will have that Saga's chapter abilities, but it won't get a lore counter every turn because it isn't itself a Saga since its only card type is artifact. Unless it has the read ahead ability found on some Saga cards in the <em>Dominaria United </em>set, it also won't enter the battlefield with any counters. If you do find a way to put lore counters on it, the appropriate ability or abilities will trigger. It will not be sacrificed after it has lore counters equal to its final chapter number.</li>
	<li>If Machine God's Effigy copies a land with a basic land type that has become a creature due to an effect, it will not have any mana abilities that land had due to its land types (it will have the one it gives itself, though). For example, if a basic Forest became a creature due to some effect, and Machine God's Effigy entered the battlefield as a copy of it, it would be a basic artifact named Forest and have "{T}: Add {U}," but not the intrinsic ability "{T}: Add {G}."</li>
	<li>If the copied creature has {X} in its mana cost, X is 0.</li>
	<li>If the chosen creature is copying something else, then Machine God's Effigy enters the battlefield as whatever the chosen creature is copying (with the listed exceptions).</li>
	<li>If the chosen creature is a token, Machine God's Effigy copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that created the token, plus the listed exceptions. Machine God's Effigy is not a token, even when copying one.</li>
	<li>Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when Machine God's Effigy enters the battlefield. Any "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[this creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the chosen creature will also work. Note that some of these effects may function correctly only if it is a creature, and will not do anything productive since the copy is an artifact, not a creature.</li>
	<li>If Machine God's Effigy somehow enters the battlefield at the same time as another creature, it can't become a copy of that creature. You may choose only a creature that's already on the battlefield.</li>

	<li>If the copied artifact creature has {X} in its mana cost, X is 0.</li>
	<li>If the chosen artifact creature is copying something else, then the token enters the battlefield as whatever the chosen creature is copying.</li>
	<li>If the chosen artifact creature is itself a token, the token March of Progress creates copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that created that token.</li>
	<li>Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied artifact creature will trigger when the token enters the battlefield. Any "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[this creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the chosen creature will also work.</li>
	<li>If you don't pay the overload cost of a spell, that spell will have a single target. If you pay the overload cost, the spell won't have any targets.</li>
	<li>Because a spell with overload doesn't target when its overload cost is paid, it may affect permanents with hexproof or with protection from the appropriate color.</li>
	<li>Overload doesn't change when you can cast the spell.</li>
	<li>Casting a spell with overload doesn't change that spell's mana cost. You just pay the overload cost instead.</li>
	<li>Effects that cause you to pay more or less for a spell will cause you to pay that much more or less while casting it for its overload cost, too.</li>

Creature — Elf Druid<br />
3/4<br />
Lands you control and land cards in your library are basic.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Being basic doesn't grant any abilities to a land that it didn't already have, and doesn't remove any card types, subtypes, or supertypes. For example, a land card that is legendary will be both basic and legendary while on the battlefield or in your library.</li>
	<li>Notably, becoming basic also doesn't grant any of the basic land types. If an effect instructs you to search your library for a basic land while you control Rootpath Purifier, you may search for any land card in your library. However, if an effect instructs you to search your library for a card with a basic land type, you must search for a land that is a Plains, Island, Swamp, Mountain, or Forest, regardless of whether or not the land is basic.</li>
	<li>Lands that become basic are no longer nonbasic lands. This may change what effects can apply to them. For example, if an opponent controls Blood Moon, an enchantment which says "Nonbasic lands are Mountains," and you play Rootpath Purifier, Blood Moon can no longer apply to the lands you control because they are all basic.</li>

As long as an artifact creature you control is attacking, prevent all damage that would be dealt to Sanwell, Avenger Ace.<br />
Whenever Sanwell becomes tapped, exile the top six cards of your library. You may cast a Vehicle or artifact creature spell from among them. Then put the rest on the bottom of your library in a random order.</p>

<ul>
	<li>If Sanwell, Avenger Ace is somehow an artifact creature, its first ability will see itself while it is attacking.</li>
	<li>You must pay all costs for a spell cast using Sanwell's last ability.</li>
	<li>If you choose not to cast a spell this way, it goes to the bottom of the library with the other exiled cards. You can't wait and cast it later.</li>

<ul>
	<li>The token you create with the first ability copies the original characteristics of the token it's copying as stated by the effect that created that token. The newly created token doesn't copy whether the original token is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it, whether it has any Auras and/or Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that changed its power, toughness, types, color, and so on.</li>
	<li>If the original token is copying something else, the token you create will use the copiable values of the original token. In most cases, it will be a copy of whatever the original token is copying.</li>
	<li>For both abilities, if a token is created copying a token or card with {X} in its mana cost, X is 0.</li>

Each artifact creature card in your graveyard has encore.

<ul>
	<li>Exiling the card with encore is a cost to activate the ability. Once you announce that you're activating it, no player may take actions until you've finished. They can't try to remove the card from your graveyard to stop you from paying the cost.</li>
	<li>Opponents who have left the game aren't counted when determining how many tokens to create.</li>
	<li>The tokens copy only what's on the original card. Effects that modified that creature when it was previously on the battlefield won't be copied.</li>
	<li>Each token must attack the appropriate player if able.</li>
	<li>If one of the tokens can't attack for any reason (such as being tapped), then it doesn't attack. If there's a cost associated with having it attack, you aren't forced to pay that cost, so it doesn't have to attack in that case either.</li>
	<li>If an effect stops a token from attacking a specific player, that token can attack any player or planeswalker, or not attack at all. If the effect stops the token from attacking a specific player unless a cost is paid, you don't have to pay that cost unless you want to attack that player.</li>
	<li>If one of the tokens somehow is under another player's control as the delayed triggered ability resolves, you can't sacrifice that token. It remains on the battlefield indefinitely, even if you regain control of it later.</li>

<ul>
	<li>If you don't cast the copy (perhaps because there are no legal targets available or you don't want to), the copy will cease to exist.</li>
	<li>If you cast a spell "without paying its mana cost," you can't pay any alternative costs. You can, however, pay additional costs, such as kicker costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those.</li>
	<li>If the copy has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X.</li>
	<li>The card remains exiled no matter what happens to the copy.</li>

Whenever Megatron attacks, you may sacrifice another artifact. When you do, Megatron deals damage equal to the sacrificed artifact's mana value to target creature. If excess damage would be dealt to that creature this way, instead that damage is dealt to that creature's controller and you convert Megatron.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Determining what excess damage would be dealt to a creature is similar to how combat damage from a creature with trample is handled. Start with the amount of damage being dealt to the creature and determine what is "lethal." This is usually the creature's toughness minus the amount of damage that it already has marked on it, but ignoring any replacement or prevention effects that will modify this damage. Also ignore whether the creature has an ability such as indestructible that will result in it not being destroyed by this damage.</li>
	<li>Once you've determined that there would be excess damage and how much damage is excess, Megatron simultaneously deals damage to the creature and to that creature's controller, then converts. The damage may be modified by replacement or prevention effects.</li>
	<li>If the target creature is an illegal target by the time the reflexive triggered ability tries to resolve, the ability won't resolve. It won't deal damage to any player.</li>
	<li>If Megatron has deathtouch as the reflexive triggered ability resolves, 1 damage is lethal damage, and any amount beyond that is excess damage.</li>

We feel that this has impacted some players' ability to enjoy the game. As such, we will soon be restricting how the country-specific cards sleeves appear in game:</p>

<ul>
<li>Players who previously acquired these sleeves will still see them in their collection and may still apply them to decks.</li>
<li>During matches, only the player who has these card sleeves applied will see them on their deck; it will appear as the default card back to opponents.</li>
<li>Players will receive 300 gems per flag card sleeve in their collection when this change goes live, regardless of how they originally obtained the sleeve(s).</li>

<p>As always, I'll try to answer as many questions as I can, but here's why I might not answer your question:</p>

<ul>
	<li>I have an allotted word count, which means that there are only so many questions I can get to.</li>
	<li>Someone else might have asked the same question. I will usually answer the first person who asks.</li>
	<li>Some questions I either don't know the answer to or don't feel qualified enough in the area to answer properly.</li>
	<li>Some topics I'm not allowed to answer for all sorts of reasons, including previews for future sets.</li>
</ul>

<p>That said, let's get to the questions:</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/da_ninja_monkey/status/1573357672358940674" target="_blank">Q: What card made you laugh the hardest?</a></strong></p>

<p>I think the card that made the design team and playtesters laugh the most consistently was <auto-card>Wicker Picker</auto-card>. There were numerous playtests where I was thinking of possibly cutting it and then everyone would giggle about it the whole time, and I'd keep it in. I said to myself, one day there will a playtest where it doesn't make people laugh, and I'll have the serious conversation about removing it, but that day never came.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/SandwurmFood/status/1573358627871928321" target="_blank">Q: If you had to reprint and de-acorn any previous <em>Un-</em> card so it could see play in Eternal formats, what card would you pick?</a></strong></p>

<p>The card I get asked the most to make Eternal legal is <auto-card>Krark's Other Thumb</auto-card> from <em>Unstable</em>.</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Krark's Other Thumb" src="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=439540&type=card" /></p>

<p>Ever since<em> Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Adventures in the Forgotten Realms </em>brought die rolling to non-<em>Un-</em> formats, there's been a lot of desire to bring some of the die-rolling manipulation from <em>Un-</em> sets to Eternal formats, and <auto-card>Krark's Other Thumb</auto-card> seems to be the focal point of that desire.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/FoFunnies/status/1573358587795177472" target="_blank">Q: How does collation work for different versions/variants of the same card?</a></strong></p>

<p>When you print<em> Magic</em> cards, you print a whole bunch of cards on one large sheet. The most normal sheet size is eleven cards by eleven cards (for a total of 121 cards). After the sheets are printed, they're cut into individual cards. The sheets are usually separated by slots. Normally, that's rarity (a booster gets so many slots for cards of each rarity), but when you have special things, like Attractions that have a different back, they get their own slot. Most sheets don't have 121 unique cards on a sheet, so cards will be repeated on the sheet. We knew that when we made Attractions, so I was aware it gave us the opportunity to have variants that had different lit-up numbers. How many versions was limited by how many times that particular card appeared on the sheet. Common Attractions appeared ten times, uncommon six, and rare two.</p>

<p>We also had to care how many different light-up combinations there were. Because 1 never lights up and 6 always does, having two lit numbers meant you had four versions (2/6, 3/6, 4/6, and 5/6). Having three lit numbers meant you had six versions (2/3/6, 2/4/6, 2/5/6, 3/4/6, 3/5/6, and 4/5/6). Having four lit numbers meant four versions (2/3/4/6, 2/3/5/6, 2/4/5/6, and 3/4/5/6). This meant that common and uncommon would have four or six copies depending on how many lit-up numbers it had. Rare would only have two regardless of how many lit-up numbers the Attraction had.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/Krog42/status/1573358972605960192" target="_blank">Q: Do you look over past <em>Un-</em> sets to find ideas that can be better implemented a second time? Like Just Desserts and Pie-roclasm?</a></strong></p>

<p>In any <em>Magic</em> design, not just <em>Un-</em> sets, you look back at what worked in the past for inspiration for new cards. Lots of <em>Unfinity</em> cards were inspired by popular <em>Un-</em> cards. Some examples (other than Pie-roclasm and <auto-card>Just Desserts</auto-card>):</p>

<ul>
	<li><auto-card>Animate Graveyard</auto-card> was inspired by <auto-card>Animate Library</auto-card> from <em>Unstable</em>.</li>
	<li><auto-card>Grand Marshal Macie</auto-card> was inspired by <auto-card>Staying Power</auto-card> from <em>Unhinged</em>.</li>
	<li><auto-card>It Came from Planet Glurg</auto-card> was inspired by <auto-card>Grusilda, Monster Masher</auto-card> from<em> Unstable</em>.</li>
	<li><auto-card>Opening Ceremony</auto-card> was inspired by <auto-card>Booster Tutor</auto-card> from <em>Unhinged</em> and <auto-card>Summon the Pack</auto-card> from <em>Unstable</em>.</li>
	<li><auto-card>Surprise Party</auto-card> was inspired by <auto-card>Cheatyface</auto-card> from <em>Unhinged</em> and <auto-card>Entirely Normal Armchair</auto-card> from <em>Unstable</em>.</li>
	<li><auto-card>Truss, Chief Engineer</auto-card> was inspired by <auto-card>More or Less</auto-card> from <em>Unstable</em>.</li>
	<li><auto-card>Vedalken Squirrel-Whacker</auto-card> was inspired by <auto-card>Elvish Impersonators</auto-card> from <em>Unglued</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>I should note that, although we take inspiration from old cards, we still try to find new ways to execute on old mechanics, which often creates different types of gameplay than would the old cards.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/riptideprolab/status/1573359207818330112" target="_blank">Q: When <em>Unfinity</em> was conceived, was there feedback to include more specific <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> references compared to <em>Unstable</em>? I got the sense that UST's in-joke : original joke ratio wasn't as good as it could be.</a></strong></p>

<p>There wasn't any specific feedback to add more of that. Our first goal is always to build a fun and immersive world. As with <em>Unstable</em>, even if the world is not self-referential, we can find spots to make <em>Magic</em> references. Luckily, early in worldbuilding, we came up with the idea that the park uses the <em>Magic</em> IP and that just allowed us a huge amount of flexibility in referencing the game. I think it's a little more than we necessarily need to make in an <em>Un-</em> set, but I agree it's a lot of fun when we have it.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/harbor_jim/status/1573359922095730689" target="_blank">Q: Two of the acorn cards are only acorns because they make pink tokens. If you wanted as much Eternal legal stuff as possible why not change the color of the token to something else?</a></strong></p>

<p>This was the byproduct of a late decision-making process. At that point, we'd already made the Teddy Bear token frame and art. Also, we'd chosen to have <auto-card>Water Gun Balloon Game</auto-card> as our release-day promo, and that had a pink Teddy Bear. We did look to see if we could swap which cards had the Teddy Bear tokens (ideally, with Attractions that were already acorn), but there weren't good options. For Gift Shop, the other options were either 1/1 and too close to the red Balloon or a much worse flavor fit (flying 2/2 cats, 4/4 Octopus Performer, 1/2 flying Storm Crows, etc.). For Push Your Luck, it had to be a base 2/2, and the only other 2/2 creature token was the Zombie Employee, which didn't make any sense as a prize.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/FoFunnies/status/1573360742740684801" target="_blank">Q: For Octo Opus, you must fold something the size of a standard <em>Magic</em> card? Can you use a token or advertisement card instead?</a></strong></p>

<p>There is a specific double-faced Contortionist token, but you're allowed to use any <em>Magic</em> card for your folding, including ad or token cards.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/Sora_Tonin/status/1573361343641665539" target="_blank">Q: What made you want to make some cards legal [and] some not?</a></strong></p>

<p>I just want players to be able to play the cards where they want to play them. I understand why certain cards need to be acorn, because they do things that the rules can't handle or dip into aspects of the game that don't work well with tournament play, but if there are cards in an <em>Un-</em> set that would be totally playable if printed in any other set, why not let the players play with them in Eternal formats? <em>Magic </em>does quirky mechanical things all the time in other sets. We do comedic cards in other sets. We push boundaries in other sets. The idea that an <em>Un-</em> card has to be off-limits solely for having the property of being an <em>Un-</em> card is, I believe, an outdated concept. That's why the set has Eternal-legal cards.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/thatguyranen/status/1573363377447243776" target="_blank">Q: What were the considerations made to determine if a card was 'acorned'?</a></strong></p>

<p>I put together a team of four people: Jess Dunks, the rules manager; Carmen Handy from the Play Design team; Matt Tabak, the set's editor; and myself. We looked at each card and asked the following questions:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Does it work within the rules?</strong> If the answer was no, it became acorn.</li>
	<li><strong>Would it cause problems in a tournament setting?</strong> If the answer was yes, it became acorn.</li>
	<li><strong>Does it cause any problems in Legacy or Vintage?</strong> If the answer was yes, we tweaked it. If it still wasn't safe enough, we made it acorn.</li>
	<li><strong>Can the card be templated in a way that fits on the card?</strong> (Acorn cards have some freedom with how they template that can allow us to write things we normally couldn't.) If the answer is no, the card became acorn.</li>
	<li><strong>Does the card feel appropriate as an Eternal card?</strong> This was the most subjective of the questions, but there were some cards like <auto-card>Tug of War</auto-card> that passed all the early questions yet still felt wrong as an Eternal card to the majority of people who looked at it. Those were made acorn.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/Frosty_mage/status/1573502073345294345" target="_blank">Q: Were there any cards that you fought particularly hard to make Eternal-legal, whether or not they ended up making it?</a></strong></p>

<p>It was never about fighting to make something Eternal or not. My job was to make a clear delineated line between acorn and Eternal and then, with proper input, figure out on which side of the line each card stood. I did want anything that could be Eternal to be Eternal in the sense that I wanted as many cards as possible to be something players could play without having to ask permission, but I never wanted to make something Eternal that fundamentally shouldn't be. In fact, when there was a question about whether something should be Eternal, I tended to err on the side of caution and make it acorn.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/Frosty_mage/status/1573501835817664525" target="_blank">Q: What card(s) were you the most surprised made it into Eternal formats?</a></strong></p>

<p>The one that shocked me most when Jess said it worked in the rules was <auto-card>Exchange of Words</auto-card>. I was convinced that card was bound to be acorn but was pleasantly surprised when I discovered it could be Eternal.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><magic-card>Exchange of Words</magic-card></p>

<p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/MichaelLoughna6/status/1573361603600613376" target="_blank">Q: Were Attractions not being Pauper legal by virtue of card count an intentional design choice, or did it just happen to turn out that way?</a></strong></p>

<p>To explain before I answer the question: There are ten common Attractions, but only eight that are Eternal legal. To use Attractions in a Constructed format, you have to make a Singleton Attraction deck of at least ten cards. Since Pauper only has access to common cards, there aren't enough legal Attractions in the format to build an Attraction deck.</p>

<p>It wasn't a conscious choice. We just made the cards, put them in the rarity that made sense, and judged whether they were acorn or Eternal by the guidelines above. Our general rule is that we make the right decisions for the set, and things get applied to Pauper as the rules dictate. I'll admit I am sad that Pauper players won't get a chance to play with Attractions, as they're quite fun.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/Grendelsbacon/status/1573361708453822465" target="_blank">Q: Was there any discussion about separating the Commander card pool from Legacy and Vintage to sequester it from <em>Unfinity</em>?</a></strong></p>

<p>Constructed legality for Commander is run by the Commander Rules Committee and not by Wizards, so it's not something we have control over.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/NoCHillDC/status/1573362425394597889" target="_blank">Q: With the hopeful continued success of <em>Un-</em> sets, would you rather continue to explore new tropes or return to Bablovia or the Astrotorium in a future <em>Un-</em> set?</a></strong></p>

<p>We do <em>Un-</em> sets infrequently enough that I'm more inclined to explore new worlds rather than revisit old ones, but as <em>Unfinity</em> shows, we can have a little crossover between worlds. Both <auto-card>Urza, Academy Headmaster</auto-card> and <auto-card>Spike, Tournament Grinder</auto-card> make an appearance in the set.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/SquirrelDragon/status/1573365909342900225" target="_blank">Q: With <em>Unfinity</em> representing various aspects of theme parks and carnivals, such as a specific rides, carnival games, shows, etc., are there any specific aspects that you wanted to translate into cards but didn't quite fit the theme?</a></strong></p>

<p>I think we did a pretty good job of hitting most of the carnival, amusement park, and circus tropes. We made an extensive list during exploratory design, and the finished product represents almost everything we listed. I guess the one area we fell a little shy in was representing specific carnival games. While we have several games on Attractions, we wanted to make sure the flavor matched the minigame you were actually playing, so there were some classic games that fell through the cracks like a shooting gallery or a horse race where you roll balls into holes. We did manage to get a few games as background on cards (the milk ball toss and <auto-card>Grabby Tabby</auto-card> as an example), but that's the one area that we didn't hit everything on our list. The other area we fell short on tropes was science fiction. When we began, I thought we'd have more space to hit basic science fiction tropes than we did. There are spaceships and robots and aliens, but we left a lot of science fiction tropes on the cutting floor.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/Tarsam06745840/status/1573363518417797120" target="_blank">Q: What card was most fun to design?</a></strong></p>

<p>Almost all the cards were fun to design, but as this is a question, I'll pick one. I think the earliest card that got designed that made it into the set was <auto-card>Animate Object</auto-card>. Annie Sardelis designed the first card with this effect in exploratory design (animating hand sanitizer), and we knew immediately that it was something special. We had endless fun in playtests animating crazier and crazier objects with it. Early on, it just said "object outside the game," so I animated a fellow R&amp;D member. After that, we added "inanimate."</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/Leopokoyo1/status/1573391902078275586" target="_blank">Q: For Goblin Cruciverbalist, are there any restrictions? Does it have to be a sanctioned word in a dictionary?</a></strong></p>

<p>Yes, it must be a word you would find in a dictionary. And note, <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/unfinity-release-notes-2022-10-07" target="_blank">as it says in the FAQ</a>, you're allowed to use each permanent's letter just once. So, if you have three permanents starting with A, B, and N, you can spell BAN or NAB, but not BANANA.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/thetday/status/1573381922856009728" target="_blank">Q: Numerically, is Unfinity larger or smaller than Infinity?</a></strong></p>

<p>Larger. Unfinity is infinity plus pi.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/SilverSwag_TCG/status/1573361292198420482" target="_blank">Q: Why aren't the acorn cards silver border while the Eternal cards keep black border?</a></strong></p>

<p>For the acorn cards to be silver border and the Eternal cards to be black border, we would need to have them on different printing sheets. This would require a different mix of cards in the two categories than currently exists. Because the acorn/Eternal decision was made late in the process, we were already past the point where those changes could have been made.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/mowdownjoe/status/1573364480964165633" target="_blank">Q: Is there a reason Clown Car doesn't reward you for crewing it with all your clowns?</a></strong></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><magic-card>Clown Car</magic-card></p>

<p>We did have an early version that did that, but none of them played all that well, so we changed to the current version. We decided that all the Clown token making when you cast it represents all the Clowns climbing out of the car.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/FoFunnies/status/1573361721359597568" target="_blank">Q: For Cover the Spot, can I use Planechase or Archenemy cards or only standard <em>Magic</em>-sized cards?</a></strong></p>

<p>As stated in <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/unfinity-release-notes-2022-10-07" target="_blank">the <em>Unfinity</em> FAQ</a>, whenever a card requires you use a <em>Magic</em> card from outside the game, it has to be a normal <em>Magic</em>-sized card. Sorry.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/mtg_ds/status/1573382376755003392" target="_blank">Q: For Bar Entry, how did you decide how high to set the bar? Careful measurement of popular staples? Simulations based on popular decklists? R&amp;D's least favorite creature to face with 3 or less power?</a></strong></p>

<p>So, we took a whole bunch of creature cards we had in the Pit and measured them all. We then set the bar so it would hit about one fourth of the creatures. It was all very scientific.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/wobbles/status/1573388374144323584" target="_blank">Q: Do you consider Shahrazad part of the subgame super cycle?</a></strong></p>

<p>We do.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in"><strong>White</strong> – <auto-card>Shahrazad</auto-card> (<em>Arabian Nights</em>)</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in"><strong>Black</strong> – <auto-card>Enter the Dungeon</auto-card> (<em>Unhinged</em>)</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in"><strong>Red</strong> – <auto-card>The Countdown Is at One</auto-card> (<em>Unstable</em>)</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in"><strong>Green</strong> – <auto-card>Tug of War</auto-card> (<em>Unfinity</em>)</p>

<p>Which means, yes, the next <em>Un-</em> set will most likely have a blue subgame card.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/PhyrexianHippo/status/1573437369470144520" target="_blank">Q: What is your personal favorite "Easter egg" in <em>Unfinity</em>?</a></strong></p>

<p>It's either <auto-card>Bag Check</auto-card> or <auto-card>Prize Wall</auto-card>. Both have a whole bunch of visual Easter eggs in their art.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/CRRMcRae/status/1573413390391054338" target="_blank">Q: If I choose a character for Vorthos, does it also count representations of the character or epithets of that character such as a statue or, for Bolas, cards that mention God-Pharaoh?</a></strong></p>

<h2 style="color:red"><strong>[WARNING: THERE ARE STORY REVEALS, ALTHOUGH OLD, IN THIS ANSWER]</strong></h2>

<p>Yes. If you choose a character, you get all versions of that character, even ones that use a different name. For example, if you say Lim-Dûl, <auto-card>Vorthos, Steward of Myth</auto-card> will also count the Raven Man. If you say Urza, Vorthos will count the Blind Seer. If you say Nicol Bolas (from the past as he currently doesn't have a name), you count God-Pharoah.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/wobbles/status/1573388934633095168" target="_blank">Q: Why did Brushwaggs get singled out on the Unique Charmed Pants sticker?</a></strong></p>

<p>The word "non-Brushwagg" shows up on both <auto-card>Embiggen</auto-card> and the Unique Charmed Pants sticker. The reason for this, other than it being funny, is to prevent these two abilities from being able to target creatures with changeling. We wanted both to be Eternal legal, and if they could target cards with changeling, they'd be too good. "Non-Brushwagg" was our creative solution.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/zackwind/status/1573412024000081920" target="_blank">Q: What was the rationale for including shock lands in this product?</a></strong></p>

<p>For many years, full-art lands were an exclusive of the <em>Un-</em> sets. Because full-art lands now show up in other sets, we wanted to add something new to the land slots. The idea of dual lands with outer space art just seemed too cool to pass up. I asked what dual lands we could have and was told the shock lands. I wasn't going to turn that down.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/ChainLinkSense/status/1573496761565356032" target="_blank">Q: What are the draft archetypes?</a></strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>White-blue</strong>: Name stickers matter</li>
	<li><strong>Blue-black</strong>: Dice manipulation (getting specific die rolls); works well with Attractions</li>
	<li><strong>Black-red</strong>: High die rolls matter (getting rewarded for high rolls); works well with Attractions</li>
	<li><strong>Red-green</strong>: Roll a lot of dice (getting rewarded for rolling many dice in one turn); works well with Attractions</li>
	<li><strong>Green-white</strong>: Ability stickers matter</li>
	<li><strong>White-black</strong>: Hats matter</li>
	<li><strong>Blue-red</strong>: Art stickers matter</li>
	<li><strong>Black-green</strong>: Attractions matter (You're rewarded for visiting a lot of Attractions.)</li>
	<li><strong>Red-white</strong>: Clown Robot aggro</li>
	<li><strong>Green-blue</strong>: Power/toughness stickers matter</li>
</ul>

I was given a list of all of them to pick from, so I chose a theme near and dear to my heart: Shapeshifters. I'm going to use today's column to walk through the early history of Shapeshifters and then introduce you to the new Jumpstart Booster, including a preview of the new card in it. Sound good?</p>

<h2>Copy That</h2>

<p>Interestingly, the concept of the Shapeshifter creature type goes all the way back to <em>Alpha</em>, but the word itself doesn't get used as a creature type for a few years. When Richard Garfield made the initial game, he knew that he wanted a couple cards that played into the fantasy trope of shapeshifters. Shapeshifting as a theme can be found in countless mythologies and goes back as far as recorded storytelling. Its fantastical nature meant that it quickly became a staple device in fantasy stories.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img alt="Clone" src="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=99&amp;type=card" /> <img alt="Vesuvan Doppelganger" src="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=135&amp;type=card" /></p>

<p>The first two Shapeshifters to show up (although, again, they were not creature type Shapeshifter yet) were Clone and Vesuvan Doppelganger. Both could become copies of other creatures. The Clone merely did it once upon entering the battlefield, while the Vesuvan Doppelganger could keep changing. Both cards were very popular and saw a lot of play in early <em>Magic</em> (blue being the strongest color didn't hurt). I personally was enamored with both cards and built numerous decks around them.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img alt="Primal Clay" src="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=1017&amp;type=card" /> <img alt="Shapeshifter" src="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=1020&amp;type=card" /> <img alt="Urza's Avenger" src="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=1030&amp;type=card" /></p>

<p><em>Antiquities</em>, <em>Magic</em>'s second expansion, was the second set to introduce creatures that change their shape. Unlike <em>Alpha</em>, this was represented through the creature changing something about themselves rather than copying another creature. Primal Clay lets you choose one of three forms when you cast it, Shapeshifter allows you to redistribute its power and toughness, and Urza's Avenger can temporarily lose power and toughness in exchange for gaining abilities. Each of these cards pushed the idea of shapeshifting into new mechanical space. None of these creatures had a creature type because, at the time, artifact creatures didn't have creature types. Shapeshifter is the first time the word "Shapeshifter" appears on a card, though.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img alt="Halfdane" src="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=1655&amp;type=card" /> <img alt="Sentinel" src="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=1421&amp;type=card" /></p>

<p><em>Legends</em> takes yet a different mechanical approach to shapeshifting. Both Halfdane and Sentinel can change their power and/or toughness based on copying other creatures. Unlike Clone and Vesuvan Doppelganger, they don't become a copy but use another creature to reset their stats. Neither had the creature type Shapeshifter because legendary creatures only used the creature type Legend at the time and, again, artifact creatures didn't yet have a creature type. Legendary becoming a supertype rather than a creature type on creatures was many years away. I should point out that Halfdane was the first legendary creature to (retroactively) be a Shapeshifter.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img alt="Shyft" src="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=2532&amp;type=card" /></p>

<p>A whole year goes by until we see another Shapeshifter. <em>Ice Age</em> has Shyft, which can change its color. Note that it doesn't copy color, it just allows its controller to choose whatever color(s) they wish.</p>

<p>It's interesting to note that the only defining quality of shapeshifting creatures by this time is their ability to change something about themselves. The designers keep experimenting with what changes, though. So far, we've seen shifts in size, abilities, and color, in addition to straight up copying. Shyft isn't a creature type Shapeshifter because it's labeled a Shyft. This was a common occurrence in early <em>Magic</em> where instead of trying to tie creatures into larger categories, quirky creatures were just given their name as a creature type.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img alt="Escaped Shapeshifter" src="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=4699&amp;type=card" /> <img alt="Unstable Shapeshifter" src="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=4740&amp;type=card" /></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img alt="Dracoplasm" src="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=4912&amp;type=card" /> <img alt="Flowstone Sculpture" src="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=4608&amp;type=card" /></p>

<p>The next set with Shapeshifters was <em>Tempest</em>. Unstable Shapeshifter was just a Vesuvan Doppelganger, but one that changed what it was at a different time. The other three cards were pushing into new space.</p>

<p>Escaped Shapeshifter was able to copy elements of other creatures, evergreen keywords, which it could mix and match. Dracoplasm was my first attempt at squishing two creatures together. The rules at the time couldn't handle a lot of the complexities, so it just adopts their combined power and toughness. The original design was much closer to what you would see with <em>Unstable</em>'s Grusilda, Monster Masher or<em> Ikoria: Lair of Behemoth</em>'s mutate mechanic. It was an idea a bit ahead of its time. Flowstone Sculpture was a creature that could adapt and change over time, but each change was permanent.</p>

<p><em>Tempest </em>would also be the set where we finally get the creature type Shapeshifter. I'd been a big advocate of the concept, as I wanted to be able to build decks that combined different Shapeshifters, so I pushed to get it consolidated into a single word. Shapeshifter seemed like the most open-ended yet descriptive choice. Flowstone Sculpture doesn't get the Shapeshifter creature type because my years-long goal to get creature types for artifact creatures hadn't paid off yet.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img alt="Volrath's Shapeshifter" src="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=5262&amp;type=card" /></p>

<p>You can see my love for Vesuvan Doppelganger continue as I keep making new riffs on it. Volrath's Shapeshifter is from <em>Stronghold</em>.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img alt="Morphling" src="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=5863&amp;type=card" /></p>

<p>Interestingly, Morphling from <em>Urza's Saga</em> began as a reprint of Clone. I'd always adored the card and wanted to bring it back to Standard. For some reason, late in development, after the art was already in, the rules manager at the time informed me that we couldn't reprint Clone due to some weird rules problem with it. (To this day, I never understood what the rules issue was.) We designed the card to match the art, choosing to give the creature a lot of flexibility in what it was. It could change its stats. It could gain abilities. The only thing it didn't do was copy anything, as I was told that was off-limits.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img alt="Anthroplasm" src="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=12387&amp;type=card" /></p>

<p>Anthroplasm from <em>Urza's Legacy</em> just grew over time. You could spend mana to put +1/+1 counters on it. While this matches the feel of a Shapeshifter, the ability isn't particularly blue. If we made this card today, it would be a green card.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img alt="Volrath the Fallen" src="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=21328&amp;type=card" /></p>

<p>Volrath was designed to be the main antagonist of the <em>Weatherlight</em> Saga. His shapeshifting was a key part of the story because he disguises himself as part of the crew (as Takara, Starke's daughter) for a bit of the story. This was the first time a Shapeshifter was a major character in the story, and in <em>Nemesis</em>, we finally made him a card.</p>

<p>Looking back at it, it's a little lackluster for what was a major villain at the time. He doesn't copy anything, he just makes himself larger. I assume part of this was due to him being mono-black. Speaking of which, Volrath is the first Shapeshifter to be neither part blue nor an artifact. He wasn't printed as a Shapeshifter, though, as legendary hadn't made the leap to a supertype on creatures yet.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img alt="Dralnu's Pet" src="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=15144&amp;type=card" /></p>

<p><em>Planeshift</em>'s Dralnu is another Shapeshifter that basically changes its size (and can gain flying). It's the first with kicker, but other than that, nothing too extraordinary.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img alt="Shifty Doppelganger" src="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=31823&amp;type=card" /></p>

<p>Shifty Doppelganger from <em>Odyssey</em> is a quirky design. It's using shapeshifting flavor to justify what's basically a red effect (playing a card from your hand, giving it haste, and sacrificing it at end of turn). If we were making it today and it was still blue, it would probably have you discard a card to turn this card into a copy of the discarded card until end of turn.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img alt="Riptide Shapeshifter" src="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=25812&amp;type=card" /></p>

<p><em>Onslaught</em>'s Riptide Shapeshifter is the first time a Shapeshifter is represented mechanically with an element of randomness. It can change shape, but you don't know into what. This ability has since been moved from blue to red. Blue can turn into things from the library as long as it knows what it's becoming. If the change is random, that ability now belongs in red.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img alt="Dermoplasm" src="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=44300&amp;type=card" /> <img alt="Mistform Ultimus" src="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=45840&amp;type=card" /></p>

<p>Dermoplasm from <em>Legions</em> is playing into a mechanical theme that was starting to show up more often: having the Shapeshifter change by literally becoming a different card. The flavor here was that when you un-morph Dermoplasm, it could be any morph creature from your hand. This was playing in more dangerous territory from a play design standpoint because you could turn into creatures you might not yet have the mana to cast.</p>

<p>Mistform Ultimus wasn't printed with Shapeshifter on its card, but it was the first creature to have all creature types, so I'm listing it here. It would pave the way for the first Shapeshifter-specific keyword. (More on that in a bit.)</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img alt="Proteus Machine" src="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=46705&amp;type=card" /></p>

<p>Adding creature types is something Shapeshifters can change about themselves (without needing to fully copy another creature). Proteus Machine from <em>Scourge</em> was designed as a card to help connect morph to creature-type strategies. Again, not a Shapeshifter when printed because artifact creatures still couldn't have creature types.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img alt="Duplicant" src="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=49439&amp;type=card" /></p>

<p>Duplicant is the first Shapeshifter to use its copying ability as a kill card. We were trying to find innovative ways to use the imprint mechanic, and it dawned on us that we could use the opponent's creature to set qualities about the imprinting card. Also of note, we used the introduction of an artifact-themed set, <em>Mirrodin</em>, to start finally giving creature types to artifact creatures. This makes Duplicant the first artifact creature to be printed as a Shapeshifter.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img alt="Death-Mask Duplicant" src="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=46023&amp;type=card" /></p>

<p><em>Darksteel</em>'s Death-Mask Duplicant finds a different way to use imprint on a Shapeshifter. This time, you get to exile creature cards from your graveyard to permanently gain their (at the time) evergreen abilities.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img alt="_____" src="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=74252&amp;type=card" /> <img alt="Greater Morphling" src="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=74296&amp;type=card" /></p>

<p>_____ (the card from <em>Unhinged </em>with no name) finds a silver-border (now acorn) quality to change: its name and flavor text. Also a first, the names and flavor text you can gain have to be from an existing card—not necessarily one on the battlefield, just one that exists in the game. This is the first time a Shapeshifter could potentially copy something that isn't in the game. Greater Morphling was just a parody of Morphling, so it obviously needed the same creature type.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img alt="Shape Stealer" src="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=88823&amp;type=card" /></p>

<p>Shape Stealer, from <em>Saviors of Kamigawa</em>, is playing into a popular trope from pop culture where the Shapeshifter becomes the creature that it's fighting. It's also the first Shapeshifter printed with a creature type other than Shapeshifter (Spirit).</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img alt="Dimir Doppelganger" src="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=83850&amp;type=card" /></p>

<p>We've had Shapeshifters that copy dying creatures and ones that copy elements of things from the graveyard, but <em>Ravnica</em>'s Dimir Doppelganger is the first to copy dead creatures straight up.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img alt="Vesuvan Shapeshifter" src="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=109765&amp;type=card" /></p>

<p>For <em>Time Spiral</em>, we had a lot of fun taking old cards and redesigning them with mechanical tweaks. Vesuvan Doppelganger is an inspiration yet again, this time for a morph creature that uses un-morphing as its means to copy other creatures. It was part of a rare cycle of morph creatures that hint at older cards.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img alt="Aquamorph Entity" src="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=126024&amp;type=card" /> <img alt="Body Double" src="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=124443&amp;type=card" /> <img alt="Jodah's Avenger" src="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=124482&amp;type=card" /></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img alt="Primal Plasma" src="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=124757&amp;type=card" /> <img alt="Torchling" src="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=126810&amp;type=card" /></p>

<p><em>Planar Chaos</em> was about an alternate-reality look at <em>Magic</em>. The inspiration for a number of these changes were old Shapeshifter cards from above. Aquamorph Entity was a morph take on a card like the original Shapeshifter. Body Double was a blue card using blue-flavored abilities to mimic a staple ability in black: reanimation. Jodah's Avenger was a riff on Urza's Avenger. Primal Plasma was a color-shifted version of Primal Clay. Torchling was a red tweak on Morphling.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img alt="Mirror Entity" src="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=141818&amp;type=card" /> <img alt="Shapesharer" src="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=140200&amp;type=card" /> <img alt="Cairn Wanderer" src="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=140171&amp;type=card" /></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img alt="Changeling Berserker" src="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=145804&amp;type=card" /> <img alt="Changeling Titan" src="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=140345&amp;type=card" /></p>

<p>We end our Shapeshifter history lesson with <em>Lorwyn</em>. A good place to end, as it's the first time Shapeshifters get a mechanic to themselves. <em>Lorwyn</em> had a strong creature-type theme, and we needed something to act as glue to tie the relevant eight creature types together. The inspiration for that glue was Mistform Ultimus (see above). Having Shapeshifters in the set that counted for every creature type allowed players to mix and match different themes and helped all the creature types hit the as-fan they needed to work in Limited. Creatures with changeling would go on to become a fan favorite and have returned numerous times.</p>

<h2>The Shapeshifter of Things to Come</h2>

<p>Which brings us to today's Jumpstart Booster. Shapeshifter is a theme that only shows up in a single version. Its booster has one rare and one mythic rare. Every Jumpstart Booster has at least one rare or mythic rare, but there are boosters that have more than one (such as the Shapeshifter Jumpstart Booster). I'm going to walk you through all the cards in it and explain the reasoning behind how the booster was built. The Shapeshifter Jumpstart Booster was built by Corey Bowen, so I talked with him about the reasoning behind the card choices.</p>

<p><strong>Pirated Copy (mythic rare)</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img alt="Pirated Copy" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/j22/en_RZX1KcLPF0.png" /></p>

<p>The mythic rare is the new design. Each Jumpstart Booster has one new card. Corey said his goal with this card was to make something simple, as it's <em>Jumpstart 2022</em>, but with a novel twist. Pirated Copy is basically a Clone variant (it enters as a copy of a creature on the battlefield), but it grants all creatures with the same name as the clone what we in R&amp;D nickname the "Curiosity ability" (whenever you deal combat damage to another player, draw a card). Clones copying is pretty normal, but granting abilities to all creatures with the same name is playing in new space. Interestingly, you can copy whatever creature you like, but as you're granting the creature you copy a positive ability, you're encouraged to copy your own creature. Because <em>Jumpstart 2022</em> cards like to be fun and flavorful, it was made a Shapeshifter Pirate.</p>

<p><strong>Gigantoplasm (rare)</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img alt="Gigantoplasm" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/j22/en_MqvxJPSctk.png" /></p>

<p>This is the rare in the booster. It's another Clone variant. This version has a mana sink built into it so that in the late game you can use your mana to help break through board stalls.</p>

<p><strong>Mirror Image (uncommon)</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img alt="Mirror Image" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/j22/en_d0K5lDUka0.png" /></p>

<p>Corey was trying to get a bunch of Clones into this booster, but normally Clones are rare or mythic rare. Mirror Image was one of the few Clone options at uncommon. It's also a little lower on the curve than the other two Clones. Note that one card in each booster has new anime-inspired art, and Mirror Image is the card with this in the Shapeshifter booster.</p>

<p><strong>Bloodline Pretender (uncommon)</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img alt="Bloodline Pretender" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/j22/en_MBYkQvxhSW.png" /></p>

<p>Only so much of the booster could be Clones, so Corey filled out the rest with changeling creatures. Creatures with changeling are Shapeshifters to hit the booster theme and provide the mechanical glue that allows the cards to interact with creature-type themes from other boosters. One of the goals of building a Jumpstart Booster is choosing cards that are open-ended enough to play nicely with cards from other boosters. Because most of the creatures in this booster have changeling, you can use them to choose a creature type from among creatures in the other booster you pick for your <em>Jumpstart</em> deck. This works especially well with other Jumpstart Boosters that have creature-type themes.</p>

<p><strong>Lookout's Dispersal (uncommon)</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img alt="Lookout's Dispersal" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/j22/en_0xF8cO3Oo8.png" /></p>

<p>Each Jumpstart Booster has three or four non-creature spells. Some of these need to be answers to your opponent's threats. Lookout's Dispersal is a counterspell with a creature-type theme (in this case Pirates) that plays nicely with changeling.</p>

<p><strong>Heirloom Blade (uncommon)</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img alt="Heirloom Blade" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/j22/en_LNSFvAmh2R.png" /></p>

<p>This is the one noncreature spell to buff your own creatures. Heirloom Blade can always be used on your changeling creatures, so you can get any creature when it dies, but if your companion booster has a creature-type theme, you could choose that as well.</p>

<p><strong>Universal Automaton (common)</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img alt="Universal Automaton" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/j22/en_GsS5BHk2TB.png" /></p>

<p>Universal Automaton is a one-drop changeling creature to help with your curve while keeping you on theme. The generic mana cost also helps you cast it on turn one.</p>

<p><strong>Amoeboid Changeling (common)</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img alt="Amoeboid Changeling" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/j22/en_DPZTC8pC7p.png" /></p>

<p>Amoeboid Changeling is both a changeling creature and a card that can manipulate the creature types of your other creatures. This will be especially helpful with creatures from your other booster.</p>

<p><strong>Mistwalker (common)</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img alt="Mistwalker" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/j22/en_0AZHqfyfhL.png" /></p>

<p>Mistwalker has changeling, flying, and is a mana sink. Corey said he chose it because it did everything the deck needed.</p>

<p><strong>Littjara Kinseekers (common)</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img alt="Littjara Kinseekers" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/j22/en_WxDmbyEFVS.png" /></p>

<p>Littjara Kinseekers is a four-drop changeling creature that plays into your deck's theme, most often dropping as a 3/5.</p>

<p><strong>Chilling Trap (common)</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img alt="Chilling Trap" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/j22/en_VpozUjH3UK.png" /></p>

<p>Chilling Trap is another answer card that has a reward for having a certain creature type. Corey liked the deck referencing a lot of different creatures. It made it feel more novel and still worked with all the changeling creatures.</p>

<p><strong>Crashing Tide (common)</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img alt="Crashing Tide" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/j22/en_91taFRUMAN.png" /></p>

<p>Crashing Tide is the third answer in the booster that has a creature-type rider, this time a Merfolk.</p>

<p><strong>Thriving Isle (common)</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img alt="Thriving Isle" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/j22/en_SAVlebxQDd.png" /></p>

<p>Every Jumpstart Booster has a Thriving land. Shapeshifters has a Thriving Isle, as it's a blue booster. This gives you access to the two colors of your combined boosters.</p>

<p><strong>Islands (7)</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img alt="Island 1" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/j22/en_QjgM8eef24.png" /> <img alt="Island 1" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/j22/en_QjgM8eef24.png" /> <img alt="Island 1" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/j22/en_QjgM8eef24.png" /></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img alt="Island 2" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/j22/en_BTx4R0s2yY.png" /> <img alt="Island 2" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/j22/en_BTx4R0s2yY.png" /></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img alt="Island 3" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/j22/en_vkNqh9Uf2a.png" /> <img alt="Island 3" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/j22/en_vkNqh9Uf2a.png" /></p>

<p>Each booster has seven basic lands in its color.</p>

<p>The goal of all the boosters is to have a novel theme with fun cards that mix well with the various other boosters. Corey explained that there's a science to making a good Jumpstart Booster and that he got a feel for what works best as he built more of them. Corey is very happy with how the Shapeshifter booster turned out and feels it's a perfect theme for<em> Jumpstart</em> as it so naturally blends with other themes. I hope you all get a chance to try it out.</p>
