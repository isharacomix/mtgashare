<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><em>Gathering</em>&mdash;an assemblage of people; group or crowd.<br /><em>Other words for gathering</em>&mdash;congregation, concourse, company, throng.</p>
<p>You'll have your own definition of what "gathering" means. We may not all be Avengers superheroes, but we certainly assemble. We are grouped together in draft pods and pairings, on the leaderboard, and in the Feature Match area. For some, our game engenders a fervor. Players, judges, casters, staff, and even fans travel the globe routinely. Collectively, we throng to acclaim the latest champion and the decks <em>du jour</em>.</p>
<p>The <em>gathering</em> means a lot. Yet for all the technological advances that have created the global village that's kept us connected for the last three years, it's still a challenge to fully represent our human senses in the virtual space.</p>
<p>Now, as we celebrate our season so far with Pro Tour Phyrexia, we're finally&mdash;truly&mdash;back. We can see the hesitation as a hand hovers above a creature, calculating the choice to attack or not. We can see the relief, the pride, or the puzzlement flicker across our friends' faces when they make decisions. We can hear the flick of the cards, the shuffling, and the dice rolling across the table. We can hear the myriad discussions on lines of play, the roar of triumph, and the hum of the feature match lights with the crowd watching. And we can really touch the cards in our hands, the firm handshake of our opponent, the consoling embrace of a friend, and the heft of a trophy by a champion.</p>
<p>This isn't just <em>Magic</em>&mdash;this is <em>Magic: The Gathering.</em></p>
<p>Our <a href="https://magic.gg/events/pro-tour-phyrexia" target="_blank">Pro Tour Phyrexia</a> showdown&mdash;taking place at <a href="https://mcphiladelphia.mtgfestivals.com/en-us.html" target="_blank">MagicCon: Philadelphia</a> February 17&ndash;19&mdash;begins with nearly 250 competitors settling in to three days of competition. First up, a true spectacle: the draft. Arranged in tables of eight, drawn at random, players will complete three packs of selections from <em>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</em> before whittling down their choices to a 40-card deck. Three rounds follow, with players facing only others within their draft table of eight. This "ringfence" around each draft both ensures fair play&mdash;all your possible opponents drafted from the same set of 24 packs as you did&mdash;and has the human dynamic of knowing that every good card you <em>didn't</em> take could be used against you.</p>
<p>By late lunchtime, 30 or so players will still have a perfect record at 3&ndash;0, 90 or so more will be at 2&ndash;1, with another 90ish at 1&ndash;2, and the final 30 odd players will still be looking to find their first win at 0&ndash;3. That's assuming no draws, of course.</p>
<p>Ah yes&mdash;<em>draws</em>. When a round ends, matches still being played have five additional turns to complete the match. If they can't, and the scores are level, it's a draw. Nobody claims the three match points for victory, but both get a single point for avoiding defeat. (Spoiler: draws are generally <em>bad news</em> for your overall chances.)</p>

<p>Whatever their Draft record, the players will spend Rounds 4 through 8 on Friday playing Pioneer, the Constructed format for the whole weekend. If creatures light your fire, watch out for all-the-way-from-<i>Alpha</i> <auto-card mvid="166">Llanowar Elves</auto-card>; the fairy-tale standouts <auto-card>Bonecrusher Giant</auto-card> and <auto-card>Lovestruck Beast</auto-card>; the <i>compleatly perfect</i> <auto-card>Sheoldred, the Apocalypse</auto-card>; and the unearthly <auto-card>Cityscape Leveler</auto-card>.</p>

<p>In the spell slots, you'll find efficiency everywhere you look, whether that's countering spells with <auto-card>Mystical Dispute</auto-card>, starting a game with discard and <auto-card>Thoughtseize</auto-card>, recounting a saga with <auto-card>Fable of the Mirror-Breaker</auto-card>, or punishing opponents for whatever deck choice they made (<auto-card>Rest in Peace</auto-card>, <auto-card>Damping Sphere</auto-card>, <auto-card>Abrade</auto-card>, and so many more).</p>

<p>And this <i>is</i> Pioneer, so don't forget about the lands. You'll find a ton of nonbasic lands at the top tables, including <auto-card>Boseiju, Who Endures</auto-card>; <auto-card>Otawara, Soaring City</auto-card>; and <auto-card>Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx</auto-card>. With a format as large as Pioneer, nonbasic lands go deep—all the world really is a <auto-card>Thespian's Stage</auto-card>.</p>

<p>As Round 8 closes, 12 match points (or a 4&ndash;4 record or better) is needed to advance to Day Two. Little more than half the field will make it back. For those that don't, it's not all bad. They're still in Philadelphia&mdash;a fabulous east coast city&mdash;and they're still in a building that has amazing <em>Magic</em> opportunities at the rest of the MagicCon. You still <em>want</em> to reach Day Two, but there are some nice consolations if things don't go according to plan.</p>
<p>Saturday? That looks a lot like Friday, with Rounds 9&ndash;11 being <em>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</em> Draft, and then Rounds 12&ndash;16 returning to Pioneer&mdash;and yes, you keep the same deck you registered at the start of the tournament. For a very select few, playing all eight rounds on Saturday won't be necessary. Once you reach twelve match wins (that's 36 match points), you're a lock for Sunday's Top 8 and receive byes for your remaining matches on Saturday.</p>
<p>In theory, our Top 8 slots are open for business from Round 12 onwards. In reality, it's a monumental achievement to book your place early. Expect at least five of the Top 8 to book their appearance in the last round of the day.</p>
<p>That brings us to Sunday. Pioneer is the format once again, with a straight knockout bracket of quarterfinals, semifinals, and finals. Each round is best three out of five games, with sideboarding happening once the first two games have been completed. Nine hours or so of knockout slugfests will bring us to a champion. But who might that champion be?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The obvious place to start is with winners, and there's literally no bigger winner than Nathan Steuer, reigning World Champion. His astonishing victory in Las Vegas last year showcased the beauty of in-person, high-level <em>Magic. </em>Literally (and remember, I use Dictionary.com, so when I say literally, I mean, like, <em>literally</em> literally) we saw tears of despair <em>and</em> of joy from Steuer, a player who embodies the journey, having been in the public gaze since eye-catching Grand Prix performances as a preteen, working his way up through the ranks to the highest point.</p>
<p>Next in line are the group of eleven regional champions. They began the journey just like you can <a href="https://locator.wizards.com/" target="_blank">at a WPN game store</a>, reaching the Regional Championship via a Regional Championship Qualifier (RCQ). Can they do so again at the next level? They may not be household <em>Magic</em> names, but this weekend could go a long way to changing that for some of these:</p>

Not only is it the opening of <a href="https://mcphiladelphia.mtgfestivals.com/en-us.html" target="_blank">MagicCon: Philadelphia</a>—with a teaser of <i>March of the Machine</i>, the next Standard expansion—but the start of <a href="https://magic.gg/events/pro-tour-phyrexia" target="_blank">Pro Tour Phyrexia</a>, the first premier tabletop <i>Magic</i> competitive event since the Players Tour Phoenix in 2020.</p>

<p>Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and Barcelona all host Pro Tours throughout this year, offering a remarkable opportunity for <i>Magic</i>'s best and most promising competitors to battle it out for the coveted title of Pro Tour Champion and a share of the $500,000 prize pool.</p>

<p>With the return of tabletop play, competitive <i>Magic</i> players will try and break Pioneer post-<i>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</i> release while developing Limited knowledge of the recent Standard expansion. In particular, there's one special team that aims to mirror their digital success onto the tabletop: Team Handshake. This team dominated the 2022-23 season, and displayed remarkable success during the <a href="https://magic.gg/events/magic-world-championship-xxviii" target="_blank"><i>Magic</i>World Championship XXVIII</a> in Las Vegas where <a href="https://magic.gg/news/the-week-that-was-the-greatest-steuer-ever-told" target="_blank">Nathan Steuer claimed the trophy.</a></p>

<p>Now they look to maintain a firm grip on the competitive scene. As one of the most successful testing teams in competitive <i>Magic</i>, Team Handshake has a plan to extend its dominant presence with the upcoming Pro Tour.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: center;">
	<div class="embedImagePositioner">

<p>Currently, Team Handshake consists of a lineup with familiar and fresh faces for the team:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Simon Nielsen</li>
	<li>Jonny Guttman</li>
	<li>David Inglis</li>
	<li>Zachary Kiihne</li>
	<li>Matti Kuisma</li>
	<li>Tristan Wylde-Larue</li>
	<li>Karl Sarap</li>
	<li>Julian Wellman</li>
	<li>Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa</li>
	<li>Arne Huschenbeth</li>
	<li>Javier Dominguez</li>
	<li>Reigning <em>Magic</em> World Champion, Nathan Steuer</li>
</ul>

<p>Former World Champions Javier Dominguez and Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa, the latter also a Hall of Famer, are among those to join an already strong team—combining a mixture of <i>Magic</i>'s old guard and current competitors. Team Handshake formed in early 2020 as a bunch of ragtag <i>Magic Online</i> grinders (formerly called Team Swan MTG), and with the focus on digital play in the years since they kindled a competitive spark that took them to outstanding success at numerous Championships and <i>Magic</i> World Championship XXVIII.</p>

<p>"We jokingly call ourselves Team 50%: we were 50% of the Top 8 and Top 16 at the <a href="https://magic.gg/events/new-capenna-championship" target="_blank">New Capenna Championship</a>, and 50% of the Top 4 and Top 8 at World Championship XXVIII. That will be a tough feat to match, but hitting 50% again is the goal for Pro Tour Phyrexia," explained David "Tangrams" Inglis, a World Championship XXVIII competitor. "There's little left to prove at this point as we crushed all three Championships last year, and Nathan (Steuer) won Worlds. I think most of us see this Pro Tour as more of a victory lap—a chance for us to finally meet in person for the first time."</p>

<p>After meeting through <i>Magic Online</i> and testing numerous Discord servers, Team Handshake will make their in-person connection at Pro Tour Phyrexia, with those first few having kicked it off at the World Championships XXVIII in Las Vegas. "The Gathering" is one of the most crucial and memorable aspects of <i>Magic</i>, where the team will look forward to testing and spending time as a collective.</p>

<p>"Getting to travel again for <i>Magic</i> is a real treat, and as this is my first in-person Pro Tour and first high-level tabletop event, I am excited about this experience," said Jonny "Ginky" Guttman, <a href="https://magic.gg/events/neon-dynasty-championship" target="_blank">Neon Dynasty Championship</a> Top 8 finisher. "Meeting players I have tested with for years but still have not met in person—while spending a full week in a team house testing all day every day—is my ideal way to spend a week. I really love playing high-level <i>Magic</i>, and this tournament will be a collection of the world's best players for me to prove to myself how good I am at <i>Magic</i>. I can't ask for much more than that."</p>

<p>Some of Team Handshake met in person for the first time at World Championship XXVIII last year, but as the tournament consisted of 32 players not everyone on Team Handshake was invited, making Pro Tour Phyrexia and their duration in Philadelphia an experience they relish.</p>

<p>One challenge Team Handshake faces is transferring their online success to tabletop <i>Magic</i>, where Pro Tour Phyrexia offers an in-person competitive experience for the first time in three years. In terms of testing, using <i>Magic Online</i> and <i>MTG Arena</i> offers the highest density as you can squeeze in more practice time. "Playing online <i>Magic</i> all the time is better for improvement than playing a lot of tabletop <i>Magic</i> by a wide margin," Guttman stated. "You play more games against tougher competition more often, and as someone who was a borderline casual player at the beginning of the pandemic—and learned everything I know from online play—I am very excited to crush some 'Paper Boomers' who don't know what a online Championship was in Philadelphia."</p>

<p>Inglis agreed, appreciating the ability to play more games of Magic digitally without worrying about external factors. "There are no judge calls, no triggers to remember, and no glancing up at the clock when my opponent takes a slow turn. I get to focus entirely on the game itself and think about deeper strategic elements, like trying to deduce what's in my opponent's hand. I've had the chance to improve those more nuanced skills over the last few years of digital <i>Magic</i>, and I'm hoping to retain that even with all the extra distractions of paper <i>Magic</i> for Pro Tour Phyrexia." That isn't to say Inglis was without tabletop play experience. "The last time I played a paper tournament I had <auto-card>Oko, Thief of Crowns</auto-card> in my deck."</p>

<p>(Oko was <i>the</i> dominant card at Mythic Championship VI in Novmeber 2019.)</p>

<p>With World Championship XXVIII, Team Handshake shuffled into smaller testing teams to ensure the field remained exciting but with Pro Tour Phyrexia they are together as one, intending to qualify as many members as they can for the next Pro Tour in Minneapolis. "One of my favorite parts of competitive <i>Magic</i> has always been getting to play with and against the best in the world, and I really hope that most of Team Handshake can stay qualified for a while so we can keep playing together," said Guttman. Playing against <i>Magic</i>'s competitive best is one thing but achieving this with the support of your own gathering takes it to another level, forging relationships that will last for a lifetime.</p>

<p>While it appears effortless to simply focus on Pro Tour Phyrexia and maintain playing <i>Magic</i> at the highest level, some members of Team Handshake have a unique objective in mind. "The number one goal I have for this Pro Tour is to teach the old people on my team my jokes. Javier (Dominguez) and Paulo (Vitor Damo da Rosa) both don't ever understand what I am saying, so hopefully, after spending infinite time with them in Philadelphia, they will finally understand me. Clearly, there is a direct correlation between being a World Champion and being out of touch with the youth," teased Guttman.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/5nme3ZUBTNmxClLWNqSTRS/154eaaeeaee20a2290f14b17dc8690e0/725x320-pvddr-discord-screenshot.jpg" /></div></div><br />

<p>Perhaps Pro Tour Phyrexia will mark the the younger generation of <i>Magic</i> players furthering their domination into tabletop play, defeating some of <i>Magic</i>'s most elite players such as Reid Duke, Luis Scott-Vargas, and Gabriel Nassif across these Pro Tours. Team Handshake's authority in digital <i>Magic</i> tournaments is nothing short of incredible—but Friday at Pro Tour Phyrexia starts a new journey.

From the trudge that was sometimes online remote tournaments, <i>Arena</i> Championships, <i>Magic Online</i> Champions Showcase, to the extravaganza that was <i>Magic</i> 30 in Las Vegas that played host to the World Championship... it's been a busy few years for Steuer, and there's very little he hasn't done yet in <i>Magic</i>.</p>

<p>Until now.</p>

<p>The Pro Tour is back, with play kicking off on Friday at <a href="https://mcphiladelphia.mtgfestivals.com/en-us.html" target="_blank">MagicCon: Philadelphia</a>, where several hundred players are gathered to compete in <a href="https://magic.gg/events/pro-tour-phyrexia" target="_blank">Pro Tour Phyrexia</a>, "compleating" a return four years in the making. And with the return of paper Pro Tour proper, Steuer finds himself in a paradoxical position: he's the reigning World Champ, and he's learning as he goes.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/2qJl1Mk4slPrwkXo4lEkkb/e3444572feeb114a6a52d5a26a49546c/1920x1280-Nathan-Steuer-MWCXXVIII-Holding-Trophy.jpg" /><p class="embedImageCaption">Nathan Steuer, Magic World Champion</p></div></div><br />

<p>"This has been a lot of first-time experiences for me," he said of the weeks of prep leading up to the tournament. "I've never done the big Pro Tour testing house before now. During the online era, there was really no reason to meet up so I've never gotten to experience it even thought it was something I always wanted to do.</p>

<p>"So beyond the tournament itself, it's really exciting to get everyone together and doing the whole thing."</p>

<p>And for his first tabletop Pro Tour experience, Steuer isn't holding back—the squad (Team Handshake) numbers 16 strong and has rented out what they've described as "a mansion" to accommodate the massive team.</p>

<h1>The Draft House</h1>

<p>The "testing house" is a Pro Tour tradition that we talk a lot about for a few reasons. First, it tends to be what stands out the most to any competitor who doesn't end up making the Top 8. It's good friends, food and frantic fiddling with sideboards. It's what sticks with a lot of players in the years after the memories of the matches fade. It's a feel-good story for us to cover, and it's where the camaraderie of the Pro Tour experience is cemented.</p>

<p>Of course, there's the obvious (and intended) benefit of testing against other high-level players: The average match in the Team Handshake testing house looks little like the queues on <i>MTG Arena</i>. Certain "truths" like matchup advantages that can disintegrate after six days of <i>just</i> the best players in the world working to solve the questions the format poses. One of the best ways to get better is to play against someone better than you, and for many of these players it takes a Pro Tour testing team and a week of isolation to make that happen.</p>

<p>But all of this also serves a far more practical purpose, and one that every team I've talked to is laser-focused on heading into Pro Tour week.</p>

<p>"All 16 people on our team were here by Monday, and the plan was to bring all the booster boxes we could and get used to drafting in person," Steuer explained. "I was only able to do two drafts after the set released before we got here. A lot of our emphasis is on Limited, identifying the good cards and archetypes. It's been a long time since any of us have done that at a competitive event, and we wanted to be able to have unlimited Draft meetings to prepare."</p>

<h1>The Teams</h1>

<p>That's been the refrain from player after player. The importance of the team aspect—even if some of it fades once the actual winner-takes-all tournament kicks off—is tantamount to finding continued success at the Pro Tour. Draft is the key to separating yourself from the field. And nothing can match the experience of grinding drafts against other Pro Tour competitors and comparing notes as you go.</p>

<p>"My Pioneer deck was basically locked, and I'm spending most of my time focusing on Draft. It's definitely the area I have the most room to improve in; I only have two sanctioned Limited events lifetime, 1-2 drops at Grand Prix in 2016," explained first-time Pro Tour competitor Nick Schirillo, who is working with a team led by former <i>Magic</i> Pro League member Gavin "Alphafrog" Thompson. "Getting up to speed there is going to be hard, but there's a lot of experience on my team to draw from, so I'm cautiously optimistic. That being said, testing with such high-caliber players has made me internalize how the best players of all time only win 60% of their matches at the highest level. Finding edges in such a tough field is difficult."</p>

<p>That's putting it lightly, and that's why teams have traditionally looked to Draft. With three rounds of <i>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</i> Draft leading Pro Tour Phyrexia, having the best in-house drafting team can be the difference between Day 1 and Day 2, between the Top 8 and missing the cut. While Thompson is leading a squad testing from across a handful of time zones, the superteam Team Handshake is leaning on the strength of their in-person preparation.</p>

<p>With good reason. The roster includes some of the biggest names of the past five years: champions up and down the list including two other World Champs: Javier Dominguez and Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa. It's one of the best examples of new and old-school competitors coming together in testing teams that look very different than what we saw the last time the Pro Tour was around.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/1IND5E1BnpFAC1qiZjdcSf/8e83ad285388e46bbcc053a919ce3481/281x225-2021-MPL-Javier-Dominguez-Front.png" style="margin: 3px;" /><p class="embedImageCaption">Javier Dominguez</p></div><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/j2uboh5gXasYJYUau8vLF/10810bd4e0dc27fa5fae5db58adaeb90/281x225-2021-MPL-Paulo-Vitor-Da-Rosa-Front.png" style="margin: 3px;" /><p class="embedImageCaption">Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa</p></div></div><br />

<p>For Dominguez, who earned success in a Hall of Fame career both online and through tabletop play, he recognized how important it was to get on solid footing with the return of the Pro Tour, and he was drawn to the squad that has consistently put up results over the past year. Where the future of the PT goes from here won't look like its past, and the relaunch of the circuit has the <a href="https://www.magic.gg/news/a-champions-mythic-victory-javier-dominguez" target="_blank">fire burning again in the champ.</a></p>

<p>"We've tested some online, and then we're all going to a testing house," Dominguez elaborated. "We've worked together before, and they really are a super strong team. I really don't know what to expect out of this Pro Tour, and in a way that's quite exciting."</p>

<p>Handshake isn't the only superteam gathering before the tournament, and they aren't the only group that can credibly lay claim to the title of "superteam."</p>

<p>Before there was Team Handshake, World Champion Nathan Steuer and the need for a <a href="https://www.magic.gg/news/the-week-that-was-the-zoomers-guide-to-pro-tour-phyrexia" target="_blank">Zoomer's Guide to Pro Tour Phyrexia</a>, there was Team Channel Fireball. And they are back, in full force. If Handshake represents the intersection of new and old playgroups, then <a href="https://strategy.channelfireball.com/all-strategy/home/introducing-team-cfbultimateguard-for-2023/" target="_blank">Team CFBUltimateGuard</a> is the old guard aiming to remind the <i>Magic</i> world that they haven't gone anywhere.</p>

<p>Luis Scott-Vargas. Reid Duke. Seth Manfield. Mike Sigrist. Andrew Cuneo. Martin Jůza. Raphaël Lévy.</p>

<p>I could go on, but you get the idea—these are the best of the best in the game's history, and we'll find out very soon if they've still got it. Personal prediction? These guys can still game, and we're going to have some really fun matches down the stretch involving players from both teams.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/1ir7X3sI88O25t0oZhGYQc/a443d1b7c9a4b6ea6739fe57157b6e9f/281x225-2021-Rivals-Profile-Eli-Kassis-Front.png" /><p class="embedImageCaption">Eli Kassis</p></div></div><br />

<p>"I'm working with Team CFB again. We got in a full week before the event and went to work on the new set, drafting and learning if it changed anything in Pioneer," explained Eli Kassis, the runner-up to Steuer at last year's World Championship. "Being back at the Pro Tour and working with this team means another chance at glory, fame, and camaraderie. This team is full of legends for a reason."</p>

<p>And while we're talking superteams, we must look toward another squad bringing World Champions to the field: the Japanese superteam featuring Yuta Takahashi, Shuhei Nakamura, Yuuki Ichikawa, Riku Kumagai, Yoshihiko Ikawa and many more. They're one of at least two teams from Japan working together to prep for <i>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</i> Limited, with Hismamichi Yoshigoe, Yo Akaike and Noriyuki Mori helping to lead another unit. And former champ Autumn Burchett is back and helping to lead the team Sanctum of All, which also includes notables like Chris Botelho, Rei Zhang and Violet Davies.</p>

<p>Any of these teams are poised to make a march through to Top 8 appearances.</p>

<p>Those of us in the coverage world have been doing little else but looking forward to this Pro Tour ever since the curtain closed on <i>Magic</i> World Championship XXVIII, and like many players we wondered what the return of tabletop play might mean. Discord has become a way of life for many competitors over the last three years, and careers have been created and made without ever ripping open a booster pack of <i>Magic</i> cards and shuffling to the back to see if you opened a bomb rare for your draft.</p>

<p>In the age of big data and <i>MTG Arena</i>, would the preparation change from the last time we saw Pro Tour play?</p>

<p>The answer, it seems to be, is not <i>too</i> much. We're seeing most of the field team up and most are devoting at least some time to in-person playtesting. Other large teams include the French contingent led by Jean-Emmanuel Depraz, who gained a reputation over the last few years as one of the best technical players in the game. With the transition to tabletop play he's joined a draft pod of a team that includes standouts Théau Méry and Matthieu Avignon. We're only scratching the surface—these are just a few of the dozens of Pro Tour teams are doing the same thing: draft, draft, <i>draft</i>.</p>

<p>They plan for their work to pay off this Friday when it all becomes real and the Pro Tour returns in fitting fashion: a draft. <i>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</i> is the battlefield, and hundreds of players are ready to put their hard work to the test.</p>

<p>You can watch it all live. Coverage begins Friday, February 17 at <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/magic" target="_blank">twitch.tv/magic</a>!</p>

<h1>How Will the Tournament Play Out?</h1>

<p>Pro Tour Phyrexia features two formats across three days of play, beginning with <i>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</i> Draft followed by Pioneer Constructed on each of the first two days, then a Top 8 single-elimination playoff featuring Pioneer Constructed on the final day.</p>

<p>Day One, Friday February 17:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Rounds 1–3: <i>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</i> Draft</li>
	<li>Rounds 4–8: Pioneer Constructed</li>
</ul>

<p>Day Two, Saturday February 18:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Rounds 9–11: <i>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</i> Draft</li>
	<li>Rounds 12–16: Pioneer Constructed</li>
</ul>

<p>As players earn their 12th match win, they will automatically advance to the Top 8 playoff. Final standings at the end of Round 16 will determine any remaining Top 8 slots available after all players with 12 wins have advanced—and any ties for a Top 8 slot will be determined by final standings after 16 rounds.</p>

<p>Day Three, Sunday February 19:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The Top 8 single-elimination playoff will feature Pioneer Constructed.</li>
	<li>All playoff matches, including the finals, will be Best-of-Five games. The first two games of the match will be played without competitors using sideboard cards.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <i>Magic</i> World Champion hasn't done this in a while. It's the Thursday before the kickoff of Pro Tour Phyrexia, and he's just been handed three packs of draft boosters of <i>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</i>, along with some other player gifts. He finds his friends and teammates he's holed up with for the past week grinding Draft and Pioneer games alike, until their fingers were sore from shuffling. (At least there was no Yorion.)</p>

<p>If it hasn't set in yet, it will by the time the timer kicks off on Round 1 Friday morning. Nathan Steuer is the reigning <i>Magic</i> World Champion, and this looks nothing like the way he's won tournaments for the past two meteoric years of his career.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/2qJl1Mk4slPrwkXo4lEkkb/e3444572feeb114a6a52d5a26a49546c/1920x1280-Nathan-Steuer-MWCXXVIII-Holding-Trophy.jpg" /><p class="embedImageCaption">Nathan Steuer, Magic World Champion</p></div></div><br />

<p>When Steuer capped the perfect year four months ago at <i>Magic</i> World Championship XXVIII, defeating <a href="https://magic.gg/events/magic-world-championship-xxviii" target="_blank">Eli Kassis in the finals to claim the title,</a> it was the culmination of a <i>Magic</i> career a decade in the making for one of the <a href="https://magic.gg/news/the-week-that-was-the-greatest-steuer-ever-told" target="_blank">youngest World Champion in the game's 30-year history</a>.</p>

<p>It was also played entirely on <i>Arena</i>, which felt natural to the two-time <i>Magic Online</i> Champions Showcase. His career truly took off in the online era of competitive play, and he established a mastery of everything that came along with playing for the World Championship that way.</p>

<p>But when Pro Tour Phyrexia kicks off on Friday, Feb. 17 at <a href="https://mcphiladelphia.mtgfestivals.com/content/sitebuilder/rna/mtg-festivals/global/en-us/magiccon-news/magiccon-philadelphia-the-lineup.html" target="_blank">MagicCon: Philadelphia</a>, it will be a wholly different experience for Steuer and the rest of the 100-plus competitors in the field. That field—stuffed full of talented players who performed well in 2022 and the <a href="https://magic.gg/news/the-week-that-was-regional-championships-rise" target="_blank">Regional Championships</a> held across the world over—is a mix of the best <i>Magic</i> players to rise in the digital era, fresh faces, and returning contenders dipping their toes back into this level of competition as the Pro Tour rises in glorious fashion. I have no idea how the tournament will play out for the reigning World Champion, but I have a pretty good idea of the kind of road he might face in this return of the Pro Tour: I've scoured the <a href="https://magic.gg/events/pro-tour-phyrexia-invitation-list" target="_blank">qualification list</a> and begun to imagine what the momentous weekend might look like.</p>

<p>There's going to be a heavy sense of tradition in the air. With the tumult of the last half-decade or so, the desire to celebrate The Gathering is going to permeate that Thursday players meeting when teams try to squeeze in a few furious last-minute drafts before the big moment comes Friday: they'll walk to a table, look at three booster packs in front of them, "pick a card and pass to your left." Flanked by cameras and tournament staff (that's me!) trying their best to follow the minds of the best at work, it's an intense moment as the head judge welcomes in the Pro Tour field and things officially get rolling. It's certainly a much different scene than playing in pajamas at home, or even sitting silently across two computer screens from your opponent.</p>

<p>Make no mistake—Steuer is perfectly comfortable here. He was winning Friday Night <i>Magic</i> before he was driving and making Day 2 of Grands Prix by the time he was eligible for a permit. He may have won the World Championship on <i>Arena</i>, but Steuer put in his reps shuffling sixty even when his hands were barely big enough to do so. (Again looking at you, Yorion.)</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/6taCpZS4HHxMU3VobJqnql/8bd3b355d7d6968639d79e65b8cd5c46/1920x1280-Nathan-Steuer-Day-2-Grand-Prix-San-Diego-2015.jpg" /><p class="embedImageCaption">Nathan Steuer, Grand Prix San Digeo 2015</p></div></div><br />

<p>Still, at 20 years when he won the World Championship, Steuer is one of the youngest to ever accomplish the feat—Magic household names and Hall of Famers have spent decades chasing the same—and that means that there was already a decade of Pro Tours before he was even <i>born</i>. That's a lot of history, and you couldn't blame Steuer or anyone else for not recognizing everyone in every round. There's a big difference between squaring off against someone online and carrying on conversations around the draft table and in between rounds. In that way, the Pro Tour has always been a fascinating fishbowl into how some very dedicated players handle not just the sideboard plans, but the pressure of the moment. It separates the good from the great, the Store Champions from the Hall of Famers, and, well, everyone else around from the likes of Paulo Vitor Damo Da Rosa.</p>

<p>Back to our hypothetical Round 1 here. Things might start benign enough for Steuer as he begins his draft rounds against an up-and-coming player who broke through at the Regional Championship. But Round 2 is a name you can't miss: Paul Rietzl.</p>

<p>It's been four years since the last time Rietzl's name appeared near the headlines (when he put up a Top 8 at Grand Prix Phoenix in 2019) but there aren't many Pro Tour Hall of Famers you can forget about—especially when they're the guy who somehow played and made the Top 8 both a Pro Tour <i>and</i> Grand Prix <i>on the same weekend</i>. There are rare times in sports where rules are named after the player who proved that there <i>needed</i> to be a rule, and I'm pretty sure it's fair enough to say that the informal Rietzl Rule means we won't see anyone attempt anything quite so extreme again. (Plus, Rietzl is also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09HMnBj8fP0" target="_blank">quite the sportsman to play against</a>.)</p>

<p>Steuer is the World Champion; Rietzl made his first Top 8 at a Grand Prix the year Steuer was born.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/1zTKG3C4yHgjh8COVg8KZY/030887cf6fe8e6f6ddfbf520f7bc6a16/1920x1080-DMU-Phoenix-Chick.jpg" /></div></div><br />

<p>In our fictional tournament, let's say our hero slips by the Hall of Famer in Round 2. He drops the next round to finish the draft a respectable 2-1, setting himself up for a shot to make a run through Pioneer to angle for position.</p>

<p>Steuer has played in the World Championship. He knows what it's like to play against tough opponents round after round. But even that experience can't prepare him for exactly what comes a few rounds later: a match against friend and <a href="https://magic.gg/news/the-week-that-was-rolph-champion" target="_blank">friendly rival Sam Rolph</a>. After all, there's one thing every competitive <i>Magic</i> player knows is a cruel truth of Swiss pairings: no matter how large the field, you always end up paired against someone you came to the event with.</p>

<p>Things have to get easier from there, right? Not at this tournament. Steuer's last round of the day comes down to a key Pioneer matchup. Can he defeat his last-round opponent piloting a Black midrange deck? Maybe it's Rakdos Midrange, or Abzan Greasefang. He's tested this matchup ad nauseam for the past month. Knows exactly what the matchup comes down to, and how to out-maneuver most players in the grindy games.</p>

<p>Except his opponent this round is another of the half-dozen or so Hall of Famers attending this event: Will Edel, a true master of the archetype. Not only does Edel have multiple Top 8 appearances on his resume with the archetype, but he's always playing the best version of it.</p>

<p>Steuer has practiced this matchup; Edel has lived it, in tournament after tournament, format after format, for the 20-plus years of his Hall of Fame career. He was learning the ins and outs since Steuer was learning to walk, and made his own debut by making the finals of Brazilian Nationals in 2005. When Steuer made his first Grand Prix Day in 2015, Edel was inducted into the Hall of Fame with the note "Known for his affinity for midrange decks like Jund and Abzan."</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/3oW9lp2WAA1zlCaKIkODCW/421a4eaa9521c17eca104cccf70e6e60/1920x1080-NEO-Greasefang-Okiba-Boss.jpg" /></div></div><br />

<p>But Steuer isn't the World Champion for nothing. He dispatches the legend in three anxious games to close Day 1 on a high note. Because our champ is a responsible phenom, he heads to bed early and rests up for the draft in the morning. And when he sees the names at his Day 2 Draft table, he's glad he did. Marcio Carvalho… Ben Stark… Jim Davis… Joe Lossett… Sam Pardee… Martin Juza… and Yuta Takahashi. That's one of the toughest draft tables ever assembled—and that's always the case among the top tables on Day 2 of the Pro Tour.</p>

<p>This draft is unlike any you've at home. It's nearly a completely different game than what the rest of us do at FNM. These players don't see cards—they see decks from the first card of the first pack, and frankly their picks sometimes baffle the rest of us. But this is the result of hundreds of drafts of practice and days of learning the intricacies of the format—this draft table isn't seeing the game in the same way we are, and that's why one of these competitors will have a shot to make a Top 8 run after this.</p>

<p>But only one. And, quite conveniently for our hypothetical tournament here, that someone is World Champion Nathan Steuer. Aided by the mother of machines herself, Elesh Norn makes a clutch appearance in the final round to secure the 3-0 and send Steuer into the Pioneer rounds with momentum, where he continues to pick up wins and put himself into a win-and-in for the Top 8.</p>

<p>And who might await young Nathan Steuer in that final round? Perhaps a legendary player such as Shota Yasooka or Luis Scott-Vargas.</p>

<p><em>Hall of Famers</em>.</p>

<p>The Hall of Fame membership secures our game's legends one Pro Tour invitation a year, and it's likely someone as storied as Yasooka or Vitor Damo da Rosa made the most of their play this deep into the tournament.</p>

<p>And now one of competitive <i>Magic</i>'s<i></i> greatest is seated opposite of its latest. The reigning World Champion, and someone that may have held the same title. It's the ultimate match, and one that only the return of the Pro Tour could bring us. And we get to watch it all.</p>

<p>The Pro Tour <a href="https://magic.gg/events/pro-tour-phyrexia" target="_blank">begins in just 14 days</a>. History is already underway.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>The Week That Was: Pro Tour Paths Paved Through Pioneer</title><link>https://magic.gg/news/the-week-that-was-pro-tour-paths-paved-through-pioneer</link><guid>https://magic.gg/news/the-week-that-was-pro-tour-paths-paved-through-pioneer</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>The nervous buzz—or maybe more accurately the nervous <i>silence</i>—permeates the room before the start of a big <i>Magic</i> tournament. You can almost see the hope of hundreds of players all eyeing the same trophy, and you know that in just a few short minutes battlefields will be joined (and an hour after that you're going to have half of the room stand up disappointed). But for those glorious few moments when everyone is gathered before they shuffle up, everyone is on the same page: feeling good, if more than a little nervous.</p>

<p>No amount of tournament play gets rid of those jitters. At least not entirely. Even the best in the game—world champions like Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa and Javier Dominguez—have talked about how those nerves come back at the beginning of every tournament, and with <a href="https://magic.gg/events/pro-tour-phyrexia" target="_blank">Pro Tour Phyrexia</a> kicking off a week from now on February 17 at <a href="https://mcphiladelphia.mtgfestivals.com/content/sitebuilder/rna/mtg-festivals/global/en-us/magiccon-news/magiccon-philadelphia-the-lineup.html" target="_blank">MagicCon: Philadelphia</a> it won't be long until we have a new room of renewed Pro Tour dreams.</p>

<p>And in every one of those faces, a story. Many are familiar to longtime Pro Tour viewers—the mainstays, the content creators, the faces of the game. But many more are unknown, no less fantastic for their lack of familiarity. And the beauty of the Pro Tour is that any one of those stories may belong to our eventual winner.</p>

<p>And some stories are truly wonderful. Take, for example, Alejandro Sepúlveda—who came from a small community of <i>Magic</i> players on the strength of a country of competitors working together and his favorite Pioneer deck (that he began tinkering with the moment the Regional Championships were announced) to <a href="https://magic.gg/news/alejandro-sepulveda-reigns-supreme-at-south-america-magic-series-santiago" target="_blank">win the South American Regional Championship</a>, despite being part of the half of the field that leaves Round 1 bitterly disappointed.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/2efc936WtJWIKDqXyWZSHu/3b2062cfa22f7caf63f3165a3d3a0925/1920x1080-South-America-Magic-Series-Trophy.jpg" /></div></div><br/>

<p>"At the Regional Championship, I started out losing the very first round. So from that point on, basically every round a must-win for me," he recalled.</p>

<p>Most of the time, an 0-1 start leads quickly to the lunch bracket, and you're out of the tournament in a few hours and off to find something to eat that isn't convention center fare. But rarely, it's something much more—and that's where the best stories lay. Former <i>Magic</i> World Championship Yuta Takahashi is proof enough of that. His incredible run to the 2021 Worlds title began with not just a bumpy track but a full-on train wreck—and yet he was able to turn around his disastrous 0-3 start to a perfect 7-0 run afterward and a Top 4 berth, where his <a href="https://magic.gg/news/when-dragons-fly-like-faeries" target="_blank">Dragons flew like Faeries to carry him to victory</a>.</p>

<p>Well, if it's good enough for a World Champion.</p>

<p>"I proceeded to make it to the Top 8 by winning seven rounds in a row, including beating the boogeyman of the format Rakdos Midrange three times," Sepúlveda continued. "I know there might be better decks in the format, but I played the best deck for me."</p>

<p>That deck? "Red Deck Wins" (an aggressive red deck) is a far cry from the most popular brews in the Pioneer format. But it fit Sepúlveda's playstyle, and it was what had qualified him for the Regional Championship in the first place. It was an unconventional choice for an unconventional path to victory, but at the Pro Tour they don't ask you <i>how</i> you won; they ask you <i>if</i> you won. And something that has been true across the field of 100-plus competitors is this: each of them got there their own way. For Sepúlveda, that meant going with his gut—and then trusting in it when things went wrong.</p>

<p>"Pioneer is my favorite format. I got into it when it was announced and it's super popular in my country. I enjoy putting my own touch on the decks I play, usually a random card that might look weird but makes perfect sense when you see it in play," he explained. "This was the best deck for me because I was fully aware of the lines and the matchups, and the <auto-card>Rampaging Ferocidon</auto-card> I played as a four-of in the maindeck was a crucial decision.</p>

<p>"Winning the tournament felt awesome. It's my greatest <i>Magic</i> achievement to date and I really hope it's the stepping stone I need to post more great tournament finishes in this return to competitive paper play. I'm working with Team Dominus for the Pro Tour, and the Chilean competitive community has been very helpful, especially when teaching me to play decks I don't have a lot of experience with."</p>

<p>Sepúlveda's qualification story begins with that community in Chile, and his friends back home will be close to his heart when play kicks off in Philadelphia.</p>

<p>Michael Letsch's story begins in a bowling alley.</p>

<p>"I started playing when <i>The Dark</i> came out, and a card store happened to open up at the local bowling alley, where my and my friends played in the kids bowling league on Saturdays," the self-described "two-time Friday Night <i>Magic</i> winner" recalled. "The guy who owned the pro shop also owned the card store, so that's where we would go after league days at the bowling alley. When <i>Invasion</i> came out, that set hooked me for like and I started playing PTQs and Grand Prix. I've been trying to make the Pro Tour ever since."</p>

<p>Fast forward a few decades and a <i>lot</i> of back-to-back League games (bowling, then <i>Magic)</i>, and Letsch has come a long way—but he's still rolling strikes. How else to describe his called shot at the United States' Regional Championship in Atlanta, where he arrived armed with an innovative Green-White Auras brew that featured some <i>very</i> good matchups… and some <i>very</i> bad ones.</p>

<p>"I worked with my friends from Tampa—Ryan, Ryan, Brennan, Dakota, and Ricky—for the Regional Championship. From my experience, I'm usually the beatdown player of the group. I enjoy combat math and putting my opponent to the test to have the answers," he explained. "So I leaned on my experience playing beatdown decks and rolled the dice on getting good matchups."</p>

<p>It worked. Letsch finished 7-2 with the brew, qualifying for the Pro Tour after 28 years and demonstrating that the format once thought solved <a href="https://www.magic.gg/news/metagame-mentor-pioneer-at-the-emea-us-and-brazilian-regional-championships" target="_blank">still had plenty of room for innovation</a>.</p>

===decklistId:Selesnya_Auras_Michael_Letsch___ea26c9f8-14a0-4176-bd87-d37f60005e8e===

<p>And there's one more fork in Letch's path to the Pro Tour, one that will be on all of our minds when Round 4 begins and we turn from <i>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</i> Draft to Pioneer.</p>

<p>"We knew Mono-Green Devotion was going to be the most popular deck at the event, and I thought Auras was the go-to to beat it. We were right—and I played against Mono-Green seven times in 12 rounds," he marveled. "Day 2 was pretty wild: I played against Mono-Green every single round before the Top 8. I was on the draw against all of them, and I won my matches pretty easily each time. It felt a little surreal."</p>

<p>Letsch expects the Pro Tour Phyrexia metagame to look quite a bit different than that Regional Championship, especially with <i>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</i> hitting the format just a week before decklists are due. But fear not—he's already deep into testing a handful of brews in the "hope that something sticks."</p>

<p>"I can't wait to play at the Pro Tour against the best in the world, at a high-level event with only a few hundred players," he reflected. "I feel like it's going to be a culture shock for me, but I'm going to do the best I can. I've always seemed to come back to <i>Magic</i>, and it isn't until this last Regionals that I finally get a chance to play on the Pro Tour. I still can't believe this will be first one."</p>

<p>Nestled within the expanse of the compleated MagicCon at the cavernous Philadelphia Convention Center, this is a heck of an introduction to the Pro Tour.</p>

<p>While Letsch was going rogue in Pioneer to carve a path to Philly, on the other side of the world a Pro Tour vet took the opposite approach to punch his ticket.</p>

<p>Miguel Castro was a rising European star before the pandemic, notching two Grand Prix Top 8 appearances and a handful of Pro Tour appearances. When events returned they brought back with them a renewed passion, and the Madrid native's team that includes two-time GP Top 8 competitor José Luis Velázquez quickly fired things back up.</p>

<p>Fast forward a few months, and now Castro and Velázquez are both joining Letsch and Sepúlveda at the Pro Tour as the world comes together to celebrate the gathering. Each took their own journey here, and for Castro that was thousands of hours perfecting his piloting of what has become one of <i>Magic</i>'s most recent classic decks: Izzet Phoenix. The <auto-card>Arclight Phoenix</auto-card> archetype persists through every competitive format in which it's legal, and it's been Castro's favorite Pioneer deck since he came back to <i>Magic</i>.</p>

<p>"After winning the Regional Championship Qualifier and playing the Regional Championship with Izzet Phoenix, I've worked so much on it that it's become my specialty and I hope I can play it at the Pro Tour," he explained. "It performed very well for me at the Regional Championship, and the finish meant a lot to me. It's my biggest <i>Magic</i> accomplishment so far, and it's given me the chance to play at the World Championship later this year. It was very special to qualify that way, surrounded by friends who cheered for me and supported me all through the tournament."</p>

<p>Next up for Castro and the rest of the Spanish contingent? A week of grinding <i>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</i> drafts in Philadelphia for final preparations, and every minute counts. The countdown is on, and the Pro Tour begins in less than a week.</p>

But what elevates the Pro Tour as the crown jewel for competitive <i>Magic</i> players, and how does one go about qualifying? In this special edition of Metagame Mentor, we'll explore the different paths to qualification and what it takes to earn your place on the Pro Tour stage.</p>

<h1>What is the Pro Tour?</h1>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/7sOL50bbpb11FBUu2BeU8h/59e3d5d08d51f67e2796ee9558bdd2d9/PTONE_1920x1080_Event_Summary.jpg" /></div></div><br/>

<p><i>Magic: The Gathering</i>'s Pro Tour is an invitation-only tournament series hosted by Wizards of the Coast, dating back to 1996. Before <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/feature/oral-history-first-pro-tour-2016-12-22" target="_blank">the advent of the Pro Tour</a>, the tournament scene was unstructured, but the Pro Tour and its system of qualifiers changed the game forever, offering players a chance to prove their skills against the best from around the world. Due to its prestige, large cash prizes, and international reach, the Pro Tour is the highest level of competitive <i>Magic</i> apart from the <i>Magic</i> World Championship.</p>

<p>For players looking to take their game to the highest level, the Pro Tour offers an opportunity to showcase their skills on a global stage with live streaming coverage. The electric atmosphere of high-stakes <i>Magic</i> at a pinnacle tabletop event is something that cannot be matched online. Winning a Pro Tour solidifies a player's status as a top competitor, and those who have claimed multiple victories, such as Jon Finkel, Kai Budde, and Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa, have cemented their place in <i>Magic</i> competition as legends of the game.</p>

<p>For over two decades, Pro Tours were held several times per year, leaving a rich history in their wake. After recent detours involving Mythic Championships, Players Tours, and Set Championships with focus on digital play, the tabletop-made <a href="https://magic.gg/news/return-of-the-pro-tour-details" target="_blank">Pro Tour is back</a>. Three Pro Tours are held per year, each offering approximately 250 qualified players the chance to compete for their share of $500,000 in prizes, invitations to the <i>Magic</i> World Championship, and the right to claim their place among the best in the world.</p>

<p>Qualifying for the Pro Tour has come a long way since the first Pro Tour in 1996, where players had to call a phone number and whoever called first got in. Now, players must prove their skills in paper or digital tournaments to earn their place. Let's take a closer look at the various paths to qualification.</p>

<h1>The Regional Championship Path: Tabletop</h1>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/DJPNxAlrmrCNwY5ZB7Fc6/a1e2363f540575f16e5741b149b2280d/1080x1080-Magic-Premier-Play-Path-2022-2023-Infographic.jpg" /></div></div><br/>

<p>The most common path to Pro Tour qualification is by performing well at Regional Championships. Regional Championships, held three times per yearly season in every geographic region, are invite-only events that players can earn entry to through various means, including <i>Magic Online</i> or Last Chance Qualifiers. But the most common way is via Regional Championship Qualifiers (RCQs) held at local stores or larger conventions. You can find RCQs around you by using the <a href="https://locator.wizards.com/search?searchType=magic-events&amp;tag=regional_championship_qualifier&amp;query=Los%20Angeles,%20CA,%20USA&amp;distance=100&amp;page=1&amp;sort=date&amp;sortDirection=asc" target="_blank">Store &amp; Event Locator</a> or <a href="https://magic.gg/pro-tour?section=regional-championships#pro-tour" target="_blank">your regional organizer's website</a>. They are open to everyone, and the players who conquer their local scene compete for Pro Tour invites and other prizes at their Regional Championships.</p>

<p>One example of a player who took this path is <a href="https://twitter.com/MiguelCastroGG" target="_blank">Miguel Castro</a>, the reigning European champion. After winning an RCQ at Tienda Itaca—"the best <i>Magic</i> store in Madrid (and Spain)" according to him—he triumphed over hundreds of players at the European Championship using the same Pioneer deck: Izzet Phoenix. Having attended Pro Tours several times before, he was excited to qualify again, and he described the return of the Pro Tour as "something really special". While he feels a bit of pressure, he's feeling better about his chances than ever before: "I feel more confident after demonstrating myself that I can compete at the high stakes."</p>

<p>Another example is <a href="https://twitter.com/SepulvedaMTG" target="_blank">Alejandro Sepulveda</a>, the reigning South American champion. He won an RCQ at MagicSur Chile and subsequently crushed the South American Championship with his favorite Pioneer deck: Mono-Red Aggro. "Competing at the Pro Tour means a lot to me", he said as he recounted his experience at Pro Tour <i>Ixalan</i> several years ago. "It was a dream come true. I had been grinding local qualifiers until I finally got there, I did terribly at the Pro Tour, but I didn't care much about that at the time." But Pro Tour Phyrexia will be different, and Sepulveda is hungry for more. "I'm working really hard to up my game and unleash the great player I know I can be. I really want to make the most of it not only because it is good for me, but also because it is good for our South American community."</p>

<p>These Regional Champions, along with over 150 other players whose Regional Championship performance was good enough to qualify, may represent their regions at the Pro Tour in the knowledge that they're cheering them on back home. For more details on this first cycle of Regional Championships, including an overview of the region-specific number of invites for Pro Tour Phyrexia and the top Pioneer decks, check out <a href="https://www.magic.gg/news/metagame-mentor-the-top-15-pioneer-decks-from-regional-championships" target="_blank">my primer</a>. More information on upcoming RCQ formats and promo cards is available <a href="https://magic.gg/news/rcq-format-updates-and-upcoming-promo-cards" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<h1>The <i>MTG Arena</i> Path: Digital</h1>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/3oHnRWtt6a7iXEMoLwJo3g/3d37d11fe952be8a7bf0e36b1aa8799f/mtg-arena-premier.jpg" /></div></div><br/>

<p>Another way to earn a Pro Tour qualification is by reaching seven wins in Day Two of a Qualifier Weekend on <i>MTG Arena</i>. To earn a spot in these monthly Qualifier Weekends, as described in more detail on <a href="https://www.magic.gg/news/mtg-arena-premier-play-policy" target="_blank"><i>MTG Arena</i> Premier Play page</a>, there are various methods: by finishing in the Top 250 of the Constructed or Limited ladder at the end of the preceding month, by reaching enough wins in Day 2 of an Arena Open, or—most commonly—via a Qualifier Play-In event.</p>

<p>Seven-win earners from Day Two of a Qualifier Weekend not only earn a Pro Tour qualification but also clinch a spot in the Arena Championship, which represents the apex of the <i>MTG Arena</i> Premier Play pyramid. To bring this thrice-yearly event to 32 competitors, remaining Arena Championship invitations are given to players with the most total Day Two match wins in contributing Qualifier Weekends. However, Pro Tour invitations are only awarded to seven-win earners.</p>

<p>One of the players who reached seven wins at the November Qualifier Weekend was <a href="https://twitter.com/MrChecklistcard" target="_blank">Simon Nielsen</a>. Although the difficulty of having to go 7-1 on both days made him initially hesitant about the effort required, he eventually realized there was a reason why Qualifier Weekends were difficult: "The payoff is through the roof. Not only is it a way to qualify directly for the Pro Tour, it also gives an invite to the Arena Championship, a tournament that's almost like a mini Worlds. With just 32 players and a huge prize pool, it certainly feels like it... I had to take them seriously, and put in an amount of preparation like I would for a Regional Championship. Outside of Regional Championships, these are some of the only events to qualify directly for the Pro Tour and should be treated as such. So for the November Historic Qualifier, Team Handshake spent a week trying out the many deck options in Historic, eventually finding the broken Goblin Trapfinder deck."</p>

<p>Nielsen was eager to return to the Pro Tour, where he has the chance to relive past victories. One of his fondest Pro Tour memories was from Pro Tour Eldritch Moon, where he achieved a new personal best that secured his spot in subsequent Pro Tours. "The feeling of joy as I won my last round was incredible. I remember Christoffer Larsen lifting me in the air in celebration", he reminisced. "Pro Tours offer this unique opportunity to really achieve something. You know that you get nothing for free; everyone tries their hardest. And if you can beat that, the payoff is immense."</p>

<h1>The <i>Magic Online</i> Path: Digital</h1>

<p>The <a href="https://www.mtgo.com/premier-play-2023" target="_blank"><i>Magic Online</i> Premier Play program</a> offers two paths to the Pro Tour, one direct and one indirect, and I've created my own flowchart to visualize this for us:</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/6ImhCQQ8bMX8qDdK7svltV/b0d3cdc4b22de3307a5ec9564570e2ef/1920x1080-Magic-Online-Premier-Play-Flowchart.png" /></div></div><br/>

<p>The indirect path involves performing well in one of the many Qualifiers or Super Qualifiers, which grant invitations to a Regional Championship. These <i>Magic Online</i> events come in a variety of formats, including Standard, Pioneer, Modern, Legacy, Vintage, Pauper, and Limited.</p>

<p>The direct path, on the other hand, is through the <i>Magic Online</i> Champions Showcase (MOCS) tournaments. Three times a year, they culminate in the eight-player Champions Showcase. To qualify, players can win an invite-only Showcase Qualifier, a Limited Showcase Open, or secure one of two at-large spots on the Leaderboard. All eight players also earn invitations to the Pro Tour.</p>

<p>One such player who earned his Pro Tour invitation through the <i>Magic Online</i> Championship Showcase is <a href="https://twitter.com/CHERRYAXEMAN_OP" target="_blank">Kiran Dhokia</a>, better known online as Cherryxman. "Whilst the Pro Tour has never been a goal of mine, it is an exciting new opportunity for me to compete at a high level," he told me. And as the Pro Tour features both Constructed and Limited formats, it presents a new challenge to Dhokia: "I am especially excited to develop my skills in Limited as I prefer Constructed, but learning formats that are new to me is very enjoyable."</p>

<p>When asked why <i>Magic Online</i> is his preferred platform, Dhokia had a clear explanation: "it's due to the great diversity of formats, decks, and the huge number of high level players online. The flexibility on offer, through leagues as well, allows for a great opportunity to practice and improve."</p>

<h1>Previous Championship Success</h1>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/Z3Sbi9athPqufjbO5j1Cl/2ef9b6c6c8f43dd402ec85f3789e12ba/1920x1080-MWC-XXVIII-Gallery-Nathan-Steuer-With-Trophy.jpg" /><p class="embedImageCaption">World Champion Nathan Steuer</p></div></div><br />

<p>Another qualification path is via top finishes at previous Pro Tours or World Championships. The <a href="https://magic.gg/news/return-of-the-pro-tour-details" target="_blank">details</a> get a bit complicated, especially given that 2022-23 is a transitional season. But one thing is clear: The Top 4 players from the 2022 World Championship (Nathan Steuer, Eli Kassis, Jakub Tóth, and Karl Sarap) are qualified for all Pro Tours this season, raising the level of competition.</p>

<p>Additionally, players who score enough match wins at a Pro Tour will automatically earn a qualification for the next one. At Pro Tour Phyrexia specifically, a 9-7 finish or better will grant an invite for Pro Tour March of the Machine. There's also an Adjusted Match Point system, which rewards players with high finishes over the previous three rolling Pro Tours, allowing solid performances to earn Pro Tour invitations as well. However, since Pro Tour Phyrexia is the first tabletop Pro Tour in years, these systems do not yet apply. Instead, all 32 players from <a href="https://magic.gg/events/magic-world-championship-xxviii" target="_blank"><i>Magic</i> World Championshi[ XXVIII</a> and players who finished 9-6 or better at the <a href="https://magic.gg/events/new-capenna-championship" target="_blank">New Capenna Championship</a> received invitations.</p>

<p>Among the New Capenna Championship qualifiers is <a href="https://twitter.com/IslandGoSAMe" target="_blank">Sam Bogue</a>, better known online as IslandGoSAMe. Bogue regards Pro Tour Phyrexia as "definitely the most important tournament of my life so far." As he explained, "it's been a dream of mine to compete at a tabletop Pro Tour ever since I started playing this game 10 years ago; I'm sure the friend group I played with in Middle School would be proud of me. I've played in various Regional events before, but never an event that brings together players from all around the world."</p>

<p>As the Pro Tour features Pioneer just one week after the release of<i> Phyrexia: All Will Be One</i>, it incentives format experts to come up with new and innovative brews. "I was very excited when I realized that this Pro Tour was Pioneer," Bogue said. "Since my Twitch and YouTube content has been Pioneer-focused for about a year now, I'm super ready to put my format knowledge and experience to the test here. Pioneer right now is one of the best formats to brew in, and <i>Phyrexia: All Will be One</i> will definitely give players a ton of new tools and strategies to work with for this event."</p>

<h1><i>Magic</i> Hall of Fame: The Legacy of Success</h1>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/1AOCC37y172zilr9WXcrLn/ee26a11175d5c0f759efc583fc0b41da/1920x1080-Pro-Tour-Hall-of-Fame.png" /></div></div><br/>

<p>The <i>Magic</i> <a href="https://www.magic.gg/hall-of-fame" target="_blank">Hall of Fame</a> enshrines the most significant and influential competitors of the game, and its members are invited to one Pro Tour per yearly season of their choice. Many Hall of Famers, including the likes of Luis Scott-Vargas, Shota Yasooka, Reid Duke, and Gabriel Nassif, are already qualified for Pro Tour Phyrexia through aforementioned qualification paths, so they don't need to use this special invite. Other Hall of Famers, however, plan to use their once-per-year invite immediately to compete at Pro Tour Phyrexia.</p>

<p>Among them is the record holder for the number of Pro Tours played—<a href="https://twitter.com/raphlevymtg" target="_blank">Raphaël Lévy</a>. With over 100 Pro Tours under his belt, he's the most experienced player in the field. For years, his life revolved around the Pro Tour, and to him it offered something truly unique: "Recognition from your peers is one of the most precious and hardest thing to achieve in any competitive activities. Being inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2006 (what seems to be a lifetime away) was a milestone in my career but also an incredible moment. Playing at the Pro Tour with the Hall of Fame tag was and still is a driving force and a source of never-ending motivation."</p>

<p>Although Lévy took great pride on his string of consistent finishes that kept him on the Pro Tour train for decades, the organized play system and his priorities have changed since his competitive heyday. Most notably, he's become the proud father of two young kids. While he remains excited to attend Pro Tour Phyrexia, Lévy's <i>Magic</i>-related goals are different from before.</p>

<p>"Consistency isn't on the menu anymore, so now I'm more interested in posting a few more flashy finishes, if I can," he said. We're looking forward to seeing if his drive and experience can propel Lévy to yet another Top 8 finish, perhaps this time with loud cheers from his family back home.</p>

<h1>Pro Tour Qualifiers: Tabletop's Fast Lane</h1>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/5ykNEa5wtQIg4vrF0wwxNp/f61b6ed34dd094a5c6c7100d5f5541f8/1920x1080-Magic-Con-Casual-Play-Event.jpg" /></div></div><br/>

<p>Pro Tour Qualifiers—not to be confused with Regional Championship Qualifiers—are the most direct way to the Pro Tour. The first of these events will be held at <a href="https://mcphiladelphia.mtgfestivals.com/en-us/tickets/buy-tickets.html" target="_blank">MagicCon: Philadelphia</a>. There's one on Friday and one on Saturday, and each will award four invitations to Pro Tour March of the Machine, taking place at MagicCon: Minneapolis on May 5–7. The format for these Pro Tour Qualifiers is <i>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</i> Limited.</p>

<p>To me, these PTQs are reminiscent of the old Grand Prix events. Although they are not held as frequently, they are open to anyone attending MagicCon: Philadelphia, held at a large convention, draw players from all around the world, and reward top performers with direct access to the Pro Tour. As an additional benefit, any Pro Tour qualification (regardless of qualification path) extends to an automatic invitation to the corresponding Regional Championship as well. Especially if you're a Limited expert, these PTQs may be perfect for you, so don't miss out on the opportunity!</p>

<h1>Pro Tours: A Part of <i>Magic</i>'s History</h1>

<p>There are several qualification paths towards the Pro Tour, ranging from tabletop tournaments to digital avenues: there surely is one that can work for you. Each winner has their name carved into competitive <i>Magic</i> history, making memories that last a lifetime.</p>

<p>We'll watch someone make their own history at Pro Tour Phyrexia, featuring <a href="https://magic.gg/news/pro-tour-phyrexia-viewers-guide" target="_blank">live streaming coverage</a> on February 17—19 with a stacked broadcast team. See you there!</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to Metagame Mentor, your weekly guide to the top decks and latest Constructed developments on the path to the Pro Tour. Today, we'll take a look at the top 15 Pioneer archetypes from the first cycle of Regional Championships and discuss what happened in these events. This can be your go-to resource to acquaint yourself with Pioneer (or Explorer) as you prepare for upcoming tournaments.</p>

<h1>The First Cycle of Regional Championships</h1>

<p>The first cycle of Regional Championships for the 2022-23 season took place in November and December of last year, inviting the best players from each region to compete for hundreds of thousands of dollars in prizes, 13 invitations to <i>Magic</i> World Championship XXIX, and 162 invitations to the <a href="https://mcphiladelphia.mtgfestivals.com/content/sitebuilder/rna/mtg-festivals/global/en-us/magiccon-news/magiccon-philadelphia-the-lineup.html" target="_blank">Pro Tour Phyrexia: All Is One</a>. These Regional Championships, held three times per year in each geographical region, are the new focal points for competitive play and offer a chance for players to qualify for the Pro Tour.</p>

<p>Over 2,900 players, mostly qualified through Regional Championship Qualifiers (RCQs) arranged by each regional organizer through local game stores, entered the various Regional Championships across the globe. They experienced the excitement of returning to in-person tournaments and high-stakes competition.</p>

<p>To provide an overview of all events, I collected their MTG Melee pages, which yield decklists, results, and standings for the Swiss rounds. For each region, the listed number of Pro Tour invites include the start-up bonus invitations that Wizards of the Coast awards for the 2022-23 season only:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Tournament/View/12649" target="_blank">U.S.A.</a> (48 Pro Tour invites)</li>
	<li><a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Tournament/View/12521" target="_blank">Europe/Middle East/Africa</a> (36 Pro Tour invites)</li>
	<li><a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Tournament/View/12349" target="_blank">Brazil</a> (8 Pro Tour invites)</li>
	<li><a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Tournament/View/11821" target="_blank">Eastern Canada</a> (8 Pro Tour invites)</li>
	<li><a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Tournament/View/12374" target="_blank">Japan/Korea</a> (18 Pro Tour invites)</li>
	<li><a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Tournament/View/12737" target="_blank">Australia/New Zealand</a> (12 Pro Tour invites)</li>
	<li><a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Tournament/View/12857" target="_blank">Southeast Asia</a> (8 Pro Tour invites)</li>
	<li><a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Tournament/View/13040" target="_blank">South America</a> (4 Pro Tour invites)</li>
	<li><a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Tournament/View/12465" target="_blank">Chinese Taipei</a> (4 Pro Tour invites)</li>
	<li><a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Tournament/View/11822" target="_blank">Western Canada</a> (8 Pro Tour invites)</li>
	<li><a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Tournament/View/12862" target="_blank">Mexico/Central America/Caribbean</a> (4 Pro Tour invites)</li>
	<li><a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Organization/View/2698" target="_blank">China</a> (8 Pro Tour invites)</li>
</ul>

<p>You can find Top 8 brackets, photos, and more in <a href="https://www.magic.gg/events/event-archive" target="_blank">our event coverage archive</a>. With more than 2,900 Regional Championship competitors in total, a lot of <auto-card>Teferi, Hero of Dominaria</auto-card> promo cards were handed out and a lot of Pioneer decklists are available to sink our teeth into. Let's crunch the numbers!</p>

<h1>The Pioneer Metagame</h1>

<p><a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/formats/pioneer" target="_blank">Pioneer</a> is a nonrotating format based on expansion sets and core sets from <i>Return to Ravnica</i> forward, and the most notable cards on <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/banned-restricted-list#pioneer-banned" target="_blank">the ban list</a> are the fetch lands. Using data from the Pioneer decklists submitted to the first cycle of 2022-23 Regional Championships, I determined the metagame share and non-mirror win rate of every archetype. While this analysis heavily weighs the results of the U.S. Regional Championship, which had an attendance of over 900 players, it accounts for developments from all regions.</p>

<p>In this table, each archetype name hyperlinks to a well-performing, representative decklist.

<p>The most-played nonland cards across all main decks and sideboards were <auto-card>Fable of the Mirror-Breaker</auto-card>, <auto-card>Bonecrusher Giant</auto-card>, <auto-card>Thoughtseize</auto-card>, <auto-card>Fatal Push</auto-card>, <auto-card>Llanowar Elves</auto-card>, and <auto-card>Elvish Mystic</auto-card>. These cards are considered staples of the format and can be found in a variety of decks.</p>

<p>The diverse metagame shows that there are many competitively viable options in Pioneer. In the hands of a skilled and experienced pilot, anything can win in Pioneer. Especially when all match win rates are close to 50-50, the pilot's familiarity with their deck and its play patterns can often be the deciding factor. As U.S. Regional Champion Matthew Saypoff pointed out, "Any deck can do well in Pioneer... so it's really a matter of picking a deck you like the play pattern of and can get really good at." South American Regional Champion Alejandro Sepúlveda echoed this sentiment, saying, "I think that experience can give me a greater edge than playing a better deck I don't know how to play."</p>

<h1>The Top 15 Pioneer Deck Archetypes</h1>

<p>To take a closer look at the 15 most popular archetypes from the Regional Championships, I've used a decklist aggregation algorithm that takes into account the popularity and performance of individual card choices. For each archetype, I've also included a matchup spread based on the Regional Championship round-by-round data, as well as tips for playing against the deck and a discussion of its viability in Explorer (the online true-to-tabletop format featuring all Pioneer-legal cards that appear on <i>MTG Arena</i>).</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Rakdos_Midrange____40ba645f-ea00-4f83-9afa-1be6f696b7e1===

<p><b>Quick deck summary:</b> Rakdos Midrange was the most popular archetype overall at the Regional Championships, comprising 17.1% of the metagame. The deck features efficient discard, powerful removal, resilient threats, and flexible sideboard options, giving it game against everything. The most important <i>Brothers' War</i> addition to Pioneer—<auto-card>Misery's Shadow</auto-card>—is included as a two-mana threat that prevents opposing death triggers and graveyard recursion.</p>

<p><b>Regional Championship story:</b> During the first weekend of Regional Championships, Rakdos Midrange was the second most popular deck, behind Mono-Green Devotion. However, as players discovered that <auto-card>Misery's Shadow</auto-card> evened the matchup against Mono-Green Devotion, Rakdos Midrange gained popularity and ended up winning as many as five Regional Championships! The victors were <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/256726" target="_blank">Pedro Mocelin</a> in Brazil, <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/258964" target="_blank">Rei Hirayama</a> in Japan, <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/258736" target="_blank">Anthony Lee</a> in Australia, <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/262184" target="_blank">Jim Tim Lee</a> in Taiwan, and <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/263093" target="_blank">Joseph Karani</a> in Western Canada. Rakdos Midrange will likely be the top deck to beat as we move towards the Pro Tour.</p>

<p><b>Matchup spread:</b> Rakdos Midrange has strong matchups against many decks, particularly those that are susceptible to removal, such as Boros Heroic and Bant Spirits. However, there are several archetypes that have a good matchup against Rakdos Midrange, including Gruul Vehicles, Keruga Fires, Rakdos Sacrifice, and Enigmatic Fires. These decks may see an increase in popularity in the coming weeks as players try to counter the dominance of Rakdos Midrange.</p>

<p><b>When facing this deck: </b>It's important to keep in mind that you should mulligan slightly less aggressively than might normally, as you'll need all the resources you can get. <auto-card>Thoughtseize</auto-card> and <auto-card>Dreadbore</auto-card> can disrupt your plans, and <auto-card>Kroxa, Titan of Death's Hunger</auto-card> can deprive you of further resources. Since you need raw cardboard, it's often better to keep a mediocre seven-card hand than a synergistic six-card hand against Rakdos Midrange.</p>

<p><b>Viability in Explorer</b>: On <i>MTG Arena</i>, <auto-card>Dreadbore</auto-card> and <auto-card>Urborg, Tomb of Yawgmoth</auto-card> are not available but they can be replaced by additional copies of <auto-card>Power Word Kill</auto-card> and a basic Swamp. As a result, Rakdos Midrange is also one of the most popular choices in Explorer.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Mono-Green_Devotion____f4d2563e-c04b-4803-bb39-d2652c01eb09===

<p><b>Quick deck summary</b>: Mono-Green Devotion, at 16.9% of the combined Regional Championship metagame, was the second-most popular archetype overall. The deck uses mana elves and <auto-card>Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx</auto-card> to potentially ramp into a turn-three <auto-card>Storm the Festival</auto-card>, which can even put <auto-card>Nicol Bolas, Dragon-God</auto-card> onto the battlefield. The inclusion of <auto-card>Karn, the Great Creator</auto-card>, along with <auto-card>The Stone Brain</auto-card>, <auto-card>Cityscape Leveler</auto-card>, and <auto-card>Haywire Mite</auto-card> from <i><auto-card>The Brothers' War</auto-card></i>, has made Mono-Green Devotion a formidable force.</p>

<p><b>Regional Championship story</b>: Mono-Green Devotion started as the most popular deck in the first Regional Championship weekend, where it helped propel <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/256119" target="_blank">Adrien Houssard</a> to a Top 8 in Europe and <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/254749" target="_blank">Eduardo Cesar</a> to a Top 8 in Brazil. However, as its overall win rate dropped below 50% and other players tuned their lists against Mono-Green Devotion, its popularity decreased in subsequent weekends. Despite this, Mono-Green Devotion remains a popular and important part of the Pioneer metagame, with players such as <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/260944" target="_blank">Christian Trudel</a> (winner of Eastern Canada Regionals), <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/260705" target="_blank">Michael van Vaals</a> (Top 8 in Eastern Canada), <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/259245" target="_blank">Shuhei Nakamura</a> (Top 8 in Japan), <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/260830" target="_blank">Dan Bretherton</a> and <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/260684" target="_blank">Daniel Riley</a> (both Top 8 in Australia), <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/263695" target="_blank">Chris Carlile</a>, and <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/263166" target="_blank">Dan Snider</a> (both Top 8 in Western Canada) finding success with the deck.</p>

<p><b>Matchup spread:</b> Mono-Green Devotion has a close matchup against Rakdos Midrange and a good matchup against decks like Rakdos Sacrifice and Keruga Fires, where it can go over the top. However, it struggles against decks with disruptive aggression, such as Mono-White Humans and Mono-Blue Spirits, which exploit its lack of creature removal and reliance on expensive spells.</p>

<p><b>When facing this deck</b>: It's important to be aware that the deck is capable of complex infinite loops. For example, <auto-card>Karn, the Great Creator</auto-card> can grab <auto-card>The Chain Veil</auto-card> and <auto-card>Pestilent Cauldron</auto-card> // <auto-card>Restorative Burst</auto-card> from the sideboard, allowing <auto-card>Kiora, Behemoth Beckoner</auto-card> to potentially untap <auto-card>Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx</auto-card> infinitely often. In tabletop events, it can be helpful to use pen and paper to track your opponent's mana pool, potential land drop for the turn, the number <auto-card>The Chain Veil</auto-card> activations, and the number of times <auto-card>Karn, the Great Creator</auto-card> and <auto-card>Kiora, Behemoth Beckoner</auto-card> have been activated, to help ensure that the game state remains clear and accurate.</p>

<p><b>Viability in Explorer</b>: On <i>MTG Arena</i>, Mono-Green Devotion lacks consistency due to the unavailability of <auto-card>Oath of Nissa</auto-card>, <auto-card>Sylvan Caryatid</auto-card>, and <auto-card>The Chain Veil</auto-card>. However, since the addition of Nykthos to Explorer via Explorer Anthology 2, Mono-Green Devotion has become one of the most popular archetypes in the format.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Izzet_Phoenix____fc28cea2-5632-47fb-b99f-937d1131d779===

<p><b>Quick deck summary</b>: Izzet Phoenix was the third most popular archetype at the Regional Championships, comprising 9.8% of the metagame. This deck aims to put multiple <auto-card>Arclight Phoenix</auto-card> into the graveyard, typically using <auto-card>Pieces of the Puzzle</auto-card> or <auto-card>Lightning Axe</auto-card>, and then recur them by chaining together three cheap spells in a single turn. Izzet Phoenix can also use <auto-card>Galvanic Iteration</auto-card> to copy <auto-card>Treasure Cruise</auto-card> or <auto-card>Temporal Trespass</auto-card>, which can be a game-winning play.</p>

<p><b>Regional Championship story</b>: Izzet Phoenix peaked in the first Regional Championship weekend, where it won the European Championship in the hands of <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/255886" target="_blank">Miguel Castro</a> and had players <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/255195" target="_blank">Ben Jones</a> and <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/256106" target="_blank">Thierry Ramboa</a> reach the Top 4. <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/255947" target="_blank">Ken Takahama</a> also made it to the finals in the U.S., and <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/255105" target="_blank">Pedro Avena</a> made Top in Brazil. However, as the metagame became more hostile to graveyard strategies and the popularity of Lotus Field combo increased, Izzet Phoenix's results and popularity declined significantly in later weekends. <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/260428" target="_blank">Andy Peters</a> still made Top 8 in Eastern Canada, but performance dropped afterwards.</p>

<p><b>Matchup spread</b>: Izzet Phoenix has strong matchups against Mono-Blue Spirits and Bant Spirits, but struggles against Lotus Field combo and Selesnya Angels. The matchups against Rakdos Midrange and Mono-Green Devotion are close to even and can be heavily influenced by specific card choices and player skill, although Rakdos Midrange may have a slight edge thanks to cards like <auto-card>Go Blank</auto-card>.</p>

<p><b>When facing this deck</b>: When playing against Izzet Phoenix, try to avoid casting spells that can be countered by <auto-card>Spell Pierce</auto-card> if possible. It's usually only a two-of, but if your opponent is conspicuously holding a blue mana open, then consider casting a noncreature spell instead. Another thing to keep in mind is that <auto-card>Ledger Shredder</auto-card> makes double-spelling less appealing, so sequence in a way that avoids granting free connive triggers.</p>

<p><b>Viability in Explorer</b>: On <i>MTG Arena</i>, Izzet Phoenix is missing key cards like <auto-card>Pieces of the Puzzle</auto-card>, <auto-card>Treasure Cruise</auto-card>, <auto-card>Temporal Trespass</auto-card>, and <auto-card>Thing in the Ice</auto-card>, which makes it difficult to build the deck in this delve-spell form.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Mono-White_Humans____49075d4a-4875-4670-9ccf-0db8cba90c55===

<p><b>Quick deck summary</b>: Mono-White Humans is a popular aggro deck that made up 7.6% of the combined metagame at the Regional Championships. It focuses on curving out with powerful Humans on turns one, two, and three, using <auto-card>Thalia's Lieutenant</auto-card> to boost them all. One advantage of staying mono-color is that it allows you to easily fit <auto-card>Mutavault</auto-card> and <auto-card>Castle Ardenvale</auto-card> into your mana base, and you can also steal games with <auto-card>Brave the Elements</auto-card>.</p>

<p><b>Regional Championship story</b>: Mono-White Humans had a strong showing at the Regional Championships, with players such as <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/256856" target="_blank">Matthew Saypoff</a> (winner of the U.S. Regional Championship), <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/259350" target="_blank">Heng Chye Hwee</a> (Top 8 in Southeast Asia), <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/258752" target="_blank">Dalia Morin</a> (Top 8 in Eastern Canada), and <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/262150" target="_blank">Shu-Yu Hsueh</a> and <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/258770" target="_blank">Josh Zhen</a> (both Top 8 in Taiwan) finding success with the deck. Mono-White Humans has a good win rate against the current metagame as a whole.</p>

<p><b>Matchup spread</b>: Mono-White Humans has a good matchup against Mono-Green Devotion, Azorius Control, and Lotus Field combo, but struggles against Gruul Vehicles, Selesnya Angels, and Rakdos Sacrifice. The matchup against Rakdos Midrange is close to even.</p>

<p><b>When facing this deck</b>: Be aware of the possibility of surprise lethal via <auto-card>Brave the Elements</auto-card>. If possible, leave blockers of different colors untapped and attack with your multicolored creatures. Colorless creatures, such as <auto-card>Mutavault</auto-card> or tokens created by <auto-card>Sokenzan, Crucible of Defiance</auto-card>, will always be able to block as well.</p>

<p><b>Viability in Explorer</b>: On <i>MTG Arena</i>, Mono-White Humans is missing <auto-card>Kytheon, Hero of Akros</auto-card> and <auto-card>Thalia, Heretic Cathar</auto-card>, but these one-ofs can be easily replaced, making Mono-White Humans a one of the most popular choices in the format.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Azorius_Control____5aff7753-3615-46d9-bb9c-2cc0d0face32===

<p><b>Quick deck summary</b>: Azorius Control, at 6.4% of the combined Regional Championship metagame, is the premier control deck in Pioneer. It includes a range of standard control elements such as spot removal, countermagic, card draw, sweepers, and planeswalkers. While 80-card builds featuring <auto-card>Yorion, Sky Nomad</auto-card> also exist, as do builds involving <auto-card>Lotus Field</auto-card> and <auto-card>Strict Proctor</auto-card>, the more traditional and consistent 60-card builds are more popular.</p>

<p><b>Regional Championship story</b>: Azorius Control had several strong finishes at the Regional Championships, with players such as <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/256011" target="_blank">Théau Méry</a> (second place in Europe), <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/254547" target="_blank">Derrick Davis</a> (Top 8 in the U.S.), <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/255410" target="_blank">Pedro Perrini</a> (Top 8 in Brazil), <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/260577" target="_blank">Michael Martin Go</a> (winner in Southeast Asia), <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/259887" target="_blank">Kazuya Kiyofuji</a> (Top 8 in Japan), and <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/265561" target="_blank">Mario Flores</a> (Top 8 in Mexico) finding success with the deck.</p>

<p><b>Matchup spread</b>: Azorius Control has a good matchup against Selesnya Angels, Keruga Fires, and Enigmatic Fires, but struggles against the more popular Mono-White Humans. The matchups against Rakdos Midrange and Mono-Green Devotion are close to even.</p>

<p><b>When facing this deck</b>: When playing against this deck, you always have to be wary of sweepers and countermagic. Try not to overextend your threats into <auto-card>Supreme Verdict</auto-card> or <auto-card>Temporary Lockdown</auto-card>, and consider playing a cheaper but worse spell to play around <auto-card>Censor</auto-card> or <auto-card>Make Disappear</auto-card>.</p>

<p><b>Viability in Explorer</b>: In Explorer, Azorius Control is fully legal and is one of the most popular choices in the format.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Gruul_Vehicles____5082f45a-f453-4ab6-a9ed-a2e3e086a46a===

<p><b>Quick deck summary</b>: Gruul Vehicles is a midrange deck that uses <auto-card>Llanowar Elves</auto-card> or <auto-card>Elvish Mystic</auto-card> to ramp into <auto-card>Reckless Stormseeker</auto-card> on turn two. The Werewolf can grant haste to <auto-card>Esika's Chariot</auto-card> or <auto-card>Skysovereign, Consul Flagship</auto-card>, allowing Gruul Vehicles to dominate the battlefield quickly.<i> </i>The vehicles also allow you to tap a stolen creature in response to the third chapter of <auto-card>The Akroan War</auto-card>.</p>

<p><b>Regional Championship story</b>: The archetype did particularly well in Canada, as <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/260641" target="_blank">Noe Offman</a> made Top 8 in Toronto and <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/263699" target="_blank">Violet Davies</a> made Top 8 in Calgary. Violet Davies played a non-Jegantha version featuring <auto-card>Werewolf Pack Leader</auto-card>, which can be a viable alternative in metagames where speed is of the essence. Regardless of the specific build, Gruul Vehicles had a strong win rate throughout the Regional Championships.</p>

<p><b>Matchup spread</b>: Gruul Vehicles is well-positioned in the current metagame, with good matchups against Rakdos Midrange and Mono-White Humans. It struggles against Enigmatic Fires, Rakdos Sacrifice, and Selesnya Angels, which are not seeing much play. The matchup against Mono-Green Devotion is close to even.</p>

<p><b>When facing this deck</b>: Keep a close eye on their companion. If they don't reveal <auto-card>Jegantha, the Wellspring</auto-card> anymore in Game 2 or 3, then that generally means that they boarded in <auto-card>Embercleave</auto-card>. If Jegantha was not revealed in Game 1, then the opponent may be playing the <auto-card>Werewolf Pack Leader</auto-card> version, which is slightly more aggressive.</p>

<p><b>Viability in Explorer</b>: In Explorer, Gruul Vehicles is fully legal and is one of the most popular archetype choices.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Abzan_Greasefang____4869d98e-0168-4c6c-b739-fe75f6e95989===

<p><b>Quick deck summary</b>: Abzan Greasefang is a combo deck with a decent midrange backup plan. Its goal is to put <auto-card>Parhelion II</auto-card> into the graveyard on turn two and to crew it with <auto-card>Greasefang, Okiba Boss</auto-card> on turn three.</p>

<p><b>Regional Championship story</b>: While the deck has had some decent finishes in Regional Championships, such as <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/255043" target="_blank">Eren Kacmaz</a> making it to the Top 8 in Europe and <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/263748" target="_blank">Cameron Sweetnam</a> making it to the Top 8 in Western Canada, it never excelled.</p>

<p><b>Matchup spread</b>: Abzan Greasefang has good matchups against Lotus Field combo and Keruga Fires, but it struggles enormously against Mono-Blue Spirits and Bant Spirits. The matchups against Rakdos Midrange and Mono-Green Devotion are close to even, even with <auto-card>Karn, the Great Creator</auto-card>'s ability to annul <auto-card>Parhelion II</auto-card>'s crew ability.</p>

<p><b>When facing this deck</b>: To best play against this deck, it's important to remember that the best time to kill Greasefang depends on the situation. If the opponent has lots of spare creatures, it's best to kill Greasefang in their main phase before it can trigger. If they have no other pilots, then it's best to kill it with the trigger on the stack so that <auto-card>Parhelion II</auto-card> returns to their hand. Also, if you control <auto-card>Unlicensed Hearse</auto-card> after sideboard, then consider leaving a 2-power crew member untapped to counter <auto-card>Witherbloom Command</auto-card>'s destroy mode.</p>

<p><b>Viability in Explorer</b>: On <i>MTG Arena</i>, Abzan Greasefang is viable, although it's worth noting that <auto-card>Eldritch Evolution</auto-card> and <auto-card>Abrupt Decay</auto-card> are not available. Instead, you could use <auto-card>Liliana of the Veil</auto-card> and <auto-card>Tear Asunder</auto-card>. This archetype was the most-played in the Explorer portion of the <i>Magic</i> World Championship XXVIII several months ago.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Keruga_Fires____3e4b608b-03f5-43ac-b961-4c917cc75514===

<p><b>Quick deck summary</b>: The goal of Keruga Fires is to survive long enough to play <auto-card>Fires of Invention</auto-card> and then dominate the battlefield with five-mana creatures. With <auto-card>Fires of Invention</auto-card>, you can cast Kenrith, Returned King and your companion <auto-card>Keruga, the Macrosage</auto-card> in one turn, leaving mana available for Kenrith activations.</p>

<p><b>Regional Championship story</b>: Keruga Fires had a rough time in the first Regional Championship weekend, largely due to its poor matchup against Mono-Green Devotion. However, after Rakdos Midrange soared ahead, the deck saw more success. <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/260423" target="_blank">Eton Delmoro</a> piloted it to the Top 8 in Southeast Asia, and <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/265486" target="_blank">Brandon Ortiz</a> won with it in Mexico in the penultimate weekend.</p>

<p><b>Matchup spread</b>: Keruga Fires has a bad matchup against Mono-Green Devotion and Azorius Control, but it has a strong advantage against Rakdos Midrange. On the whole, its win rate against the field was poor, and Enigmatic Fires may be a better choice for a <auto-card>Fires of Invention</auto-card> deck.</p>

<p><b>When facing this deck</b>: When playing against this deck, keep in mind that the opponent's options for doing something for less than three mana are limited to <auto-card>Bonecrusher Giant</auto-card>'s adventure, <auto-card>Mystical Dispute</auto-card> from the sideboard, and <auto-card>Leyline Binding</auto-card>. Pay attention to their domain count, as it determines the cost of <auto-card>Leyline Binding</auto-card>.</p>

<p><b>Viability in Explorer</b>: In Explorer, this deck is fully legal.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Lotus_Field_Combo____0348b94f-b043-4b5a-988b-fdfa5fa000d3===

<p><b>Quick deck summary</b>: The game plan of this combo deck is to find <auto-card>Lotus Field</auto-card>, get another copy via <auto-card>Thespian's Stage</auto-card>, and untap those lands with <auto-card>Hidden Strings</auto-card> and <auto-card>Pore Over the Pages</auto-card>, allowing you to generate a lot of mana in one turn. Through a combination of <auto-card>Emergent Ultimatum</auto-card>s, wishes, and tutors, you generally put <auto-card>Omniscience</auto-card> into play, grab <auto-card>Approach of the Second Sun</auto-card> from your sideboard, and cast it twice to win the game.</p>

<p><b>Regional Championship story</b>: Lotus Field was a fringe deck in the first Regional Championship weekend, but <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/256744" target="_blank">John Tatian</a> had a breakout Top 8 finish in the U.S. With an amazing matchup against Izzet Phoenix, it gained popularity. It brought Top 8 finishes for <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/260787" target="_blank">Brennan Crawford</a> in Australia and <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/260054" target="_blank">Matthew Tonary</a> in Eastern Canada, but its success waned as <auto-card>Damping Sphere</auto-card> and other anti-combo sideboard cards became more common in the Pioneer metagame. In later weekends, the deck did not perform as well.</p>

<p><b>Matchup spread</b>: Lotus Field combo has a great matchup against Izzet Phoenix, but it struggles against Mono-White Humans. The matchups against Rakdos Midrange and Mono-Green Devotion are close to even.</p>

<p><b>When facing this deck</b>: A useful way to interact with this combo deck is by destroying their <auto-card>Thespian's Stage</auto-card> with <auto-card>Boseiju, Who Endures</auto-card>, but be sure to choose the right moment—don't let them copy the hexproof <auto-card>Lotus Field</auto-card> in response. In tabletop events, it can be helpful to use pen and paper to track your opponent's mana pool and potential land drop for the turn to keep the game state clear and accurate.</p>

<p><b>Viability in Explorer</b>: On <i>MTG Arena</i>, this archetype is missing <auto-card>Thespian's Stage</auto-card>, <auto-card>Hidden Strings</auto-card>, <auto-card>Pore Over the Pages</auto-card>, <auto-card>Sylvan Scrying</auto-card>, <auto-card>Dark Petition</auto-card>, and <auto-card>Behold the Beyond</auto-card>. As a result, it's not a viable strategy.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Selesnya_Angels____7c8925f4-885f-4794-8ccd-414462afb73f===

<p><b>Quick deck summary</b>: There are many powerful Angels in Pioneer, and Selesnya Angels makes use of several of them. <auto-card>Giada, Font of Hope</auto-card> and <auto-card>Youthful Valkyrie</auto-card> are excellent two-mana Angels, and <auto-card>Bishop of Wings</auto-card> is another strong way to start the curve. <auto-card>Bishop of Wings</auto-card> boosts your life total, which is beneficial for <auto-card>Righteous Valkyrie</auto-card> and <auto-card>Resplendent Angel</auto-card>. With <auto-card>Collected Company</auto-card> and <auto-card>Kayla's Reconstruction</auto-card>, you'll consistently assemble these synergies and fly to victory.</p>

<p><b>Regional Championship story</b>: Selesnya Angels has been on the rise ever since <i><auto-card>The Brothers' War</auto-card></i> added <auto-card>Brushland</auto-card> and <auto-card>Kayla's Reconstruction</auto-card>. In Southeast Asia, <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/260529" target="_blank">Dmitry Medvedev</a> and <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/261083" target="_blank">Alexey Shashov</a> made the Top 8 of their Regional Championships.</p>

<p><b>Matchup spread</b>: Selesnya Angels has a good matchup against Izzet Phoenix, Mono-White Humans and Gruul Vehicles , but it doesn't fare well against Azorius Control.</p>

<p><b>When facing this deck</b>: Keep in mind that their creatures are weak individually but powerful when combined. It's a good idea to destroy their Angels and put pressure on their life total to prevent <auto-card>Giada, Font of Hope</auto-card>, or <auto-card>Righteous Valkyrie</auto-card> from dominating the game. Also, be prepared for a <auto-card>Collected Company</auto-card> into <auto-card>Skyclave Apparition</auto-card> when they pass the turn with four untapped mana, as it can disrupt your combat plans.</p>

<p><b>Viability in Explorer</b>: In Explorer, this deck is fully legal and a popular archetype.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Bant_Spirits____03263d50-d512-4660-9c1e-c13a207a3209===

<p><b>Quick deck summary</b>: Bant Spirits is a popular home for <auto-card>Mausoleum Wanderer</auto-card>, <auto-card>Rattlechains</auto-card>, <auto-card>Shacklegeist</auto-card>, and <auto-card>Supreme Phantom</auto-card>, and it dips into white and green to hit <auto-card>Spell Queller</auto-card> with <auto-card>Collected Company</auto-card>.</p>

<p><b>Regional Championship story</b>: Bant Spirits saw some play, but it had a relatively poor win rate against the overall field and did not have impressive performances.</p>

<p><b>Matchup spread</b>: Bant Spirits has a good matchup against Abzan Greasefang, but it struggles against Rakdos Midrange and Izzet Phoenix.</p>

<p><b>When facing this deck</b>: Be cautious of <auto-card>Spell Queller</auto-card> when they have at least three untapped mana. Think twice before playing your best spell on turn three or four into open mana. Also, remember that <auto-card>Rattlechains</auto-card> can counter your spot removal spells and can grant flash to <auto-card>Supreme Phantom</auto-card>.</p>

<p><b>Viability in Explorer</b>: In Explorer, neither <auto-card>Spell Queller</auto-card> nor <auto-card>Selfless Spirit</auto-card> is available, making Mono-Blue Spirits the dominant approach by far. Almost no one plays Bant Spirits in Explorer.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Mono-Blue_Spirits____5b4d5ccd-34a9-48bf-8802-365c8878e70b===

<p><b>Quick deck summary</b>: Mono-Blue Spirits has many cards in common with Bant Spirits, but it doesn't rely on <auto-card>Collected Company</auto-card>, allowing for more space for noncreature spells, most notably <auto-card>Curious Obsession</auto-card>. If you can stick a <auto-card>Curious Obsession</auto-card> early and protect it with <auto-card>Geistlight Snare</auto-card> or <auto-card>Slip Out the Back</auto-card>, you'll have a significant advantage.</p>

<p><b>The Regional Championship story</b>: Mono-Blue Spirits was about as popular as Bant Spirits, but it had better results. <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/254870" target="_blank">Daniel Kristoff</a> made it to the Top 8 of the U.S. Regional Championship, and <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/258391" target="_blank">Steven Hitchcock</a> made it to the Top 8 in Australia.</p>

<p><b>Matchup spread</b>: Mono-Blue Spirits has a good matchup against Abzan Greasefang and Mono-Green Devotion, but it struggles against Izzet Phoenix. Compared to Bant Spirits, its results against Rakdos Midrange and Mono-Green Devotion were slightly better overall.</p>

<p><b>When facing this deck</b>: Remember that their most-played piece of interaction is <auto-card>Geistlight Snare</auto-card>. Before deciding which spell to cast, check to see if they control a Spirit and an enchantment. If they might be able to play <auto-card>Geistlight Snare</auto-card>, consider sequencing your most important spells around a <auto-card>Mana Leak</auto-card> effect.</p>

<p><b>Viability in Explorer</b>: In Explorer, this deck is fully legal. Mono-Blue Spirits was the third-most played archetype in the Explorer portion of Magic World Championship XXVIII several months ago.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Rakdos_Sacrifice____2c1a40bd-4324-418f-b5c7-4a414bf5cf1b===

<p><b>Quick deck summary</b>: Rakdos Sacrifice is centered around <auto-card>Mayhem Devil</auto-card>, <auto-card>Cauldron Familiar</auto-card>, and <auto-card>Witch's Oven</auto-card>, which create a once-per-turn loop that drains your opponent, deals two damage, and allows you to block for free.</p>

<p><b>Regional Championship story</b>: While only a small portion of the metagame, Rakdos Sacrifice put many players in Regional Championship Top 8s—<a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/256114" target="_blank">André Santos</a> in Europe, <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/255658" target="_blank">Eduardo Vieira</a> in Brazil, <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/262200" target="_blank">Matias Leveratto</a> in South America, and <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/265541" target="_blank">Ricardo Landeta</a> in Mexico. While many players used <auto-card>Jegantha, the Wellspring</auto-card>, non-Jegantha versions with <auto-card>Kari Zev's Expertise</auto-card> put up the best results. Regardless of the specific build, Rakdos Sacrifice had a strong match win rate throughout the regional championships.</p>

<p><b>Matchup spread</b>: Rakdos Sacrifice is well-positioned in the current metagame. It has good matchups against Rakdos Midrange, Mono-White Humans, and Gruul Vehicles, and bad matchups like Izzet Phoenix are on the decline.</p>

<p><b>When facing this deck</b>: Pay close attention to their companion. If they revealed <auto-card>Jegantha, the Wellspring</auto-card> in Game 1 but don't show it in Games 2 or 3, that usually means they've boarded in <auto-card>Kari Zev's Expertise</auto-card>. If they didn't show Jegantha in Game 1, they're probably using the build with main deck <auto-card>Kari Zev's Expertise</auto-card>, so be prepared for your creatures or vehicles to be stolen and sacrificed. If they didn't show Jegantha in Game 1 but only show it after sideboarding when on the play, they're genuine masters of deck construction and sideboard swaps.</p>

<p><b>Viability in Explorer</b>: In the Explorer format, this archetype is missing <auto-card>Urborg, Tomb of Yawgmoth</auto-card> and <auto-card>Dreadbore</auto-card>, none of which are essential. Rakdos Sacrifice was the second-most played archetype in the Explorer portion of Magic World Championship XXVIII several months ago.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Enigmatic_Fires____1e7bbbe0-e217-4967-be48-dce752fd3f05===

<p><b>Quick deck summary</b>: Enigmatic Fires is a toolbox deck that aims to cast <auto-card>Leyline Binding</auto-card> on turn two or turn three, followed by <auto-card>Enigmatic Incarnation</auto-card> on turn four. This allows you to turn your six-mana enchantment into <auto-card>Titan of Industry</auto-card> on turn four. The deck is also capable of powerful turns involving <auto-card>Fires of Invention</auto-card> and the companion <auto-card>Yorion, Sky Nomad</auto-card>. However, every build is different, as there is no consensus on the perfect collection of creatures or lands. Some versions even omit black in favor of better colored mana consistency.</p>

<p><b>Regional Championship story</b>: Despite only being a small portion of the metagame, Enigmatic Fires put a lot of players in Regional Championship Top 8s—<a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/253423" target="_blank">Chris Ferber</a> in the U.S., <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/260190" target="_blank">Norbie Mendoza</a> in Southeast Asia, <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/262440" target="_blank">Joaquin Maletti</a> in South America, and <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/265521" target="_blank">Alonso Mijares</a> in Mexico. Enigmatic Fires had an excellent match win rate throughout the Regional Championships.</p>

<p><b>Matchup spread</b>: Enigmatic Fires is well-positioned in the current metagame. It preys on Rakdos Midrange because effects like <auto-card>Back to Nature</auto-card> or <auto-card>Erase</auto-card> are not available in red or black. Additionally, it has a good matchup against Gruul Vehicles. However, it struggles against Azorius Control.</p>

<p><b>When facing this deck</b>: Be aware that their most common play is to turn a two-mana enchantment into a three-mana creature with an enters-the-battlefield ability. This could be <auto-card>Skyclave Apparition</auto-card> to exile your best threat, <auto-card>Knight of Autumn</auto-card> to gain life, <auto-card>Callous Bloodmage</auto-card> to exile your graveyard, or <auto-card>Moon-Blessed Cleric</auto-card> to search for <auto-card>Leyline Binding</auto-card>. Keeping this in mind will help you better plan for what their deck is capable of.</p>

<p><b>Viability in Explorer</b>: On <i>MTG Arena</i>, <auto-card>Chained to the Rocks</auto-card> is not available, and you'll also need to find replacements for <auto-card>Radiant Flames</auto-card> and <auto-card>Dragonlord Atarka</auto-card> in the sideboard. Nevertheless, <auto-card>Enigmatic Incarnation</auto-card> is playable in Explorer.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Mono-Red_Aggro____e62a51f9-a726-4700-9923-56b08f9f0bb0===

<p><b>Quick deck summary</b>: Mono-Red Aggro is a fast, aggressive deck with several different versions. Some focus on creatures, using cards like <auto-card>Burning-Tree Emissary</auto-card>, <auto-card>Anax, Hardened in the Forge</auto-card>, and <auto-card>Embercleave</auto-card>, while others use damage-oriented cards like <auto-card>Eidolon of the Great Revel</auto-card>, <auto-card>Light Up the Stage</auto-card>, and <auto-card>Lightning Strike</auto-card>. There are also hybrid versions that combine multiple aspects. The goal of all these versions is to take your opponent down to zero life as quickly as possible.</p>

<p><b>Regional Championship story</b>: <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/262330" target="_blank">Alejandro Sepúlveda</a> won the South America Regional Championship with a Mono-Red Aggro build that I would describe as a hybrid version.</p>

<p><b>Matchup spread</b>: Most versions of Mono-Red Aggro have a good matchup against Mono-Green Devotion, but struggle against Gruul Vehicles. However, this depends on the specific build.</p>

<p><b>When facing this deck</b>: When your opponent casts <auto-card>Kumano Faces Kakkazan</auto-card> on turn one, be aware that there are many different builds, each with its own strategies. Some may require you to play around <auto-card>Embercleave</auto-card>, while others may require you to protect your life total at all costs.</p>

<p><b>Viability in Explorer</b>: In the Explorer format, <auto-card>Roast</auto-card> is not available, but it can be replaced with <auto-card>Obliterating Bolt</auto-card>. This could even be an improvement if <auto-card>Old-Growth Troll</auto-card> is more popular than Sheoldred. Mono-Red Aggro is a popular choice in Explorer.</p>

<h1>Looking Ahead</h1>

<p>The Pioneer format offers a range of powerful archetypes, rewards players for their experience, and provides the tools needed to counter any strategy. The best deck choice for the metagame can vary from week to week. In the future, we may see a decline of Rakdos Midrange and an increase in the popularity of Mono-White Humans and Gruul Vehicles. Rakdos Sacrifice and Enigmatic Fires may also become more popular as they try to take advantage of this changing metagame. This could lead to a decrease in popularity for Mono-White Humans and Gruul Vehicles, and Mono-Green Devotion may make a comeback.</p>

<p>The release of the new set, <i>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</i>, is likely to shake things up in February as players prepare for the Pro Tour. The event, which will feature both Pioneer and <i>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</i> draft, will take place at <a href="https://mcphiladelphia.mtgfestivals.com/content/sitebuilder/rna/mtg-festivals/global/en-us/magiccon-news/magiccon-philadelphia-the-lineup.html" target="_blank">MagicCon: Philadelphia</a> on February 17-19. High-level tabletop <i>Magic</i> is back, and I'm excited to see it blossom in 2023 with the return the Pro Tour.</p>

<p>If you're eager to start your competitive <i>Magic</i> journey, store-level RCQs are a great place to start.

<p>That World Championship was the last in-person premier play tournament before the COVID-19 pandemic changed the landscape of competitive play. With the return to the name "Pro Tour" and revisted bustling convention halls, shuffling up, and sitting down across from an opponent, Pro Tour: Phyrexia is the beginning of a journey back to the hallmarks of competitive, tabletop Magic.</p>

<p>There's the draft, with its specially stamped cards and the thrill of seeing players draft a niche archetype that was still unknown. There's the convention center, buzzing with players and the hush that falls over the room when a round begins. There's finding your friends, hopefully at the top tables of the tournament and being there to cheer as the Top 8 is announced.</p>

<p>These are the experiences that longtime competitive <i>Magic</i> players recall and look forward to again when they step into the hall at the Philadelphia Convention Center. Those form the core of a <i>Magic</i> journey important to William Jensen, the <i>Magic </i>Hall of Famer and former World Champion who stepped into the role of Director of Play Programs in 2022.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/H0B2tnpKhDJ6VK2KcsXkJ/43c05eef732235558cfdb78d4c7a4990/281x225-2021-MPL-William-Jensen-Front.png" /><p class="embedImageCaption">William Jensen</p></div></div><br />

<p>"To me, playing competitive <i>Magic</i> and specifically tabletop competitive <i>Magic</i> has been the defining aspect and experience of my life," Jensen said. "I hope that current and future generations of <i>Magic</i> players can have a chance to have similar experiences."</p>

<p>With the first return-to-tabletop Pro Tour only two weeks away, players have an opportunity to look forward to some of what's been missing in the past three years—exactly what gathering to make memories made us wistful for first.</p>

<p>"Meeting with my <i>Magic</i> friends," was what World Champion Javier Dominguez missed most about tabletop events, and it's a common refrain among players returning to the Pro Tour in Philadelphia.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/1IND5E1BnpFAC1qiZjdcSf/8e83ad285388e46bbcc053a919ce3481/281x225-2021-MPL-Javier-Dominguez-Front.png" style="margin: 3px;" /><p class="embedImageCaption">Javier Dominguez</p></div><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/1BOXTtXYeyMOw4GbTQzOi3/b793a2c2e51348e5c427a8909420563c/281x225-Mike-Sigrist-Player-Card-Front.png" style="margin: 3px;" /><p class="embedImageCaption">Mike Sigrist</p></div></div><br />

<p>"Easily my friends," said 2015 Player of the Year Mike Sigrist. "I haven't seen tons of my friends since the start of the pandemic, and while I got to see some for Worlds this year, I'll get to see even more at the Pro Tour."</p>

<p>For some players, that excitement around seeing friends and competitors in person again is matched by the excitement of playing tabletop Magic.</p>

<p>"A year ago I would've said that I mostly missed seeing friends and meeting new people," said Hall of Fame member Reid Duke. "Now that I've started playing again, I realize how much I missed the physical cards. Little things like having pride in your collection, the feeling of sleeving your deck before the event – they really add to the experience!"</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/2Pzgm1eetWNRazz4LRCzeT/9877f9c13f990a078e819df6116d099b/281x225-2021-MPL-Reid-Duke-Front.png" style="margin: 3px;" /><p class="embedImageCaption">Reid Duke</p></div><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/4KrMasJO6zkVRvuPn3YtNw/51a0126ccfa25b09c7fb6fa2edaf10a9/281x225-Simon-Nielsen-New-Capenna-Front.png" style="margin: 3px;" /><p class="embedImageCaption">Simon Nielsen</p></div></div><br />

<p>That sentiment is shared by Simon Nielsen, member of the 2014 winning World Magic Cup team, frequent Grand Prix Top 8-er, and New Capenna Set Championship finalist.</p>

<p>"At the actual game table, I have missed the sensory feelings: shuffling my smooth sleeves, the satisfying clack of a newly drawn card hitting my hand and the confidence of turning all my Dinosaurs sideways in one sweeping motion. And connecting with my opponent, an actual-factual human being right in front of me ... those sensations are just not present online."</p>

<p>In addition to seeing friends and players in person for the first time in years, Draft topped the list of experiences these longtime players are most looking forward to.</p>

<p>"This is the first time in years Limited will be such a huge percentage of the rounds of the event," Sigrist said. "There's nothing quite like peeling back that first pack and squeezing and hoping to see a busted, stamped Mythic."</p>

<p><b>"</b><i>Players, pick up your cards, you have 50 seconds</i>," Nielsen said, quoting the omnipresent voice of the judge at the start of each Pro Tour draft. "Just let me draft again! I even miss jotting down the tiny marks on those stupid deck registration sheets for draft."</p>

<p>Both the draft and the return of tabletop play mean that testing for the Pro Tour will look different from the tournament preparation of the last three years. Testing teams evolved during the era of online premier play, migrating to online messaging apps which benefitted by making international connections.</p>

<p>Those changes have stuck for some groups, like Team Handshake, which both Dominguez and Nielsen are part of. The return to tabletop play means merging the playtesting practices that have served them well for the past three years with proven methods from before the pandemic.</p>

<p>"Well, first of all, we have some teammates who have barely played any competitive [tabletop] <i>Magic</i> and we have needed to teach them the ways of resolving a trigger in real life and such," Nielsen joked. "Usually, all of our preparation on Team Handshake has been in our Discord Group, and that's also where we have started this time. But what's new here is that we will meet up at an Airbnb in Philadelphia, one week before the event and finish our testing process there. This will also include live drafts and teaching Julian how to tap a land."</p>

<p>Some players, like Duke. are focused on some of the other challenges that come with tabletop play. "I'm taking extra steps to make sure I'm not rusty, and that I can reliably finish matches in time."</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/7LjoOq45fqa4FEsqfMOflW/94f61a121eec76417e2c952acc4743be/1920x1080_Consider_MID_Artwork.png" /></div></div><br />

<p>While drafting is an exciting return for many players, it changes the logistics of preparation that has, for the most part, been focused on two different Constructed formats for the past three years—a welcome change for returning competitors.</p>

<p>"Honestly it is <i>much</i> less stressful than two Constructed formats," Nielsen said. "When you're trying to test for, for example, Standard and Historic you always have to balance how much time you spend on each, and it never feels like enough. Preparing for draft is so much more relaxed, because it never feels like working on a project where you have to specifically pick out match-ups to practice over and over. You're just joining a new draft queue and discussing picks with teammates."</p>

<p>Mike Sigrist, another tabletop titan and veteran of the Pro Tour, has a plan that sounds as familiar as its been successful through the years.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/1BOXTtXYeyMOw4GbTQzOi3/b793a2c2e51348e5c427a8909420563c/281x225-Mike-Sigrist-Player-Card-Front.png" /><p class="embedImageCaption">Mike Sigrist</p></div></div><br />

<p>"I'm pretty used to balancing this from past Pro Tours, but we'll try and get as much Pioneer work done as we can at first, then likely shift our focus to mostly Limited for a bit, and then in the last few days back to Pioneer," Sigrist said. "It's nice to have two formats that are completely different to break up the monotony of playing just all Pioneer or all <i>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</i> Limited."</p>

<p>Draft rounds are also traditionally ones where players practiced in the format plan to pick up games against competitors who are less versed in it.</p>

<p>"I expect everyone to have a good deck and be well-prepared for Pioneer, so I'm hoping I can work hard and come in with an advantage for the Draft portion," Duke said. Starting each day with a 3-0 or 2-1 record is an advantage everyone can understand.</p>

<p>Returning to competitive tabletop play is a place where players with previous experience at in-person tournaments can leverage comfort as an advantage again players who prefer competitive <i>Magic</i>'s digital play.</p>

<p>"I would say [I am] slightly advantaged because of experience," Dominguez said.</p>

<p>Duke matched his own estimation of his own edge against the field. "I have an experience advantage over most of the PT field, and I think that counts for something."</p>

<p>Not every player sees it quite that way though.</p>

<p>"I actually think I land somewhere in the middle," Sigrist said. "I haven't played a single game of paper <i>Magic</i> since the start of the pandemic. All of the MPL and Rivals matches were held online, and that's where I focused my attention for [the game]," Sigrist said. "I do obviously have a lot of experience at paper events but there's others who won't be as rusty with stuff like making sure they don't miss triggers, and fully see the battlefield before making decisions since they've been playing paper <i>Magic</i> for a while now. Then, there's another group of people who have quite literally never played paper before this event and learned to play during the pandemic on <i>MTG Arena</i> and <i>Magic Online</i>."</p>

<p>"Well, in-person I can't listen to music while I play so that must clearly be a disadvantage," Nielsen said, alluding to his rocking out all through the Top 8 of the New Capenna Championship. He finished second in the event, so it obviously served him well.</p>

<p>"I do have other ways to relieve the tension that builds up at high level match as I am quite talkative and try to make sure that I relax and have fun with my opponent, especially between games," Nielsen added. "I believe that playing in a less tense atmosphere lets me play tighter. Plus I have enough experience comprehending a boardstate, remembering triggers etc that I think live <i>Magic</i> is better for me. But who knows, the last few years have certainly been my best. So was that because I got better and joined a great team, or is it because online play (and dancing) just suit me better?"</p>

<p>When the first round starts at Pro Tour Phyrexia, it ushers in a strange combination of the future and the past. It's both a return to tabletop competitive <i>Magic</i>, and a look forward to the Regional Championships, Pro Tours, and <i>Magic </i>World Championship still to come in 2023. For some players, including many of those with stellar tournament finishes in the past three years, it will be an entirely new kind of competitive play. For others, it's a return to the <i>Magic</i> they love most.</p>

<p>"The Pro Tour is so important to me as both a player and a fan of the game," Duke said. "It helps me feel connected to <i>Magic</i> players across all parts of the world and all eras of the game's history."</p>

<p>"My life was consumed by traveling to paper events," Sigrist said, "and while I will never go back to a time where I'm traveling weekly because I have a family at home, the fact it's available to me is a sign that things will be okay."</p>

<p>Jensen, overseeing a worldwide system of play to reward, excite, and welcome tabletop players everywhere perhaps said it best.</p>

<p>"None of what we do with competitive <i>Magic</i> would be possible without the players and the community who have unending passion for both <i>Magic</i> and competition," he said. "Lots of players have made lifelong relationships competing in our games and tournaments, which is something that makes me very happy both personally and professionally. As for the competition, there's something special about sitting across the table from someone, looking them in the eye, whether they are a friend or someone you're meeting for the first time, and engaging in a game of <i>Magic</i> where both players are trying their best to make the best decisions and do what they can to come out on top."</p>

<p>For many players, the return to the Pro Tour means more than just a chance to play competitive tabletop <i>Magic</i> against the best players in the world again: It's about the game, the connections, and the friendships made over years and miles.</p>

<p>"Tabletop tournaments mean that I get to see my friends," Nielsen said. "I have traveled for tournaments for a decade now, and that results in a geographically widely scattered friend group who I have only vaguely been able to keep in touch with these past few years. That's what means the most."</p>

<p>Next week, players from around the globe will <a href="https://magic.gg/events/pro-tour-phyrexia" target="_blank">gather in Philadelphia for the triumphant return of the tabletop Pro Tour</a>! This first class of new pros battled their way through Regional Championship Qualifiers (RCQs) and Regional Championships to reach <i>Magic</i>'s biggest stage. And with that first class in our new system hitting the Pro Tour, we've incorporated some of their feedback—and the feedback of players who participated in RCQs around the world—into our next season.</p>

<p>One of the biggest issues that prevented players from participating in multiple RCQs was the difficulty in maintaining multiple decks across multiple formats and staying up to date in those formats. Originally, we left it up to the local stores to determine their RCQ formats—they know their players best, after all.</p>

<p>However, what ended up happening was that players who would have otherwise wanted to attend multiple events in their area largely didn't when the formats were different. So, if a player had the time and interest to attend two events but one was Pioneer and the other was Modern, they may not have been able to maintain two decks and the format knowledge necessary to compete, often picking one and skipping the other.</p>

<p>We also heard from content creators that people who wanted to create content around the RCQ season had difficulty doing so because three different Constructed formats were difficult to cover effectively. While we're making these changes for RCQ participants first, it's a strong bonus reason that it helps people making competitive-focused content.</p>

<p>Therefore, starting with Season 2, Round 1, of the Regional Championship Qualifiers (April–August), we'll be requiring in-store RCQs to run either Pioneer Constructed or the current Limited format. Certain larger events will still be able to provide RCQ support as part of other events.</p>

<p>To give stores some flexibility and support our Limited fans, Limited will remain an option with the designated Constructed format for all RCQ rounds.</p>

<p>Additionally, for the 2023–2024 season, Regional Championships will also match the Constructed format of the corresponding RCQ rounds. This is not necessarily the case for the corresponding Pro Tours, and we'll announce those formats later.</p>

<p>Our goal is to unify the competitive playing community during this time and lower the barrier for players to play in multiple events. We are constantly looking to tweak and improve our <a href="https://magic.gg/pro-tour" target="_blank">path to the Pro Tour</a>. Here's Director of Play Programs Billy Jensen talking more about the change.</p>

<h1>RCQ Promos</h1>

<p>And a new Regional Championship Qualifiers round means new promos!</p>

<p>The qualifying round for the Regional Championships that feed into Pro Tour 4 will start April 22, 2023, and will run until August 20, 2023. During that time, participating WPN stores and approved organizers will host Regional Championship Qualifiers that award invitations to the Regional Championship(s) within their respective region. Those Regional Championship events will take place in the late September to late November 2023 timeframe and award invitations to Pro Tour 4 in the first part of 2024. Additionally, based on feedback from the last season, we're slightly extending the qualifying round lengths so that stores have a little more time to plan when their event takes place.</p>

<p>You'll also notice a difference with this round. In the same fashion as the announced Pro Tour and <i>Secret Lair</i> Showdown cards that are making their debut at MagicCon: Philadelphia, RCQ and Regional Championship promos are making their debut in the <i>Secret Lair</i> Prize Card category! Supported by our friends on the <i>Secret Lair</i> team, these special promo cards will give the competitive <i>Magic </i>community an opportunity to obtain prize cards featuring a wider range of art styles.</p>

<p>While supplies last, this round of RCQs will, like with the other rounds, award promos for participation as well as for top-finishing players. The promos will once again be getting a refresh for this round and will feature brand-new, never-before-seen art and our popular borderless treatment.</p>

<p>The April 22–August 20, 2023, Regional Championship Qualifier promo cards are as follows*:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Unholy Heat: Non-foil versions are available by participating in local qualifiers. Traditional foil versions are available as well through participating in larger open qualifying events as well as side events at Regional Championships.

<p>Ready to play some <i>Magic</i> with <i>Phyrexia: All WIll Be One</i>? From friendly to competitive you're in the right place! Below you'll find a <i>compleat</i> listing of play popportunites from your local Wizards Play Network (WPN) game stores all the way up to the big MagicCon: Philadelphia celebration.</p>

<h1>Prerelease: February 3–9</h1>

<p>This Friday is the beginning of your <i>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</i> fun with Prerelease, featuring either <i>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</i> Prerelease Packs or Jumpstart boosters (your choice on which, if not both, are subject to availability at your participating local game store).</p>

<p>Prerelease is traditionally supported with a Prerelease Pack that contains everything you need to play:</p>

<ul>
	<li>6 <i>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</i> Draft Boosters</li>
	<li>A foil stamped rare or mythic rare from <i>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</i></li>
	<li>A code for <i>Magic: The Gathering Arena</i> which you can redeem for some goodies on your <i>MTG Arena</i> account (in locations available)</li>
	<li>A Spindown life counter</li>
</ul>

<p>For this round, <i>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</i> adds a special twist if you're one of the fortunate few to find a truly compleat Prerelease Pack, as 1 in 15 features a Phyrexian language Spindown life counter which are beautful to see!</p>

<p>Playing in a Prerelease is easy. Just head on down to <a href="https://locator.wizards.com/" target="_blank">your WPN-affiliated local game store</a>, pick up a Prerelease Pack after entering, and then build a deck for a few rounds of games.</p>

<p>Most stores will offer events in a traditional tournament structure with prizes that scale based on performance. Some may also offer a more streamlined build-and-play option, where you build a deck, play, and simply enjoy the new <i>Magic</i> cards, so check with your local stores for all the details.</p>

<p>New to the game, and not sure if you want to dive into Sealed? <i>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</i> Jumpstart Boosters offer an alternative way to engage with Prerelease. All you need are two Jumpstart Boosters, then just open them, shuffle up, and you're ready to play!</p>

<p>Players who do play in an event at their local store may also be able to obtain promo cards celebrating <i>Magic</i>'s 30th anniversary, featuring iconic cards selected from 2000-2003.</p>

<h1>MagicCon: Philadelphia: February 17–19</h1>

<p>Philadelphia is your cannot-miss destination a week after release, as the city of brotherly love is playing host to <a href="https://mcphiladelphia.mtgfestivals.com/" target="_blank">MagicCon: Philadelphia</a>, the first of four big 2023 convention celebrations of <i>Magic</i> run in partnership with ReedPop!</p>

<p>MagicCon will also play host to the aptly named Pro Tour Phyrexia, fittingly the first <i>Magic: The Gathering</i> Pro Tour to take place since its revival was announced last year. At Pro Tour Phyrexia, a few hundred of the world's very best <i>Magic: The Gathering</i> players will compete in a three-day tournament featuring a whopping $500,000 prize pool. The formats are <i>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</i> Booster Draft in the morning of Friday and Saturday, and then Pioneer Constructed for five rounds afterward each of those days. Pioneer is also the Top 8 format on Sunday as the final remaining players compete to see who will take home the title.</p>

<p>The invited players who participate in Pro Tour Phyrexia will get a special Jace, the Mind Sculptor Secret Lair Prize Card simply for making it that far in non-foil, while the Top 16 finishers in the event will also take home a foil version.</p>

<p>For the competitive player looking for an opportunity to show their skills, MagicCon: Philadelphia will also host Pro Tour Qualifiers (which qualify top finishers for the next Pro Tour at MagicCon: Minneapolis) as well as the <i>Secret Lair</i> Showdown where players receive a Secret Lair promo simply for participating and compete for some coveted Secret Lair Prize Cards, including an alternate-art Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer and a <i>very</i> special variant on Brainstorm.</p>

<p>And there's plenty to do at MagicCon for Commander fans and more. It'd take a whole article to showcase what all is in store for this weekend...<a href="https://magic.gg/news/magiccon-philadelphia-and-the-2023-magiccon-schedule" target="_blank">which is why a whole article was already written covering some of the highlights in store for attendees</a>!</p>

<p>Tickets are still available, but as we get closer to the big weekend, they might not be, <a href="https://mcphiladelphia.mtgfestivals.com/en-us/tickets/buy-tickets.html" target="_blank">so don't delay if you want to attend and book today!</a></p>

<h1>Store Championship: February 25–March 5</h1>

<p>Looking for a local tournament to test out some new strategies? Are you interested in being your local champ? Perhaps you're new to competitive <i>Magic</i>, and are looking for practice and chances to level your skill up?</p>

<p>If so then the Store Championship is for you, and <a href="https://locator.wizards.com/" target="_blank">every WPN game store</a> can run one!</p>

<p>This promo-supported program ensures WPN stores have some participation, Top 8, and winner promo cards to support a local tournament for their community. WPN Premium stores get a little extra touch, as the top 8 and winner cards will feature their store's name emblazoned on each of their promos so that recipients have some extra bragging rights on just where they top finished or even won their store championship.</p>

<p>For this round, the Store Championship is now going to follow a prescriptive format offering, of which stores will choose from, that their event can be run as. For the ONE Store Championship, the options are Pioneer Constructed or a Limited (Sealed or Booster Draft) format featuring <i>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</i> draft boosters, more closely following the format of the Pro Tour that this event follows.</p>

<p>Participants (while supplies last) will receive this alternate version of Annex Sentry from the new set:</p>

<h1>Commander Party: March 10–12</h1>

<p>Commander Party's back, and it's a compleat experience ready for you!</p>

<p>Well no, it actually isn't, that's just on-theme phrasing, but it's close to complete for the current story arc, and <i>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</i> sets the stage for concluding story resolutions with <i>March of the Machine</i> in a few months. This WPN Premium-exclusive event lets Premium retailers host an exciting party for Commander players to enjoy during the weekend. Retailers who ran a <i>Dominaria United</i> and <i>The Brothers' War</i> Commander Party also get to continue the development of their game-altering adventure, with exciting moments to unfold that can be different from store-to-store.</p>

<p>Players who participate will be able to use a faction card that will add some exciting shifts to their typical Commander game, and Phyrexia has a few of those...five, to be precise, which will make this exciting riff on typical Commander play one that participants may want to revisit a few times this season.</p>

<p>On top of all that, participating players will also get a Phyrexian-language Norn's Annex simply for playing in one.</p>

<h1>Friday Night <i>Magic</i>: Every Friday (February 10–April 7)</h1>

<p>No week is truly compleat without enjoying a Friday night out with your friends at a Friday Night <i>Magic</i> (FNM for short), a longstanding weekly event that is...anything your store wants to run for their local players! FNM is very open, can be casual, can be competitive, it's up to what local players in your area enjoy and what your store wants to run.</p>

<p>FNM takes place—well you guessed it—every Friday. WPN stores receive WPN Promo Packs to support their events with prizes. While these can be used across different events, tournaments, and the like, FNM is a typical place where you'll see them rewarded. Aside from featuring some goodies such as rare and mythic cards from a curated list and a code for a <i>Magic: The Gathering Arena</i> booster pack redeemable via the in-game shop, these packs also include one of an assortment of dark-frame promos. The selects for ONE you'll see featured below:</p>

<p>These events also have additional prizes, including prize money. The prize pool for each Regional Championship will differ in each region, so check your region's organizer website for more info on the prize schedule.</p>

<p>Regional Championships are invitation-only events, but organizers will typically host Last Chance Qualifiers for those looking for one final shot at playing in the main event.</p>

<p>Even if you aren't qualified, organizers will typically offer plenty of things to do if you want to watch, support friends, or play in some side events, including for Commander players who just want to attend and game. While the Regional Championship is a focused competitive tournament qualifying for the Pro Tour and the <i>Magic</i> World Championship, there's a lot to do if you aren't qualified—or if you simply want to enjoy a weekend, cheer on some friends, or make some new ones.</p>

<p>Regional Championships are a place for everyone that loves competitive <i>Magic</i> to gather!</p>

<h1>February 2023 Qualifier Weekend Event Information</h1>

<h2>Event Format</h2>

<p>February 2023 Qualifier Weekend’s <i>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</i> Phantom Sealed. Players compete in Best-of-Three events with a minimum 40-card deck (including lands) from their pool of cards, with the rest comprising their sideboard. Cards opened in the Sealed and Draft events will <i>not</i> be added to players' collections.</p>

<h2>Event Schedule</h2>

<h4>Friday, February 10th</h4>

<p>Players who have qualified for this event will see a Qualifier Token in the top right corner of the screen beside the Wildcard display and receive an email with initial event details and their final standing in the Ranked Ladder.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/QbElxCE1Ef6mxOjqZXPlQ/812fb9a41cc56172c2ad0f452889c9f7/508x144-Qualifier-Weekend-Information-Token-Text.jpg" /></div></div><br />

<p><i>NOTE: This is a systemic change—you will no longer see the Qualifier Badge on your Profile tab. The presence of the Qualifier Token is the sole in-client method of showing qualification prior to the event.</i></p>

<p>If you earn an invitation via a Wizards-approved tournament organizer or from the Arena Open, your Qualifier Token will be granted at the same time as ranked season players in the month you qualified (i.e., if your event took place in June, you would receive your Qualifier Token by July 6).</p>

<p>The grant of Qualifier Tokens to accounts is a manual process completed by the date listed above following the ranked season's completion. Please wait to contact Customer Service until then to confirm your eligibility.</p>

<p>If you believe you have qualified <i>(via the Ladder or via another method)</i> and you do not see the Qualifier Token on your account after the date mentioned for the season you qualified, please contact <a href="https://mtgarena-support.wizards.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000419612" target="_blank">Customer Service</a> as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Players who finished 251st-1200th in the Ranked Season in either Constructed or Limited <i>(and did not finish in the Top 250 in the other Ladder)</i> will be granted 20 Play-In Points by this date – more details can be <a href="https://magic.gg/events/qualifier-play-in" target="_blank">found here</a>.</p>

<h4>Saturday, February 10th</h4>

<p>6 a.m. PT <i>(14:00 UTC)</i>: Players with the Qualifier Token <i>(including those earned during the Friday Play-In event)</i> will be able to see the Day One event.</p>

<p>Players who earn maximum wins in the Friday Play-In event will be awarded a Qualifier Token as part of their prize.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/1x0IEtJG4QjaOZQ5nR0pTH/6057f362de1f0d7f27fcf7e08099c2dc/1600x867-Qualifier-Weekend-Information-Day-1-Entry-Screen.jpg" /></div></div><br />

<p>Players who hold a direct invitation to Day Two will receive a Day Two Token by this time. Once the Day Two Token is on their account, this group of players will <i>only</i> be able to see the Day Two event.</p>

<p>If you believe you have qualified, but you do not see the event in-game, please contact <a href="https://mtgarena-support.wizards.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000419612" target="_blank">Customer Service</a> by Friday, February 24th at 5 p.m. PT (midnight UTC December 8th<i>)</i>.

<p>Only matches completed by the season end time count toward the final ranking for the month.</p>

<h2>Qualifier Play-In Events</h2>

<p>Players can also earn the Qualifier Token by earning maximum wins in a single course of a Play-In event feeding that Qualifier Weekend. There are typically two Qualifier Play-Ins each month:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A Best-of-One event is held on Saturday, seven days before Qualifier Weekend.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>A Best-of-Three event is held on Friday, the day before Qualifier Weekend.</li>
</ul>

<p>Players who already hold an invitation to Qualifier Weekend are permitted to enter Qualifier Play-In events, though any invitations earned are redundant and do not pass down to other players or months.</p>

<h1>Qualifier Weekend Structure</h1>

<p>The Qualifier Weekend takes place as a special event in <i>Magic: The Gathering Arena</i>. Players who have the Qualifier Token in their account will see the event and will be eligible to compete in one course of it during Day One. Both days of competition are Best-of-Three with sideboarding.</p>

<h2>General Structure—Day One</h2>

<p>For Constructed formats, the event will allow a player to select their deck prior to any match play, but once a deck is chosen, it cannot be changed for the remainder of the Day One event.</p>

<p>For Phantom Sealed formats, players will have access to six Limited boosters of the corresponding <i>Magic</i> set and must build a deck with a minimum of 40 cards. Other cards that were opened and available in the Sealed pool will be available in that player's sideboard between games of each Best-of-Three match. Additionally, players may modify their 40-card deck between matches during this event after initially submitting a deck. Cards opened will not be added to players' collections.</p>

<p>For Phantom Draft formats, players will draft anonymously within the Traditional Draft queue and must build a deck with a minimum of 40 cards. Other cards that were drafted will be available in that player's sideboard between games of each Best-of-Three match. Additionally, players may modify their main deck between matches during this event. After each match completes, each player's deck will be automatically de-sideboarded by the game client. Cards opened will not be added to players' collections.</p>

<h2>Day One Entry Window</h2>

<p>Players will be able to join the event on Day One no earlier than Saturday at 6 a.m. PT and no later than 8 a.m. PT. Late entries <i>cannot</i> be accommodated. The entry window is in place to ensure lower matchmaking times and to permit players enough time to complete all Day One matches.</p>

<p>Players can participate in Day One until they receive either seven match wins or two match losses. If a player earns seven match wins, an in-game notification will appear, and a Day Two Token will appear on the top right corner of the player's Home screen in-client.</p>

<h2>General Structure—Day Two</h2>

<p>For Day Two, players will only be able to participate if they earned seven match wins on Day One, or they were directly invited to Day Two as mentioned above. Eligible players should receive a Day Two Token that appears in the top right corner of the Home screen. That token will appear in eligible players' accounts by the Thursday prior to the Qualifier Weekend (for direct invitees) or as soon as the seven-win Day One course ends. Players who expect to be able to join Day Two but cannot do so should contact <a href="https://mtgarena-support.wizards.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000419612" target="_blank">Customer Support</a> for assistance.</p>

<p>Due to the Day Two event being available to many fewer participants than Day One, competitors are strongly encouraged to complete all their games as soon as possible. As the event nears its completion, matchmaking times may take longer than normal.</p>

<p>Players who are eligible to participate on Day Two can play in one course that ends when they receive either seven match wins or two match losses.</p>

<p>For Constructed formats, players are permitted to enter with the same deck as Day One (if applicable), the same deck but with changes, or a different deck. Once a player begins their Day Two course, no further deck changes are permitted.</p>

<p>For Phantom Sealed formats, like Day One, players will have access to a new pool of six Limited boosters of the corresponding <i>Magic</i> set and must build a deck with a minimum of 40 cards. Other cards that were opened and available in the Sealed pool will be available in that player's sideboard between games of each Best-of-Three match. Additionally, players may modify their 40-card deck between matches during this event after initially submitting a deck. Cards opened will not be added to players' collections.</p>

<p>For Phantom Draft formats, like Day One, players will draft a new deck anonymously within the Traditional Draft queue and must build a deck with a minimum of 40 cards. Other cards that were drafted will be available in that player's sideboard between games of each Best-of-Three match. Additionally, players may modify their main deck between matches during this event. After each match completes, each player's deck will be automatically de-sideboarded by the game client. Cards opened will not be added to players' collections.</p>

<h2>Day Two Entry Window</h2>

<p>Players will be able to join the event on Day Two no earlier than Sunday at 6 a.m. PT and no later than 8 a.m. PT. Late entries <i>cannot</i> be accommodated. The entry window is in place to ensure lower matchmaking times and to permit players enough time to complete all Day Two matches.</p>

<h2>Match Play in Arena</h2>

<p>Players are expected to compete under the implemented rules for <i>Magic: The Gathering Arena</i>.</p>

<p>Each player will have 30 minutes on their respective match clock that will count down whenever that player has priority. To see the clock, hover your cursor over the bottom-left corner of the screen beside your display name.</p>

<p>If a player runs out of time on their clock before the current game finishes, they will lose the match regardless of the current board state.</p>

<h2>Participation</h2>

<p>Participation in the Qualifier Weekend, the Arena Championship, or any events supported by Wizards of the Coast or the <i>Magic</i> Pro League LLC, is contingent on players having accounts that are in good standing for <i>Magic: The Gathering Arena</i> and competitive tabletop <i>Magic: The Gathering</i>. Players suspended from participation in <i>Magic: The Gathering Arena</i> or in sanctioned tabletop tournaments are ineligible for any prizes and subject to additional action.</p>

<p>Players in <i>Magic: The Gathering Arena</i> events are required to follow the Wizards <a href="http://company.wizards.com/legal/terms" target="_blank">Terms and Conditions</a>.</p>

<h2>Connectivity and Known Issues</h2>

<p>Players should review <a href="https://mtgarena-support.wizards.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000091646-Known-Issues-List" target="_blank">known issues</a> in <i>Magic: The Gathering Arena</i> prior to participation in the Qualifier Weekend and the Arena Championship. Wizards is not responsible for impacts on the game because of players experiencing known issues.</p>

<p>Wizards of the Coast is not responsible for the results of any disconnection or network problems experienced by players.</p>

<h2>Eligibility &amp; Prizes</h2>

<p>Once a player qualifies for the Arena Championship, they become ineligible to participate in other Qualifier Play-In events and Qualifier Weekends feeding that Championship. Players who qualify for the Championship will have their Qualifier Token removed if they otherwise would receive it through monthly ranked season performance.</p>

<p>That player can continue to compete in <i>Magic Online</i> Premier Play.</p>

<p>All prizes are awarded “as is” and without warranty of any kind, expressed, or implied (including without limitation, any implied warranty or merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose). This is a contest of skill and, therefore, there are no odds of winning as is the case with a game of chance. All applicable taxes, fees, duties, tariffs, passport or visa costs, and any license, destination, entry, exit, and/or delivery charges are the sole responsibility of each player. Taxes on prizes (including, without limitation, income taxes), if any, are the sole responsibility of any player winners.</p>

<p>Invitations to the Arena Championship are contingent on signing a waiver and consent form. These documents will be provided to all competitors who receive invitations so that they can sign and submit prior to attending the event.</p>

<p>Players may be disqualified from the Qualifier Weekend or from participation in the Arena Championship if they are suspended from <i>Magic: The Gathering Arena</i> or sanctioned <i>Magic: The Gathering</i> tabletop play for any reason, including without limitation, a violation of the <i>Magic: The Gathering Arena</i> End User License Agreement.</p>

<p>Although a player may have multiple accounts qualified for the Qualifier Weekend event, only one of those accounts can be entered into that event. Players are not permitted to have any accounts entered in events played by other players for any reason. If a player is discovered to have more than one account playing in the Qualifier Weekend before, during, or after the event, Wizards may take action against that player's account(s), up to and including disqualification, suspension of the offending account(s), and/or termination of the offending account(s). Using an account other than your own, allowing any other player to use your account, selling your account, and other similar actions are all violations of the <i>Magic: The Gathering Arena</i> User Agreement.</p>

<p>Wizards of the Coast reserves the right to reschedule and/or restart tournaments, matches, and extend timers and/or games as needed.</p>

<p>To be eligible to participate in Qualifier Weekend and the Arena Championship, the following requirements must be met:</p>

<ul>
	<li>All players must be at least 18 years of age or older on the date of the event.</li>
	<li>Players must have internet access and a <a href="https://myaccounts.wizards.com/login" target="_blank">Wizards Account</a>.</li>

<h2>Ranked Ladder Finishes</h2>

<p>Players who finish in places 251-1,200 in either Ranked Ladder (Constructed or Limited) will be granted 20 Play-In Points during the first full week of the month following that ranked season. They will also receive an email invitation with their final standing as well as Qualifier Play-In details.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Players are awarded only the prize for the single-highest finish between the two Ladders</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Top 250 on both Ladders yields only one Qualifier Token</li>
		<li>Top 250 on one Ladder and 251-1,200 on the other Ladder yields only the Qualifier Token (no Play-In Points)</li>
		<li>251-1,200 on both ladders yields 20 Play-In Points</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Players with an awarded Qualifier Token <i>(usually from previous month's Arena Open)</i> who finish Top 250 on one or both Ladders earn 20 Play-In Points.</li>

<h2>Match Play in MTG Arena</h2>

<p>Players are expected to compete under the implemented rules for <i>Magic: The Gathering Arena</i>.</p>

<p>Each player will have 30 minutes on their respective match clock that will count down whenever that player has priority. To see the clock, hover your cursor over the bottom left corner of the screen beside your display name.</p>

<p>If a player runs out of time on their clock before the current game finishes, they will lose the match regardless of the current board state.</p>

<h2>Participation</h2>

<p>Participation in Qualifier Play-In events, Qualifier Weekend, and the Arena Championship, or any events supported by Wizards of the Coast or the <i>Magic</i> Pro League LLC is contingent on players having accounts that are in good standing for <i>Magic: The Gathering Arena</i> and competitive tabletop <i>Magic: The Gathering</i>.

<h2>Eligibility &amp; Prizes</h2>

<p>Once a player qualifies for the Arena Championship, they become ineligible to participate in other Qualifier Play-In events and Qualifier Weekends feeding that Championship. Players who qualify for the Championship will have their Qualifier Token removed if they otherwise would receive it through monthly ranked season performance.</p>

<p>That player can continue to compete in <i>Magic Online</i> Premier Play.</p>

<p>All prizes are awarded "as is" and without warranty of any kind, expressed, or implied (including without limitation, any implied warranty or merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose). This is a contest of skill and, therefore, there are no odds of winning as is the case with a game of chance.

<p>Players may be disqualified from Qualifier Play-In events, Qualifier Weekend or from participation in the Arena Championship if they are suspended from <i>Magic: The Gathering Arena</i> or sanctioned <i>Magic: The Gathering</i> tabletop play for any reason, including without limitation, a violation of the <i>Magic: The Gathering Arena</i> End User License Agreement.</p>

<p>Although a player may have multiple accounts qualified for the Qualifier Weekend event, only one of those accounts can be entered into that event. Players are not permitted to have any accounts entered in events played by other players for any reason. If a player is discovered to have more than one account playing in the Qualifier Weekend before, during, or after the event, Wizards may take action against that player's account(s), up to and including disqualification, suspension of the offending account(s), and/or termination of the offending account(s). Using an account other than your own, allowing any other player to use your account, selling your account, and other similar actions are all violations of the <i>Magic: The Gathering Arena</i> User Agreement.</p>

As we count down the days until <a href="https://mcphiladelphia.mtgfestivals.com/content/sitebuilder/rna/mtg-festivals/global/en-us/magiccon-news/The-Countdown-to-MagicCon-Philadelphia-Begins.html" target="_blank">MagicCon: Philadelphia</a> and the first tabletop Pro Tour in years, today's article takes a closer look at the Pioneer format that is featured in the event.</p>

<p>As the first cycle of Regional Championships saw the awarding of most of the Pro Tour invitations, the decks that found success last November and December provide a good indication of what to expect at <a href="https://magic.gg/events/pro-tour-phyrexia" target="_blank">Pro Tour Phyrexia</a>. In the first week of January, I already broke down <a href="https://magic.gg/news/metagame-mentor-the-top-15-pioneer-decks-from-regional-championships" target="_blank">the Top 15 Pioneer deck archetypes from the Regional Championships</a> and provided an in-depth analysis of their game plans, matchups, and more.</p>

<p>Today, after an update on January's metagame developments, I'm taking a further look at the ten spiciest Pioneer decks that also qualified for the Pro Tour. I wouldn't be surprised to see several archetype experts using their proficiency with their qualifying deck to crush the Pro Tour with an off-meta brew. Along the way, I'll also be highlighting key additions that <i>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</i> may bring to the format.</p>

<h1>The Pioneer Metagame in January 2023</h1>

<p><a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/formats/pioneer" target="_blank">Pioneer</a> is a non-rotating format based on expansion sets and core sets from <i>Return to Ravnica</i> onward, with the most notable cards on <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/banned-restricted-list#pioneer-banned" target="_blank">the ban list</a> being the fetch lands. With nearly 10,000 legal cards, Pioneer enables a variety of powerful strategies. If you'd like a deeper introduction to the format, I again recommend <a href="https://www.magic.gg/news/metagame-mentor-the-top-15-pioneer-decks-from-regional-championships" target="_blank">my primer</a> on the top fifteen archetypes from Regional Championships.</p>

<p>However, the metagame is ever evolving. To keep up with the latest Pioneer developments, I analyzed 572 decklists from competitive events held in January. This included all available <a href="https://www.mtgo.com/en/mtgo/decklists" target="_blank"><i>Magic Online</i> decklists</a> from scheduled Pioneer events that month, as well as the Top 8 decklists from the Champions Cup Store Qualifiers in <a href="https://www.hareruyamtg.com/en/deck/result?eventName=Chanpions+Cup+Cycle+3+Store+Quarifier+in+Kichijoji%5BTop8SE%5D%5BReservation%5D" target="_blank">Kichijoji</a>, <a href="https://www.hareruyamtg.com/en/deck/result?eventName=Champions+Cup+Cycle+3+Store+Qualifier+-+Hareruya+TC+Tokyo" target="_blank">Tokyo</a>, and <a href="https://www.hareruyamtg.com/en/deck/result?eventName=Champions+Cup+Cycle3+Store+Qualifier+in+Yokohama%5BTop8SE%5D%5BReservation%5D" target="_blank">Yokohama</a>, the <a href="https://twitter.com/JimmyTo_85/status/1617226425588748291" target="_blank">Store Qualifier at MTG Oasis Chile</a>, and the <a href="https://mtgnearme.com/?p=198" target="_blank">RCQ at Gamers Paradise</a>.</p>

<p>To provide a metagame snapshot that combines popularity and performance, I assigned an archetype label to each deck and awarded points equal to the deck's net wins—that, its number of match wins minus losses.</p>

<p>For example, a deck that went 5–1 in the Swiss followed by a loss in the quarterfinals was assigned three points. When the points for each archetype are added up, they yield the record-weighted metagame share, which represents the archetype's share of total net wins. This can be thought of as the "winner's metagame," as it reflects what you're likely to encounter at the top tables.</p>

The number of competitive Pioneer decks remains enormous, and with a diverse set of aggro, midrange, control, ramp, and combo decks all being viable, the Pioneer format offers a wide range of options to suit any type of playstyle.</p>

<p>The most-played nonland cards across all main decks and sideboards were <auto-card>Fable of the Mirror-Breaker</auto-card>, <auto-card>Thoughtseize</auto-card>, <auto-card>Fatal Push</auto-card>, <auto-card>Llanowar Elves</auto-card>, <auto-card>Elvish Mystic</auto-card>, and <auto-card>Bonecrusher Giant</auto-card>. These staples remain the pillars of the format, and they can be found in a variety of decks.</p>

<p>Compared to the Regional Championships from November and December, the biggest metagame developments are:</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>An uptick of Selesnya Angels.</b> Selesnya Angels has been on the rise ever since <i>The Brothers’ War</i> added <auto-card>Kayla's Reconstruction</auto-card>, with lists becoming increasingly refined and the most successful versions cutting main deck <auto-card>Portable Hole</auto-card> in favor of additional copies of <auto-card>Inspiring Overseer</auto-card>.</li>
	<li><b>An uptick of Rakdos Sacrifice.</b> Rakdos Sacrifice, which posted excellent match win rates throughout the Regional Championships, has also seen an increase in play due to its favorable matchups against Rakdos Midrange, Mono-White Humans, and Gruul Vehicles. Many of the top Rakdos Sacrifice decks have been adopting <auto-card>Eaten Alive</auto-card> instead of <auto-card>Village Rites</auto-card> in their main decks.</li>
	<li><b>An uptick of Lotus Field combo</b>. Lotus Field combo preys on the rise of Selesnya Angels and Rakdos Sacrifice, two decks that are relatively slow and lack interaction against the combo.</li>
</ul>

<p>To speed up the deck, many Lotus Field players have been incorporating <auto-card>Hope Tender</auto-card>, which can untap Lotus Field for a mana boost. Although <auto-card>Hope Tender</auto-card> is weak against creature removal, it gives a significant edge in the mirror match and puts opponents in a difficult position during sideboarding. As a result of the rise in Lotus Field combo, sideboard cards like <auto-card>Damping Sphere</auto-card> have become more prevalent.</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>A downtick of Izzet Phoenix.</b> With bad matchups against Lotus Field combo and Selesnya Angels, Izzet Phoenix is on the decline in the present metagame. However, the power of <auto-card>Treasure Cruise</auto-card> and <auto-card>Arclight Phoenix</auto-card> cannot be denied; if Pioneer players start to skimp on graveyard hate or if the metagame changes, then Izzet Phoenix could be poised for a comeback.</li>
	<li><b>A downtick of Rakdos Midrange</b>. After its dominance at the Regional Championships, Rakdos Midrange has seen a downturn in popularity as bad matchups such as Gruul Vehicles, Rakdos Sacrifice, and Enigmatic Fires are on the rise. Examining successful Rakdos Sacrifice decklists, we can see that <auto-card>Unlicensed Hearse</auto-card> is being swapped out for <auto-card>Pithing Needle</auto-card> in the sideboard, likely in response to the decreased prevalence of <auto-card>Arclight Phoenix</auto-card> and the increased prevalence of <auto-card>Thespian's Stage</auto-card>.</li>
	<li><b>The emergence of Azorius Spirits</b>. Unlike Bant Spirits and Mono-Blue Spirits, Azorius Spirits does not have access to <auto-card>Collected Company</auto-card> or <auto-card>Ascendant Spirit</auto-card>. However, it combines the best of both worlds, having access to both <auto-card>Spell Queller</auto-card> and <auto-card>Curious Obsession</auto-card>. As players are having newfound success with this build, and <auto-card>Seachrome Coast</auto-card> will soon be added to Pioneer, Azorius has become the most popular Spirits color combination over the past month.</li>
</ul>

<p>Although Mono-Green Devotion, Lotus Field combo, Rakdos Midrange, Azorius Control, and Selesnya Angels are likely to be popular choices at Pro Tour Phyrexia, they also have a target on their heads. Indeed, this January 2023 metagame is not a Nash equilibrium. If this were the starting metagame at the Pro Tour, then simulations of the tournament based on the matchup matrix from the Regional Championships suggest that the top tables may be dominated by increased numbers of Rakdos Sacrifice and Mono-White Humans, while Selesnya Angels and Rakdos Midrange would falter.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the new cards from <i>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</i> could drastically alter the format, and the Regional Championships have already shown that a few under-the-radar decks have the potential to succeed as well. It will be interesting to see how the Pro Tour plays out and which strategies will come out on top.</p>

<h1>The Ten Spiciest Pioneer Decks That Qualified for the Pro Tour</h1>

<p>The top tables of the Regional Championships featured several largely unexpected decks. It's always exciting to witness brewers doing well with their own creations, and if they bring the same decks or new brews to the Pro Tour, they'll be ones to watch. To recognize the innovativeness of these players, let's check out the ten most unique decks that have earned a Pro Tour invite!</p>

<p>To be included in my selection, a deck archetype needed to fall outside the top fifteen most popular ones from the Regional Championships, as these were already discussed in my aforementioned <a href="https://www.magic.gg/news/metagame-mentor-the-top-15-pioneer-decks-from-regional-championships" target="_blank">earlier article</a>. Of the remaining off-meta deck archetypes, including those that snuck into the top fifteen in the January 2023 metagame, I chose those based on their spiciness, their performance in tournaments last month, and their potential gains from <i>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</i>.</p>

===decklistId:Grinning_Ignus_Combo_Dimitar_Erinin_European_Championship_November 19, 2022_c8dc5b14-2d36-4434-9540-4f7daf306d8d===

<p>Dimitar Erinin proved the strength of <auto-card>Grinning Ignus</auto-card> combo by chaining his Last Chance Qualifier victory into a 17th-place finish at the European Championship. This deck's game plan is to use <auto-card>Grinning Ignus</auto-card> to generate an endless loop of enters-the-battlefield triggers. To continually cast <auto-card>Grinning Ignus</auto-card> in a mana-neutral way, the deck uses <auto-card>Birgi, God of Storytelling</auto-card>, <auto-card>Hazoret's Monument</auto-card>, or <auto-card>Runaway Steam-Kin</auto-card>. This results in an endless loop of enters-the-battlefield triggers, which can be exploited to draw cards with <auto-card>Risen Reef</auto-card>, gain life with <auto-card>Prosperous Innkeeper</auto-card>, or deal damage with <auto-card>Defiler of Instinct</auto-card>.</p>

<p>Evaluating <i>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</i>, I expect that the allied fast lands will make the largest impact to the format in general, and <auto-card>Copperline Gorge</auto-card> could bolster the mana base of <auto-card>Grinning Ignus</auto-card> combo in particular. Green Sun's Twilight, despite its lower potency, could also be an appealing option for a deck filled with mana creatures.</p>

===decklistId:Elves_Scott_Polsky_West_Canada_Regional_Championship_December 10, 2022_ff13a1b8-eb69-4d99-a07f-e6a9395d25e0===

<p>Scott Polsky, who recently earned a Pro Tour invite thanks to his beloved Elves archetype, has been playing it in every format from Pauper to Pioneer and Modern. Elves can quickly ramp ahead with <auto-card>Elvish Mystic</auto-card> and <auto-card>Llanowar Elves</auto-card> in the early game, boost their forces with <auto-card>Elvish Clancaller</auto-card> and <auto-card>Leaf-Crowned Visionary</auto-card> in the mid-game, and secure victory by casting <auto-card>Chord of Calling</auto-card> for <auto-card>Shaman of the Pack</auto-card> in the late game.</p>

<p><i>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</i> introduces Tyvar, Jubilant Brawler, an interesting new option for this strategy. By untapping mana Elves and granting them haste, Tyvar can produce a quick mana boost, while his -2 ability often returns an Elf lord.</p>

===decklistId:Selesnya_Auras_Michael_Letsch_U.S._Regional_Championship_November 19, 2022_f587d005-f100-4d2a-821c-e54a9cc46807===

<p>Selesnya Auras, which exploits <auto-card>Light-Paws, Emperor's Voice</auto-card> and <auto-card>Sram, Senior Edificer</auto-card>, qualified three players for the Pro Tour. Besides Michael Letsch, who finished in the Top 4 of the U.S. Regional Championship, <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/256447" target="_blank">Victor Kurz</a> and <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/260212" target="_blank">Justin Chin</a> also made it. Despite its impressive performance, the deck has yet to become a Pioneer mainstay.</p>

<p>But this could all change with the introduction of <i>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</i>. <auto-card>Razorverge Thicket</auto-card> is a massive boost for the deck's mana base, and Skrelv, Defector Mite could be a great addition too. Reminiscent of <auto-card>Giver of Runes</auto-card>, Skrelv can be used to protect Light-Paws or Sram from removal, and it can push an enormous creature past blockers. Additionally, Skrelv counts as an artifact for <auto-card>All That Glitters</auto-card> and might even unlock <auto-card>Mox Amber</auto-card> for the deck. All in all, Skrelv looks to be one of the most impactful cards from the new set.</p>

===decklistId:Dimir_Control_Julian_Prado_South_America_Regional_Championship_December 3, 2022_4b84ba18-00a6-4eab-a301-fe1435a6aa04===

<p>While traditional builds of Dimir Control have also found success, such as the one used by <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/255118" target="_blank">Álvaro Almeida</a>, I'm more intrigued by versions that incorporate <auto-card>Day's Undoing</auto-card>. Julian Prado earned a Pro Tour invite through exploiting the combo potential of <auto-card>Narset, Parter of Veils</auto-card> or <auto-card>Notion Thief</auto-card> with <auto-card>Day's Undoing</auto-card>. When either of these permanents are on the battlefield, <auto-card>Day's Undoing</auto-card> allows the Dimir Control player to draw seven new cards while their opponent draws either none or one.</p>

<p>If this deck shows up at the Pro Tour, then we may get to witness a feature match of epic proportions. The Dimir Control player could bounce their opponent's creature with <auto-card>Rona's Vortex</auto-card>, make them draw a card with <auto-card>Baleful Mastery</auto-card>, and then cast <auto-card>Day's Undoing</auto-card>, leaving the opponent with nothing. Then, immediately after the opponent draws a card in their draw step, the Dimir Control player could activate <auto-card>Geier Reach Sanitarium</auto-card>, effectively locking the opponent out of the game and sending Twitch chat into a frenzy.</p>

===decklistId:Mono-Black_Midrange_Michael_Siembor_U.S._Regional_Championship_November 19, 2022_b44426d1-c3d6-4c9a-9688-5f18e1eb432f===

<p>Mono-Black Midrange is similar to Rakdos Midrange, yet featuring <auto-card>Gifted Aetherborn</auto-card> and <auto-card>Invoke Despair</auto-card> instead of <auto-card>Bloodtithe Harvester</auto-card> and <auto-card>Fable of the Mirror-Breaker</auto-card>. The deck clinched a Pro Tour invite for Michael Siembor, and it has since seen multiple decent tournament finishes, including a <a href="https://www.mtgo.com/en/mtgo/decklist/pioneer-challenge-2023-01-1412509957#deck_LizzieBus" target="_blank">Top 8 in a <i>Magic Online</i> Challenge</a>.</p>

<p>From <i>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</i>, <auto-card>Phyrexian Obliterator</auto-card> and/or <auto-card>Phyrexian Arena</auto-card> could offer a potential new direction for the Mono-Black Midrange. If the deck were to shift its focus to devotion, these cards could be the perfect way to supercharge <auto-card>Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx</auto-card>.</p>

===decklistId:Izzet_Creativity_Alessandro_Parisi_European_Championship_November 19, 2022_80ea04c5-57a9-42fa-be97-2555bf4adcd4===

<p>Izzet Creativity has been performing well lately, and it has two distinct versions. The most prominent one, which Alessandro Parisi took to a 13th-place finish at the European Championship, is built around casting <auto-card>Indomitable Creativity</auto-card> for X=2 and putting <auto-card>Worldspine Wurm</auto-card> and <auto-card>Xenagos, God of Revels</auto-card> onto the battlefield. This combo then creates a 30/30 creature with trample and haste, allowing for a swift victory. The other option, which won <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/255307" target="_blank">Lukasz Siwarski</a> a Pro Tour invite, uses <auto-card>Torrential Gearhulk</auto-card> alongside Magma Opus as the win condition.</p>

<p>An intriguing alternative from <i>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</i> is Atraxa, Grand Unifier. While she doesn't win the game immediately, she's able to outrace <auto-card>Parhelion II</auto-card>, dodge <auto-card>Power Word Kill</auto-card>, and stand tall against <auto-card>Skysovereign, Consul Flagship</auto-card>. Even if Atraxa is destroyed, her enters-the-battlefield ability could still bring a backup <auto-card>Indomitable Creativity</auto-card> from the top ten cards. All in all, Atraxa seems like a powerful addition to any deck that can cheat her out.</p>

===decklistId:Storm_Herald_Combo_Marc_Tobiasch_European_Championship_November 19, 2022_1d068252-6dcf-4e07-b667-f18f38096761===

<p>Pro Tour Amonkhet Top 8 competitor Marc Tobiasch, renowned for brewing the spiciest decks, shocked the competition by finishing 21st at the European Championship with a never-before-seen-deck. This deck's gameplan revolves around <auto-card>Colossification</auto-card> and <auto-card>Burning Anger</auto-card>, which are put into the graveyard and then returned to the battlefield with <auto-card>Storm Herald</auto-card>. This allows you to immediately ping your opponent for upwards of 20 damage. Since the enters-the-battlefield trigger of <auto-card>Storm Herald</auto-card> doesn't target, you may attach the Auras to any creature upon resolution, which helps dodge the opponent's spot removal spells.</p>

<p>From <i>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</i>, Nahiri, the Unforgiving is an interesting option. Although a different mana base and build would be required, Nahiri can discard an Aura if you drew it, or copy <auto-card>Storm Herald</auto-card> if you milled it. This combination of abilities could prove incredibly useful.</p>

===decklistId:Jund_Citadel_Samuel_Eberhard_European_Championship_November 19, 2022_aedea695-0113-4676-8b5b-96405af86be6===

<p>At the European Championship, Jund Citadel piloted by Samuel Eberhard finished a respectable 19th. With the help of <auto-card>Woe Strider</auto-card> to scry lands to the bottom of your library and <auto-card>Prosperous Innkeeper</auto-card> to bolster your life total, <auto-card>Bolas's Citadel</auto-card> allows you to cast a flurry of cards from the top of your library. Once you have assembled ten nonland permanents, including <auto-card>Mayhem Devil</auto-card>, an activation of <auto-card>Bolas's Citadel</auto-card> can deal lethal damage.</p>

<p>As I already mentioned, I expect that the allied fast lands will make a big impact on Pioneer. Although these lands are most beneficial to fast two-color decks, Jund Citadel could also benefit from the inclusion of several <auto-card>Blackcleave Cliffs</auto-card> to improve its mana base.</p>

===decklistId:Orzhov_Midrange_Raja_Sulaiman_European_Championship_November 19, 2022_4ad508b4-13a6-4dc6-a06b-bf431a52133c===

<p>Raja Sulaiman earned his Pro Tour invitation with a unique Orzhov Midrange deck. The deck exploits <auto-card>Wasteland Strangler</auto-card>'s ability to "process" cards exiled by <auto-card>Elite Spellbinder</auto-card>, <auto-card>Skyclave Apparition</auto-card>, or <auto-card>Vanishing Verse</auto-card>. This intricate decklist is a testament to Sulaiman's deck building prowess.</p>

<p>Sulaiman is making a name for himself; he won the 2022 NRG Series Championship last month and was subsequently interviewed by Corbin Hosler in <a href="https://www.magic.gg/news/the-week-that-was-sulaimans-success" target="_blank">The Week That Was</a>. Although he switched to Rakdos Midrange for the Pioneer portion of that tournament, he crushed the Modern portion with a fascinating Bant Control brew. I'm eager to see what he'll bring to Pro Tour Phyrexia.</p>

===decklistId:Esper_Greasefang_Michael_Knie_West_Canada_Regional_Championship_December 10, 2022_766093dc-7ce7-415f-b8c9-014bcdf49620===

<p>The goal of any Greasefang deck is to put <auto-card>Parhelion II</auto-card> into the graveyard on turn two, and to crew it with <auto-card>Greasefang, Okiba Boss</auto-card> on turn three. Abzan combo-midrange remains the most popular shell for this strategy, but Michael Knie proved that an Esper combo-control variant is also viable, as evidenced by his second-place finish at the Regional Championship in Calgary. Featuring <auto-card>Supreme Verdict</auto-card> and <auto-card>Dig Through Time</auto-card>, it plays out much differently than an Abzan deck with <auto-card>Raffine's Informant</auto-card> and <auto-card>Esika's Chariot</auto-card>.</p>

<p>For more aggressive versions of Esper Greasefang, <auto-card>Seachrome Coast</auto-card> and <auto-card>Darkslick Shores</auto-card> may earn a few slots after <i>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</i> becomes legal. For control builds like Knie's, Sheoldred's Edict could be an interesting new option, as it can answer creatures and planeswalkers at instant speed for only two mana.</p>

<h1>Looking Ahead</h1>

<br />

<p>As a reminder, card styles are a cosmetic option only and do not add any cards to a player's collection. There is no benefit to acquiring a card style more than once; if you achieve Gold Rank or higher in both Limited and Constructed, you will only receive one copy of the card style.</p>

<h1>Qualifier Weekend Invitation</h1>

<p>Players who finish in the top 250 of Mythic-ranked competitors will qualify to participate in the <a href="https://magic.gg/mtg-arena?section=qualifier-weekend#mtg-arena" target="_blank">Qualifier Weekend</a> shown below. Matches that finish prior to 12:00 p.m. PT (UTC-08:00) on February 28, 2023, will count toward final season ranking for February, which determines invitations to the March Qualifier Weekend.</p>

<h1>Qualifier Play-Ins</h1>

<p>Players can earn the Qualifier Token for entry to a Qualifier Weekend by reaching maximum wins in a single course of a Play-In event that feeds that Qualifier Weekend.</p>

<p>There are typically two Qualifier Play-Ins each month:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A Best-of-One event is held on Saturday, seven days before Qualifier Weekend.</li>
	<li>A Best-of-Three event is held on Friday, the day before Qualifier Weekend.</li>
</ul>

<p>Learn more on the <a href="https://magic.gg/events/qualifier-play-in" target="_blank">Qualifier Play-In Information page</a>.</p>

<p>Information on what the Qualifier Weekend feeds, its format, and other details are available on the <a href="https://magic.gg/events/qualifier-weekend" target="_blank">Qualifier Weekend Information page</a>.</p>

<p>If you're a veteran, you might have been here before, ages ago. If you're newer to the plane, welcome! No matter who you are, you're in for a wild time.</p>

<p>Phyrexians are <i>Magic</i>'s oldest baddies, and they've converted nearly this entire plane to their liking. Full of majestic (and often unsettling) landscapes, it's truly like no other place in the Multiverse.</p>

<p>So where can you check it out? The <i>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</i> Prerelease, of course!</p>

<p>Prereleases are some of my favorite <i>Magic</i> events, perfect for newcomers and seasoned veterans alike. They're the celebration of a new set, and <i>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</i> has its Prerelease from February 3–9.</p>

<p>First up, if you want to learn how to play <i>Magic</i>, I recommend some of these resources:</p>

</ul>

<p>Additionally, if you're looking for a store to play in, I always recommend our handy store locator tool. Just enter your location, and it'll show any stores near you:</p>

</ul>

<p>Once you've found a spot, be sure to contact them about preregistering. Prereleases are popular events, and you'll want to make sure you have a seat at the table.</p>

<p>Now, if you prefer to hear about some of this in a video, I have a companion video to this article you can check out over on Good Morning <i>Magic</i>:</p>

<embed-iframe fallback-img="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/68dmLnpvHNJRAAMtXUzEfy/5648ac6397e9fdb1d250a991e154cc2e/1920x1080_Good_Morning_Magic_Thumbnail_20230130.png" has-consent="true"   width="950" height="534" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3mxKwsee1Qs" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></embed-iframe>

<p>But what makes a Prerelease so awesome? Why should you trek out to New Phyrexia? Let's dig in a bit.</p>

<h1>Preparing for the Prerelease</h1>

<p>There's nothing like handling fresh cards from a new set, and that's exactly what you get to do at a Prerelease. Everyone's on equal footing: nobody has these cards before the Prerelease, and it's your first chance to explore the set and see how they all work together.</p>

<p>The energy in the room of a Prerelease is palpable. Relaxed and fun as people open their cards, exclaim about the cool things they've found, and discover cool combinations for the very first time.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/1bP3qnGuiUnbLZd4PAlfft/dc9fc12a2a64f8b4080ad602bce3042d/1920x1080_In_Store_Play_PT_Announce.png" /></div></div><br />

<p>One of the really great things about the Prerelease is that it's a great environment for helping you through your first event. Even if you're brand new, people will be there in the store to support you and help you have a fantastic experience.</p>

<p>And what's going on in this set? It's part of an epic story, one where our heroes planeswalk to New Phyrexia to stop the Phyrexian invasion before it begins. And . . . well, <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/story" target="_blank">you can go read the story</a> to see what's going on for yourself.</p>

<p>So, do you need to bring a deck from home? Nope! For a Prerelease, you will play a format called <b>Sealed Deck</b>. It's straightforward: open the six <i>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</i> Draft Boosters from your Prerelease Pack and build a deck with the contents. It really <i>is</i> all about the new set and what's inside. You'll want to look over everything, from the commons to the rares, to build the best deck you can. (You can check out all the cards beforehand in our <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/card-image-gallery/phyrexia-all-will-be-one" target="_blank"><i>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</i> Card Image Gallery</a>.)</p>

<p>How exactly does this work out? Let me walk you through it.</p>

<h1>All Will Be Sealed</h1>

<p>When you sit down on Prerelease day, you're going to get handed a <i>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</i> Prerelease Pack.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/tikGxiW0xvMUcb3VrvRNb/5eb3477e23310426e2db5f74311c9de6/en_8Nwy27DByw.png" /></div></div><br />

<p>While there are many things in here, like a spindown life counter for tracking your life total and a fun little insert with some information and tips, the most important are these six Draft Boosters:</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/1ynVqzHwLYDkNgCAI87zMb/0ed2115cf00c9768cc1e7949535a626b/en_82nYDBweyjDw.png" /></div></div><br />

<p>Open them all and check out your new stack of cards. There will also be a foil-stamped rare or mythic rare card inside that you can play—make sure to pull that one out. Then, you're ready to build a deck.</p>

<p>But where do you even start?</p>

<p>Well, first thing's first, you should know what you're trying to do. In Sealed Deck, you only need 40 cards, not 60 or 100. You can get as many additional basic lands as you want from the store.</p>

<p>A good rule of thumb is to play 17 lands. So, all things said and done, <b>you're only looking to play about</b> <b>23 nonland cards from the cards you open</b>. That's your goal: identify the 23 cards to play.</p>

<p>Okay, sounds a bit easier. How do you go about picking those cards?</p>

<p>Try sorting your cards by color first. Make eight piles: one for each color, one for any multicolor cards, one for colorless cards, and one for lands. As you're going through, you'll have a chance to read the cards and see what interests you.</p>

<p>You'll want to whittle your choices down to two colors. You can sometimes "splash" a third, playing two colors as your base and a couple powerful cards or additional costs of another color, but I'd really focus on the two colors you want here. You can select them in any ways you want—maybe you just like those colors—but three things to keep an eye out for are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Any strong rares in those colors that you're excited to play</li>
	<li>A lot of removal cards (Cards which destroy or otherwise deal with your opponent's creatures.)</li>
	<li>Evasion (A lot of Sealed Deck games are won with flying creatures or hard-to-block cards.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, another huge element to look out for are good synergies and multicolor cards. Every two-color pairing in <i>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</i> has a theme, and knowing what those are can clue you in to which colors to play.</p>

<p>Once you've chosen your colors, it's important to think about your mana curve. This helps to ensure that you have creatures at every turn of the game to cast. If everything costs six mana, you're going to be way behind on playing creatures, and if everything costs two mana, you're going to get outclassed in the late game.</p>

<p>Here's how to check your mana curve. First, lay your creatures out in mana-value order from left to right. So, all creatures that cost one mana, then all creatures that cost two, and so on. Only lay out noncreatures here if they're cards you are planning to play as soon as you have that much mana—for example, you might play an Equipment on turn two, so that counts as a two-drop, but you're probably not playing a removal spell on turn two.</p>

<p>One thing to keep in mind for <i>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</i> is the For Mirrodin! mechanic. For example, as you see it here:</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: center;">
	<div class="embedImagePositioner">
		<img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/71bDpMJBBv7zaupmK9eU85/37deaaecccaaf950afc85591071ec847/en_9899932c01.png" style="width: 265px; height: 370px; margin: 5px;"/>
	</div>
	<div class="embedImagePositioner">
		<img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/3PImTXH6dueEAcVaccajwL/aed1a95bd6b2236f1b1e1e094c0a8c20/en_b2aba51741.png" style="width: 265px; height: 370px; margin: 5px;"/>
	</div>
</div>
<br/>

<p>These are Equipment cards, but they act more like creatures since they come in with one. So, as you're laying out your mana curve, be sure to count them as creatures.</p>

<p>For Limited in general—and this is just a guideline—I'd look to play something like this:</p>

<ul>
	<li>1 mana: 0–2</li>
	<li>2 mana: 4–6</li>
	<li>3 mana: 3–5</li>
	<li>4 mana: 2–4</li>
	<li>5 mana 1–3</li>
	<li>6+ mana: 0–2</li>
</ul>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/6tgxE0rEHBlLob7wAHnAxU/32d77f49538a21ce64df868c8385c954/BB20170525_New-Curve-White.png" width="920" /></div></div><br />

<p>Once you have those figured out, go ahead and add in your noncreature spells. You will probably want to play all your removal spells to deal with your opponents' creatures. Beyond that, it's nice to have ways to pump up your creatures at instant speed and ways to draw cards. But you can season to taste depending on what you think might work well in your deck.</p>

<p>And there you have it! When you're finished, you should have a 40-card deck. You can play more than 40 cards, but I would strongly advise against it: every card you play beyond 40 just worsens the odds of drawing your best cards.</p>

<p>So, that's how you build a sealed deck. But what are the mechanics you can expect? Let me run you through them.</p>

<h1>Mechanics of <i>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</i></h1>

<p>New Phyrexia is a dangerous plane, and it has some dangerous mechanics to match, from toxic and proliferate to the mechanic of the good guys—For Mirrodin!—but that depends on your definition of "good."</p>

<p>To learn more about all the mechanics and details on how they work, check out the <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/feature/phyrexia-all-will-be-one-mechanics" target="_blank"><i>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</i> mechanics article</a>.</p>

<h1>Into the Phyrexian Lair</h1>

<p>The Prerelease is just around the corner, from February 3–9. Check in with <a href="https://locator.wizards.com/" target="_blank">your local game store</a>, look over the <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/card-image-gallery/phyrexia-all-will-be-one" target="_blank"><i>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</i> Card Image Gallery</a>, and prepare yourself for a good time!</p>

<p>Oh, and one more thing—you can preorder booster displays for pickup at the Prerelease as well. So, if you want the <i>compleat</i> package, you can bring <i>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</i> home—just be sure to talk with your local store about grabbing one.</p>

<p>I hope this helped you on your Prerelease journey. And, as always, if you have any questions, feel free to hit me up on Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, or YouTube—I always appreciate hearing what people have to say.</p>

<p>Enjoy the set and have fun!</p>

These have been a staple of <i>Magic</i> tournaments for 30 years, and it's always a chance to get the entire tournament together at one time. Not only is this great for event photographers like me, but it's when the head judge gives the basic rundown of the day and makes any important reminders to players. More excitingly, it's also when things like attendance records get announced as broken, or the final moments before players tear into a new set. In other words, it's a very normal pre-tournament occurrence.</p>

<p>But this was decidedly <i>not</i> a normal tournament.</p>

<p>Compared to cavernous convention centers and dozens of rows of table, the room for this event felt intimate. There's almost no background buzz, if you don't count the palpable nerves of those anxiously preparing to do battle with their counterparts in that tiny players meeting.</p>

<p>I've learned something in my decade of covering <i>Magic</i> tournaments: the quieter it is, the higher the stakes. And a tournament of just 16 people can be <i>quiet</i>.</p>

<p>This "small-field" tournament is something reserved for the most exclusive events, often end-of-season celebrations put on to pit the best of the best against each other. It's most famously been used in the <i>Magic</i> World Championship at times in the past, and let me tell you there is little more intense than watching Reid Duke and Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa staring down a World Championship match.</p>

<p>While <i>Magic</i> World Championship XXIX is going back to a large-field event (loosely defined by me as more than 64 or so competitors), there was another tournament circuit showcasing its best of the best from the past year. And no one shined brighter than Raja Sulaiman, who performed under pressure round after round on his way to the title at the NRG Series Championship last weekend. And while it may not have been worlds, make no mistake that this field featured some of the best players in the region right now.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">After an amazing year of Magic with 28 events and over 2,000 players giving it their all, we&#39;re down to our final event and just 16 players remain.<br><br>Let&#39;s give a huge congratulations to the field for the 2022 NRG Series Championship 🏆<br><br>Be sure to tune in January 14-15, 2023! <a href="https://t.co/AZONxx6nlE">pic.twitter.com/AZONxx6nlE</a></p>&mdash; NRG Series (@NRGSeries) <a href="https://twitter.com/NRGSeries/status/1602499824900636672?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 13, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>We've <a href="https://magic.gg/news/the-week-that-was-the-very-model-of-a-modern-major-series" target="_blank">covered the NRG circuit in the past</a> here at the Week That Was, and I want to make sure we give credit to the finalists of a series every bit as tough as the rest on the road to the Pro Tour. And for Sulaiman, it's a victory as meaningful as any that have come on the Pro Tour, which he first qualified for in 2012 after picking up the game in middle school and making his way up through the Friday Night <i>Magic</i> ranks.</p>

<p>"A few years later, I attended States for the first time for my first-ever competitive event. That transitioned into PTQs and eventually my first Pro Tour in Barcelona when I was 20," he recalled. "In the years to come when <i>Magic</i> had a huge surge in popularity and numbers at Grand Prix, I was forming groups with my friends to travel to events in the Midwest. I didn't attend my first NRG tournament until after the pandemic, but I became quickly invested, as competitive outlets for <i>Magic</i> are more scarce. I was able to accumulate enough season points to qualify for the Players Championship, and the tournament was a blast."</p>

<p>With Pro Tour Phyrexia quickly approaching (in just under a month at <a href="https://mcphiladelphia.mtgfestivals.com/content/sitebuilder/rna/mtg-festivals/global/en-us/magiccon-news/magiccon-philadelphia-the-lineup.html" target="_blank">MagicCon: Philadelphia</a>), players across the world are splitting up into testing teams and jamming games and drafts and compiling matrixes and all kinds of other high-minded preparation—even if the tournament itself sometimes comes down to whether or not you ever draw your Elesh Norn, Mother of Machines. The NRG Championship competitors attacked the multi-format tournament with the same ferocity.</p>

<p>"I prepared with friend and fellow competitor Zach Allen for the event, and I want to give a shoutout to Mack Smith for helping with the last-minute audible to Rakdos Midrange in Pioneer!" Sulaiman said. "Almost all of my matches were close and interesting as I expected nothing in a field of so many excellent players. I finished as the one seed after Day 1, with an undefeated record in Modern with Bant Control."</p>

===decklistId:Bant_Control_Raja_Sulaiman___0ceec641-b3cb-41a8-a756-5a8ef6008734===

<p>"I have almost exclusively played Azorius Control in Modern since <i>Modern Horizons 2,</i> and the archetype I was always a fan of received significant upgrades in the form of <auto-card>Prismatic Ending</auto-card>, <auto-card>Counterspell</auto-card>, <auto-card>Solitude</auto-card>, and <auto-card>Subtlety</auto-card>," Sulaiman explained. "My commitment to the deck eventually converted into success on the NRG circuit with four Top 8s in 2022, so it was fairly obvious that I wasn't going to deviate going into the championship. However, one innovation I did develop that was pivotal in taking down the tournament and catching my fellow competitors off-guard was the addition of four <auto-card>Endurance</auto-card> to the sideboard. It was a reaction to the popularity of <auto-card>Underworld Breach</auto-card> leading up to the event, and unlike more dedicated graveyard hard cards like <auto-card>Rest in Peace</auto-card>, <auto-card>Endurance</auto-card> was flexible in that it threatened to block Ragavan and <auto-card>Urza's Saga</auto-card> tokens and pressure planeswalkers while still interacting with Breach."</p>

<p>As Sulaiman put it dryly, it came as no surprise that Modern was his best format on the weekend, and it took him to a loaded Top 4 that included Jesse Robkin, Zoe Riederman and Pro Tour champion Andrew Elenbogen.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We are onto the Top 4 here at <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NRGCHAMP?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NRGCHAMP</a>!<br><br>It&#39;s down to <a href="https://twitter.com/Ajelenbogen?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Ajelenbogen</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Rizzy5S?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Rizzy5S</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/tiddypills?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@tiddypills</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/zoeried?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@zoeried</a> who will battle it out to become the 2022 NRG Series Champion.<br><br>You don&#39;t want to miss the rest of this tournament: <a href="https://t.co/u0tpWUpNWS">https://t.co/u0tpWUpNWS</a> <a href="https://t.co/g3mz89o1I8">pic.twitter.com/g3mz89o1I8</a></p>&mdash; NRG Series (@NRGSeries) <a href="https://twitter.com/NRGSeries/status/1614685484541972481?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 15, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Sulaiman's Top 4 path went through Riederman, who had also qualified for the Championship on season points. She had a host of Top 8 appearances to their name, and was piloting <auto-card>Living End</auto-card>.</p>

<p>"After splitting the first two matches, it came down to a three-game match of Modern where I was able to defeat <auto-card>Living End</auto-card> in large part due to my sideboard <auto-card>Endurance</auto-card>s," Sulaiman revealed. "In the finals I played against Jesse, and after winning the first match I quickly lost the second and found myself down a game in our final match. I was down 30-6 in life in Game 2, and things looked grim. But I was able to turn the corner with <auto-card>Sheoldred, the Apocalypse</auto-card> and win a game where I was behind almost the entire time. With game 3 for all the marbles, I was able to enact a game plan of using a lot of creature removal and leveraging my threats to become the aggressor and deal exactly lethal damage."</p>

<p>And with that, Sulaiman was the champ.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This weekend was a blast! Shoutout to NRG for putting on such an awesome tournament and series.

<p>"It was incredibly satisfying to win the event, and being able to represent and bring home a trophy to a shop (<a href="https://twitter.com/RIWHobbies" target="_blank">RIW Hobbies</a>) that has been an important fixture of my life since I was 10 years old was my favorite part of it all. I feel like I've always had a chip on my shoulder when it comes to competitive <i>Magic,</i> so whenever I get a big finish like this, it feels very vindicating," he confessed. "Pam Willoughby of RIW Hobbies has been the best sponsor a guy could ask for, and Nerd Rage Gaming ran an incredible tournament series all year long. It was really cool to see all the support from the <i>Magic</i> community throughout the weekend and reminded me that I'm part of something special that goes beyond just a hobby."</p>

<h1>Looking Ahead</h1>

<p>So what's next for the engineer from Farmington Hills? The same thing that's next for most of us: <a href="https://magic.gg/events/pro-tour-phyrexia" target="_blank">Pro Tour Phyrexia</a> in Philadelphia on Feb. 17-19.</p>

<p>"I'm also qualified for the Regional Championships in San Diego and Dallas, and I'm sure I will be attending other fun tournament series in the Midwest," Sulaiman said. "I'm excited to compete in whatever comes my way."</p>

<p>With an NRG Championship title behind him—and a long string of PT and Regional Championship appearances on the horizon—Sulaiman can finally let that chip go. He's proven himself one of the best in North America, and there's plenty more to come in 2023. The NRG circuit will kick off afresh in March after the Pro Tour, and there's regular <a href="https://magic.gg/pro-tour?section=regional-championships" target="_blank">Regional Championship Qualifiers</a> being played at a store near you.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Metagame Mentor: 10 Off-Meta Combo Decks Winning in Modern</title><link>https://magic.gg/news/metagame-mentor-10-off-meta-combo-decks-winning-in-modern</link><guid>https://magic.gg/news/metagame-mentor-10-off-meta-combo-decks-winning-in-modern</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>Hello and welcome back to Metagame Mentor, your weekly guide to the top decks and latest Constructed developments on the path to the Pro Tour. <a href="https://www.magic.gg/news/metagame-mentor-everything-to-know-about-modern-to-win-your-rcq" target="_blank">Last week</a>, I broke down the top 15 archetypes in the current Modern metagame, showcasing a diversity of play styles including aggro, midrange, control, ramp, and combo. However, the variety goes deeper, especially when it pertains to combo. Today, I'll cover the top ten off-meta combo decks that recently found success in Modern tournaments.</p>

<h1>The Modern Metagame</h1>

<p>Modern, one of the possible Constructed formats for Regional Championship Qualifiers (RCQs), is a nonrotating, 60-card format featuring cards from approximately the last 20 years. Its deep card pool enables a variety of powerful strategies. For a detailed introduction, I recommend <a href="https://www.magic.gg/news/metagame-mentor-everything-to-know-about-modern-to-win-your-rcq" target="_blank">last week's format primer</a>, which introduced the top 15 archetypes, matchups, and interactions.</p>

<p>As I wrote in that article, Izzet Murktide and Hammer Time are currently the two most prominent decks to beat. The metagame has remained relatively stable over the past month, but there are always new developments, most notably the emergence of <auto-card>Underworld Breach</auto-card> as a fair value card. This trend continued last weekend, but the overall metagame table would look strikingly similar to last week's. Instead, let's zoom in on a high-profile event.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">In the end, Bart Van Etten reigns supreme at the MOCS Showcase! Using Izzet Murktide, they bested Damian Buckley in the Finals to win $20,000 and the title of Showcase Champion - congratulations! <a href="https://t.co/1lsX24jZU2">pic.twitter.com/1lsX24jZU2</a></p>&mdash; Magic Online (@MagicOnline) <a href="https://twitter.com/MagicOnline/status/1616981546870661122?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 22, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>At last weekend's 8-player <a href="https://magic.gg/events/2022-magic-online-champions-showcase-season-3" target="_blank"><i>Magic Online</i> Champions Showcase</a>, a quarter of the field was on Domain Zoo, which put up a good showing in the Modern rounds. But in the end, in a metagame that also featured two Izzet Murktide decks, two Jeskai Breach decks, and two other decks, Izzet Murktide emerged victorious. Modern champion Bart van Etten defeated draft champion Damian Buckley in the finals, and both finalists earned an invitation to World Championship XXIX, held at MagicCon: Las Vegas on September 22–24, 2023.</p>

<p>Yet there's more to Modern than Izzet Murktide and the other popular archetypes that I covered last week.</p>

<h1>The Top 10 Off-Meta Combo Decks in Modern</h1>

<p>Looking for something different, but powerful? After sifting through thousands of successful Modern decklists from recent tournaments, I picked ten underrated combo archetypes, in no particular order, to consider.</p>

===decklistId:Tameshi_Bloom_Jack_Lynch_$20K_RCQ_at_SCG_CON_New_Jersey_January 14, 2023_e54e1b03-a2cc-40db-8ea3-c1a150da1c58===

<p>Tameshi Bloom, like all combo decks in this article, hasn't been popular lately but is still powerful enough to put up a good showing at major events. Just two weeks ago, Jack Lynch piloted this deck to a 9-4 finish at the $20K RCQ at SCG CON, missing the single-elmination playoffs by a single win.</p>

<p>The core of the deck around <auto-card>Lotus Bloom</auto-card>, which can be put onto the battlefield by <auto-card>Wargate</auto-card>. By sacrificing <auto-card>Lotus Bloom</auto-card> and repeatedly recurring it with <auto-card>Tameshi, Reality Architect</auto-card>, you can ramp up to seven mana and use <auto-card>Cultivator Colossus</auto-card> to draw half your deck. This particular list includes <auto-card>Dryad of the Ilysian Grove</auto-card> and <auto-card>Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle</auto-card> as win conditions, but other options are available. <auto-card>Eladamri's Call</auto-card> helps you consistently find the pieces of the combo while also unlocking a creature toolbox in the sideboard.</p>

===decklistId:Hardened_Scales_Davide_Patacchiola_Classic_Open_Qualifier_Trieste_January 15, 2023_c17e5b04-cc96-4e2f-ade9-71be174cd5bb===

<p>Hardened Scales can also win by attacking with aggressive creatures, but its best draws explode in a combo-like way, producing lethal damage out of thin air. For example, suppose you start the turn with <auto-card>Hardened Scales</auto-card>, <auto-card>The Ozolith</auto-card>, <auto-card>Power Depot</auto-card>, and three other lands on the battlefield. Your opponent is at 16 life, and you control no creatures. However, if your hand contains <auto-card>Arcbound Ravager</auto-card> and <auto-card>Walking Ballista</auto-card>, then that's lethal! To accomplish this, <auto-card>Arcbound Ravager</auto-card> absorbs the +1/+1 counter on <auto-card>Power Depot</auto-card>, then devours <auto-card>Power Depot</auto-card> and finally itself. <auto-card>Hardened Scales</auto-card> adds an extra +1/+1 counter every time, and <auto-card>The Ozolith</auto-card> doubles modular's effectiveness. The end result is a 16/16 <auto-card>Walking Ballista</auto-card>. If you add <auto-card>Zabaz, the Glimmerwasp</auto-card>, a gigantic 30/30 <auto-card>Walking Ballista</auto-card> would have even been possible!</p>

<p>By exploiting these synergies, Davide Patacchiola won the 137-player Classic Qualifier Trieste two weeks ago, earning an invitation to the European Championship. This Regional Championship (to be held in Athens, Greece on June 10-11 in the Pioneer format) marks the next step on the organized play pyramid. Top performers at that Regional Championship will earn a qualification for the Pro Tour at MagicCon: Barcelona on July 28-30. Yet the path to the Pro Tour can begin with a spicy Modern deck.</p>

===decklistId:Shift_to_Light_Vito_Tomasicchio_Grand_Open_Qualifier_Trieste_January 14, 2023_b8695e56-86ac-4615-b0bd-601b1ca01441===

<p>Vito Tomasicchio recently finished an impressive 9th place at the Grand Open Qualifier Trieste, narrowly missing the single-elimination playoffs on tiebreakers. His 11-3-1 record was still more than enough to secure him a European Championship qualification.</p>

<p>In his deck, which I've come to call Shift to Light, the key card is <auto-card>Bring to Light</auto-card>. With a five-color mana base, it transforms into a tutor that can immediately cast the card it finds. One noteworthy tutor target is <auto-card>Valki, God of Lies</auto-card>, since the rules allow you to cast the seven-mana <auto-card>Tibalt, Cosmic Impostor</auto-card> with <auto-card>Bring to Light</auto-card>. However, the most important tutor target in the deck is <auto-card>Scapeshift</auto-card>. When you sacrifice seven lands, you can search for <auto-card>Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle</auto-card> and six Mountains, roasting your opponent for 18 damage. This turns <auto-card>Bring to Light</auto-card> into an unstoppable a one-card late-game win condition.</p>

===decklistId:Gruul_Storm_CWS_MTGO_Challenge_January 14, 2023_393d8b87-522e-46e7-9241-957cc047c2ee===

<p>Gruul Storm, recently taken to a six-win run by <i>Magic Online</i> player CWS in a Challenge event, is a powerful combo strategy that exploits the explosive synergy between <auto-card>Underworld Breach</auto-card> and <auto-card>Dragon's Rage Channeler</auto-card>. The Gruul colors unlock <auto-card>Goblin Anarchomancer</auto-card>, who turns <auto-card>Pyretic Ritual</auto-card>, <auto-card>Desperate Ritual</auto-card>, and <auto-card>Manamorphose</auto-card> into efficient mana producers. They allow you to cast numerous spells in a single turn, after which a pair of <auto-card>Grapeshot</auto-card>s will finish the job.</p>

<p>There are two advantages to playing green instead of blue. First, you gain access to powerful sideboard options such as <auto-card>Veil of Summer</auto-card>, which counters <auto-card>Spell Pierce</auto-card> and <auto-card>Thoughtseize</auto-card>. Second, <auto-card>Goblin Anarchomancer</auto-card> reduces the cost of <auto-card>Underworld Breach</auto-card>, which is something that <auto-card>Baral, Chief of Compliance</auto-card> or <auto-card>Goblin Electromancer</auto-card> could never do.</p>

===decklistId:Dredge_Sodeq_MTGO_Challenge_January 8, 2023_19ca490c-d9f7-4c06-93fe-33f9f6325bb1===

<p>Dredge has been one of the most powerful mechanics in Modern since the format's inception—something the designers were keenly aware of when they placed <auto-card>Golgari Grave-Troll</auto-card> on the initial ban list in 2011. Although the card was unbanned in 2015, it was banned once again in 2017, making it the only card in Modern to get banned twice. Throughout the years, Dredge has been a top-tier deck in Modern, generally using <auto-card>Stinkweed Imp</auto-card>, <auto-card>Golgari Thug</auto-card>, and <auto-card>Darkblast</auto-card> in lieu of <auto-card>Golgari Grave-Troll</auto-card>, but its popularity had waned in recent years. Recently, however, Sodeq put the graveyard-abusing archetype back on the map with a second-place finish in an MTGO Challenge event.</p>

<p>Two key cards in his deck are <auto-card>Thrilling Discovery</auto-card> or <auto-card>Cathartic Reunion</auto-card>, which not only put dredge cards into the graveyard but also allow you to mill yourself immediately. Ideally, you mill <auto-card>Narcomoeba</auto-card> and <auto-card>Prized Amalgam</auto-card>, which will return to the battlefield without having to invest any mana. Another card that you hope to mill is <auto-card>Creeping Chill</auto-card>, which can return <auto-card>Silversmote Ghoul</auto-card> to the battlefield. Once you escape <auto-card>Ox of Agonas</auto-card>, which allows you to put dredge cards into your graveyard while triggering any <auto-card>Prized Amalgam</auto-card> already there, victory will be almost assured. However, anti-graveyard cards like <auto-card>Leyline of the Void</auto-card> or <auto-card>Endurance</auto-card> keep this deck in check.</p>

===decklistId:Asmo_Portal_MrFringe89_$20K_RCQ_at_SCG_CON_New_Jersey_January 14, 2023_d1212725-08f8-4591-b962-1b91ef7c7e53===

<p>At the $20K RCQ at SCG CON two weeks ago, MrFringe89 took a deck that I dubbed Asmo Portal to a 9-3-1 finish, one win short of making it to the single-elimination playoffs. The appetizing strategy marries two combo angles. The first revolves around <auto-card>The Underworld Cookbook</auto-card> + <auto-card>Ovalchase Daredevil</auto-card> engine, which creates a steady stream of Food tokens. With those tokens, you can not only activate <auto-card>Asmoranomardicadaistinaculdacar</auto-card> but also cast <auto-card>Trash for Treasure</auto-card>, which spearheads the second combo angle.</p>

<p>After you've put <auto-card>Portal to Phyrexia</auto-card> or <auto-card>Sundering Titan</auto-card> into your graveyard, typically via <auto-card>Goblin Engineer</auto-card> or <auto-card>Scrapwork Mutt</auto-card>, <auto-card>Trash for Treasure</auto-card> will put a game-winning artifact onto the battlefield for the low cost of three mana. The artifact-swapping sorcery has been Modern-legal since the format's inception, but <auto-card>Scrapwork Mutt</auto-card> and <auto-card>Portal to Phyrexia</auto-card> from <i>The Brothers’ War</i> may have been the missing pieces. The new set also introduced <auto-card>Phyrexian Dragon Engine</auto-card>, whose card draw ability will trigger when you return it with <auto-card>Goblin Engineer</auto-card>. With all these new synergies, this novel brew deserves consideration.</p>

===decklistId:Belcher_TheManLand_MTGO_Super_Qualifier_December 26, 2022_cfb4a278-9edf-4946-b31e-beddad9d7b0a===

<p>Belcher is a combo deck with zero land cards. As a result, an activation of <auto-card>Goblin Charbelcher</auto-card> will deal damage to your opponent equal to the number of cards in your library, which is generally enough to win the game. To reach seven mana, the deck uses numerous modal double-faced cards alongside a smattering of rituals. For example, after a tapped <auto-card>Valakut Awakening</auto-card> on turn one, you might play <auto-card>Shatterskull Smashing</auto-card> untapped on turn two, chain <auto-card>Desperate Ritual</auto-card> into <auto-card>Pyretic Ritual</auto-card> into <auto-card>Irencrag Feat</auto-card>, and win the game with <auto-card>Goblin Charbelcher</auto-card>.</p>

<p>Belcher also gets to exploit <auto-card>Recross the Paths</auto-card> as a tutor that allows you to stack your entire deck. Since the deck contains zero land cards, you'll reveal your entire library and subsequently order it in any way you desire. Another benefit of using Belcher over other combo strategies is that it doesn't use the graveyard, so it dodges graveyard hate. MTGO player TheManLand recently took the deck to eight wins in a Super Qualifier, which was close to the amount needed to earn a Regional Championship qualification in that event.</p>

===decklistId:Devoted_Druid_Steven_Borakove_$20K_RCQ_at_SCG_CON_New_Jersey_January 14, 2023_4bfc39ed-5c29-4989-961d-5f8a41eb4d97===

<p>Devoted Druid has enabled numerous combos over the years, but the one involving <auto-card>Vizier of Remedies</auto-card> is the most prominent and mana-efficient. <auto-card>Vizier of Remedies</auto-card> effectively allows you to untap <auto-card>Devoted Druid</auto-card> for free, allowing to you to add infinite green mana. Using this mana, you can win the game with <auto-card>Walking Ballista</auto-card>, <auto-card>Viridian Longbow</auto-card>, or <auto-card>Finale of Devastation</auto-card>.</p>

<p><auto-card>Eladamri's Call</auto-card> helps find your combo pieces, and <auto-card>Stoneforge Mystic</auto-card> can fetch <auto-card>Luxior, Giada's Gift</auto-card> as an alternative way to generate infinite mana with <auto-card>Devoted Druid</auto-card>. Such tutors are essential to build a consistent and competitive combo deck. Steven Borakove took it to a Top 8 finish at the $20K RCQ at SCG CON two weeks ago, one win short of clinching a Regional Championship qualification.</p>

===decklistId:CopyCat_Mochizuki_Masaki_The_22nd_God_of_Modern_January 21, 2023_c4d3db8e-08fa-4077-9da6-560bff311479===

<p>CopyCat is a combo strategy that uses <auto-card>Saheeli Rai</auto-card> to create infinite hasty copies of <auto-card>Felidar Guardian</auto-card>, each blinking the planeswalker to unlock another activation. This game-winning combo, which resulted in <auto-card>Felidar Guardian</auto-card>'s ban from Standard in 2017 and the formation of the Play Design team, remains available in Modern today. Mochizuki Masaki recently took it to a Top 4 finish at a 193-player tournament in Tokyo.</p>

<p>Masaki slotted the combo in an otherwise straightforward Four-Color Omnath shell. This makes sense because if you draw only one piece of the combo, then you can use <auto-card>Saheeli Rai</auto-card> or <auto-card>Felidar Guardian</auto-card> to blink or copy <auto-card>Solitude</auto-card> or <auto-card>Fury</auto-card> for value. In this deck, <auto-card>Oath of Nissa</auto-card> not only improves consistency but also helps you dodge <auto-card>Blood Moon</auto-card>.</p>

===decklistId:Urza_ThopterSword_gyyby297_MTGO_Super_Qualifier_December 26, 2022_ce2ec3c2-9452-479d-b6ae-1d553340dbbf===

<p>Urza ThopterSword revolves around the synergy between Thopter Founrdry and <auto-card>Sword of the Meek</auto-card>. After sacrificing <auto-card>Sword of the Meek</auto-card>, the created Thopter token brings back the Sword, allowing you to create a Thopter for every mana you have. The addition of <auto-card>Urza, Lord High Artificer</auto-card>, which can tap both <auto-card>Sword of the Meek</auto-card> and the Thopter token for mana, results in infinite Thopters, infinite life, infinite mana, and infinite Urza activations.</p>

<p>Using this game-winning combo, supported by <auto-card>Stoneforge Mystic</auto-card> and <auto-card>Ingenious Smith</auto-card>, MTGO player gyyby297 recently reached seven wins in a Super Qualifier. Solid results like these exemplify the abundance of under-the-radar Modern decks capable of good performances, especially when piloted by an experienced player.</p>

<h1>Looking Ahead</h1>

<p>If you're eager to start your own competitive tabletop <i>Magic</i> journey, you can find Regional Championship Qualifiers (RCQs) near you via the <a href="https://locator.wizards.com/search?searchType=magic-events&amp;tag=regional_championship_qualifier&amp;query=Los%20Angeles,%20CA,%20USA&amp;distance=100&amp;page=1&amp;sort=date&amp;sortDirection=asc" target="_blank">event Locator</a> or your <a href="https://magic.gg/pro-tour?section=regional-championships#pro-tour" target="_blank">regional organizer's website</a>. RCQs can take place in Modern, Pioneer, Standard, or Limited—including the prerelease at <a href="https://scgcon.starcitygames.com/event/scg-con-indianapolis-2023/" target="_blank">SCG CON Indianapolis</a>.

Officially named Pro Tour Phyrexia, it invites a few hundred of the world's very best Magic: the Gathering players to compete in a three-day tournament featuring a $500,00 prize pool. The formats are <i>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</i> Booster Draft in the morning of Friday and Saturday, and then Pioneer Constructed for five rounds afterward each of those days. Pioneer is also the Top 8 format on Sunday as the final remaining players compete to see who will take home the prestigious title and first-place trophy.</p>

<p>For other competitive players looking for an opportunity to show their skills, MagicCon: Philadelphia will also host two <i>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</i> Sealed Pro Tour Qualifiers, each of which qualify the four top finishers for Pro Tour March of the Machine, held at MagicCon: Minneapolis on May 5–7. MagicCon: Philadelphia also features four Secret Lair Showdowns in the Pioneer format, where players compete for coveted Secret Lair prizes, including an alternate-art Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer and a very special variant on Brainstorm.

	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>For the Arena Championship 2 there are no draws, intentional or otherwise, during the Swiss rounds. Players are expected to play until a winner is declared, either via traditional means of ending a match if Traditional Historic or Traditional Limited, or via a player's time bank running out.</p>

<p>Additionally, concessions of matches that have not reached a clear, natural conclusion are not allowed in this tournament. All competitors are expected to play to the best of their abilities to reach a point of natural conclusion for each match.</p>

<p>The following are acceptable examples in which a player may concede the game:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A player is being attacked for lethal damage and sees no means of surviving the turn.</li>
	<li>A player has reasoned that they have no lines of play in which they can win the current game and wishes to concede to conserve their time bank.</li>
	<li>Players have been instructed to concede games in an admin-ruled match remake due to a compromised match that was restarted.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following are unacceptable examples in which a player should not concede:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A player has not played a single turn of a game.</li>
	<li>A player is choosing to concede when it is clear they have an advantage.</li>
	<li>A player chooses to mulligan to virtually no cards as a workaround to not technically concede, despite drawing multiple playable hands.</li>
</ul>

<p>In general, the goal of this rule is ensuring that matches in this tournament are decided by players completing matches of <i>Magic: The Gathering Arena</i> in best-of-three Traditional Historic and Traditional Limited formats and are not influenced by outside motivations. Players that violate this rule with the intent that goes against the philosophy of this rule may be subject to penalties as defined in the Digital Magic Tournament Rules.</p>

Thousands of players across the world competed to qualify for and then play in Regional Championships that feed the Pro Tour in 2023. It's been a wild ride we've covered here at The Week That Was, and it's felt a lot like the old days of week-in and week-out meaningful results. And I thought there might be a bit of a lull before Pro Tour Phyrexia next month at <a href="https://mcphiladelphia.mtgfestivals.com" target="_blank">MagicCon: Philadelphia</a>.</p>

<p>I was wrong.</p>

<p>Can I interest you in not one, but <i>three</i> high-level tournaments last weekend?</p>

<p>I've been talking to winners week after week, and it's all leading to the Pro Tour next month. There's several events I want to wrap up this week, and let's start with the one that had my favorite deck of all time in the finals.</p>

<h1>Steiner On Top in Trieste</h1>

<p>Nearly 400 players showed up to battle things out in Modern at the Grand Open Qualifier in Trieste.</p>

<p>Competitive <i>Magic</i> over the past few months has been largely focused on Pioneer. It was the format of all the dozen Regional Championships that capped off 2022, and it will be the format of the first PT at Pro Tour Phyrexia in Philadelphia later this month (you can get tickets to MagicCon <a href="https://mcphiladelphia.mtgfestivals.com/en-us.html" target="_blank">here</a>).</p>

<p>But this last weekend belong to Modern. Ever since the format debuted in 2011 at Pro Tour Philadelphia (and brought us an <a href="https://magic.gg/news/the-week-that-was-miranda-masters-modern" target="_blank">Infinity Faeries victory</a>), it's been a fan favorite and I've been playing Merfolk since that day. The deck gave me my first major Top 8 and as anyone who is a longtime reader knows, I never miss a chance to bring it up.</p>

<p>So the finals of LMS Trieste was dang near perfect: <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/268484" target="_blank">Merfolk</a> in the hands of Micheleb vs. Stefan Steiner on Temur Rhinos.</p>

<magic-cards>
  574555
  Lord of Atlantis
  Violent Outburst
  Crashing Footfalls
</magic-cards>

<p>And—spoiler—while it didn't work out very well for the fish in the end, the tournament demonstrated everything players have come to love about Modern over the last decade, such as <i>eight different decks in the Top 8</i>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Mono-White Hammer</li>
	<li>Izzet Murktide</li>
	<li>Jeskai Breach</li>
	<li>Izzet Prowess</li>
	<li>Five-Color Creativity</li>
	<li>Merfolk</li>
	<li>Five-Color Zoo</li>
	<li>Temur Rhinos</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://magic.gg/news/metagame-mentor-everything-to-know-about-modern-to-win-your-rcq" target="_blank">Check out Frank's column this week for all the up-to-the-minute details for Modern</a> but this is the gold standard of diversity when it comes to nonrotating formats. There are certainly the current "best decks" (Rhinos, Murktide, Hammer) but let's be real: no one besides me expects to see Merfolk in the Top 8, and absolutely no one expected to see <auto-card>Wild Nacatl</auto-card> make a reappearance in major Top 8. (Shoutout to Manuel Danninger for the <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/269103" target="_blank">Zoo brew</a>.)</p>

<p>These breakthroughs are no small feat; the tournament is littered with the names of the best players in Europe, including a Top 16 appearance by Andrea Mengucci. But the day belonged to Steiner, who went 11-3-1 in the Swiss rounds with the latest iteration of cascade. The powerful and consistent deck may struggle against a resolved <auto-card>Chalice of the Void</auto-card>, but it has the tools and speed to keep up with anything in the format, and Steiner put on a masterclass with the deck on his way to victory.</p>

<h1>Busy Modern Weekend in North America</h1>

<p>While Steiner was dominating in Italy, the stakes were higher than ever across the pond for the sixteen competitors in the NRG Series Championship. The exclusive event was the culmination of the yearlong NRG season, and featured the best players on the circuit – not to mention in North America.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">After an amazing year of Magic with 28 events and over 2,000 players giving it their all, we&#39;re down to our final event and just 16 players remain.<br><br>Let&#39;s give a huge congratulations to the field for the 2022 NRG Series Championship 🏆<br><br>Be sure to tune in January 14-15, 2023! <a href="https://t.co/AZONxx6nlE">pic.twitter.com/AZONxx6nlE</a></p>&mdash; NRG Series (@NRGSeries) <a href="https://twitter.com/NRGSeries/status/1602499824900636672?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 13, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>It was a mixed-format tournament, but the 16 assembled players are skilled in any format in front of them. That includes Raja Sulaiman, the NRG Series veteran who qualified for the Championship as a season points leader. The 31-year-old has five NRG Series Top 8s to his name along with two wins in those appearances. He first broke through at Players Tour Phoenix in 2020, posting a Top 16 finish, and has been on steady climb since.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NRGChamp?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NRGChamp</a> Player Spotlight: <a href="https://twitter.com/Rizzy5S?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Rizzy5S</a> <br><br>Raja qualified as one of two point leaders at the end of Season 3! <a href="https://t.co/8O04EoSH9A">pic.twitter.com/8O04EoSH9A</a></p>&mdash; NRG Series (@NRGSeries) <a href="https://twitter.com/NRGSeries/status/1613618577097080833?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 12, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>That culminated last weekend, as he cruised to the Top 4 and then the finals, where he squared off against Jesse Robkin, who qualified for the event after a <a href="https://magic.gg/news/the-week-that-was-the-very-model-of-a-modern-major-series" target="_blank">memorable season of her own</a> on the NRG Series circuit. It was Sulaiman who took down the ultimate match, and he punched his ticket as the latest NRG Series champion.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The NRG Series has found its new Champion. <a href="https://twitter.com/Rizzy5S?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Rizzy5S</a> <a href="https://t.co/YlCEw89gvl">pic.twitter.com/YlCEw89gvl</a></p>&mdash; NRG Series (@NRGSeries) <a href="https://twitter.com/NRGSeries/status/1614789464303468545?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 16, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Sulaiman wasn't the only player conquering tournaments in America, or demonstrating a mastery of Modern. At the SCGCON Modern tournaments in New Jersey, players continued to push the format in several high-level events and added an entirely different set of decks to Top 8s that included Rakdos Midrange, Amulet Titan, Four-Color Elementals and even old-school decks Azorius Control and Eldrazi Tron.</p>

<p>David Nunez <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/MasterNunez/status/1614763745653260288" target="_blank">won the $20k event</a> with Izzet Prowess, while Adam Snook found victory in the $5k with the relatively recent Rakdos Midrange brew that comes with one simple trick that opponent hate: its key creatures (<auto-card>Grief</auto-card>, <auto-card>Fury</auto-card>) evoke for free and then come right back thanks to cards like <auto-card>Feign Death</auto-card>, <auto-card>Undying Malice</auto-card> and <auto-card>Malakir Rebirth</auto-card>.</p>

<p>Players have experimented with the strategy ever since the evoke elementals debuted in <i>Modern Horizons 2</i>, and in Snook's list the deck seems to be closer to its final form than ever before. For the eight-time Pro Tour veteran, the Rakdos deck is everything he loves about <i>Magic</i>.</p>

<p>"I definitely lean toward any deck that can play <auto-card>Thoughtseize</auto-card>," the Upton, Massachusetts native explained. "Sometimes that's to my detriment, as it's not always well-positioned in the format. But for Modern and Pioneer, Rakdos is currently one of the best decks. I didn't make Day 2 of the main event, but I had much better luck on Sunday: I played a lot more turn one <auto-card>Grief</auto-card>s."</p>

<p>Hand disruption is as potent as ever in Modern, and it carried Snook to an undefeated record in the swiss rounds of the event. He entered the Top 8 with momentum and was able to grind out games against Amulet Titan with his maindeck <auto-card>Blood Moon</auto-card>s and then the mirror in three long games.</p>

<p>That led him to a finals matchup with Robert Seder, a New York player who has faced off against Snook many times over the years in high-level events.</p>

<p>"Like me, he also sticks to a certain type of deck, except his choice is Control," Snook explained. "We most recently battled at the Regional Championship in Atlanta, Azorius Control vs. Rakdos Midrange, and he won that time.</p>

<p>"But I got my revenge on Sunday. My last play was a draw step <auto-card>Thoughtseize</auto-card> that I cast off his <auto-card>Teferi, Time Raveler</auto-card> that I had stolen with Ragavan earlier. The true Azorius versus Rakdos story."</p>

===decklistId:Adam_Snook's_Rakdos_Midrange____0d68c6b1-d6f7-40a5-901e-784e7a5554c2===

<p>You don't find many finishes more unique than that one. That's why the Modern world has loved the format over the past decade, and for Snook it was a breakthrough a very long time coming.</p>

<p>"The thing I'm most excited about is having a trophy!" he explained. "I started playing <i>Magic</i> when I got it as a birthday gift at 8 years old. I'm 33 now so I've been playing for a while. By the time I was 11 I was playing in the Junior Super Series consistently, and won when I was 13. In 2012, I got back into <i>Magic</i> and made the Top 8 of Grand Prix Baltimore alongside friends Dave Shiels and Matt Costa. From that point, I was hooked on competitive <i>Magic</i>. Playing in Grand Prix all year with friends is my favorite memory playing <i>Magic</i>, and I met some of my best friends and groomsmen in my wedding through the game."</p>

<p>It's been a long road to a trophy for Snook, but after last weekend he enters the rest of the 2023 season with momentum and a giant <i>Magic</i> bucket list item crossed off.</p>

<p>"I've won 7 PTQs and done pretty well in a lot of events, but hardware has eluded me so it'll be nice to have something to show," he explained. "At this point I'm qualified for Regional Championships in San Diego and now Dallas, so next up will be preparing for those events and using <i>Magic Online</i> to practice. The Pro Tour is the reason I play <i>Magic</i>, and playing in another one of those will certainly be my goal for this year."</p>

<h1>Looking Ahead</h1>

<p>There's more Modern coming, as the <a href="https://magic.gg/news/2022-magic-online-champions-showcase-season-3-viewers-guide" target="_blank">2023 Season 3 <i>Magic Online</i> Champions Showcase</a> this weekend will feature the Modern format as <i>Magic Online</i> experts play for a $70,000 prize pool.

Today, we'll take a look at the top 15 archetypes in the current Modern metagame and discuss what happened in last weekend's events. Modern is one of the possible Constructed formats for Regional Championship Qualifiers (RCQs) and this article can act as your one-stop shop to acquaint yourself with the format.</p>

<h1>The Modern Metagame</h1>

<p>Modern, <a href="https://articles.starcitygames.com/magic-the-gathering/select/pro-tour-philadelphia-and-the-birth-of-modern-an-oral-history/" target="_blank">created in 2011</a>, is a nonrotating, 60-card format that allows expansion sets, core sets, and Modern Horizons sets from <i>Eight Edition</i> forward, save for cards on the <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/banned-restricted-list" target="_blank">banned list</a>. Compared to Standard and Pioneer, it has a deeper card pool, features more complex card interactions, and enables a larger diversity of strategies.</p>

<p>To grasp the latest Modern developments, I analyzed over 1,000 decklists from large competitive events over the past few weeks. Specifically, I used all available <i>Magic Online</i> decklists from scheduled Modern events held from December 26, 2022 through January 17, 2023. In addition, I used Top 8 decklists from the <a href="https://twitter.com/CardMonsterGame/status/1612506763684634643" target="_blank">RCQ at Card Monster Games</a> and the <a href="https://www.igmdm.com/torneo-medio-wpnq-modern/" target="_blank">RCQ at Checkpoint Gallarate</a>, as well as all MTG Melee decklists with positive net wins from the <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Tournament/View/13431" target="_blank">Grand Open Qualifier</a> and <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Tournament/View/13432" target="_blank">Classic Qualifier</a> at LMS Trieste and the <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Tournament/View/13194" target="_blank">Modern $20K RCQ</a>, and <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Tournament/View/13196" target="_blank">Modern $5K RCQ</a> at SCG CON New Jersey. These tabletop events provided dozens of Regional Championship invites, with the biggest events drawing hundreds of players to compete for large prizes.</p>

<p>To provide a metagame snapshot that combines popularity and performance, I assigned an archetype label to each deck and awarded a number of points equal to the deck's net wins, i.e., its number of match wins minus losses. For example, a deck that went 5–1 in the Swiss followed by a loss in the quarterfinals was assigned three points. The sum of these numbers for every archetype yields its record-weighted metagame share, which represents its share of total net wins. It may be interpreted as a winner's metagame that you can expect to see at the top tables.</p>

<p>In this table, each archetype name hyperlinks to a well-performing, representative decklist, and the arrows represent the biggest changes compared to <a href="https://www.magic.gg/news/metagame-mentor-standard-and-modern-with-the-brothers-war" target="_blank">my metagame roundup from early December</a>. Despite small fluctuations, the metagame has remained relatively stable and diverse. The diversity is evidenced by the Top 8 at the Grand Open Qualifier at LMS Trieste, which featured eight different archetypes.</p>

The number of competitively viable Modern archetypes remains enormous, and deck familiarity is a significant success factor. My advice for navigating the Modern format is to invest time in mastering your preferred deck. A skilled player who is well-versed in their deck's interactions and matchup strategies can win with almost everything.</p>

<p>The defining staples of the format (more specifically, the most-played non-land cards across all main decks and sideboards) were <auto-card>Lightning Bolt</auto-card>; <auto-card>Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer</auto-card>; <auto-card>Spell Pierce</auto-card>; <auto-card>Expressive Iteration</auto-card>; <auto-card>Mishra's Bauble</auto-card>; <auto-card>Unholy Heat</auto-card>; and <auto-card>Fury</auto-card>. In Modern, it's essential to have a solid plan for dealing with the ubiquitous turn-one play of <auto-card>Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer</auto-card>. The legendary Monkey Pirate can be blocked, destroyed, or overpowered, but Modern players should expect to face Ragavan frequently.</p>

<p>The most notable metagame development over the past month is the emergence of <auto-card>Underworld Breach</auto-card> as a fair value card. As more and more players are discovering, you don't necessarily need a combo with <auto-card>Grinding Station</auto-card>. Recasting <auto-card>Mishra's Bauble</auto-card> or <auto-card>Lightning Bolt</auto-card> several times can already yield a game-winning advantage, especially when you're triggering <auto-card>Dragon's Rage Channeler</auto-card> along the way. For example, David Nunez' <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/267486" target="_blank">Izzet Prowess</a> list that won the $20K RCQ at SCG CON New Jersey featured two copies of <auto-card>Underworld Breach</auto-card>, and other players have found success with the card in decks such as <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/268827" target="_blank">Grixis Shadow</a> or <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/268405" target="_blank">Izzet Murktide</a>. Some <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/269107" target="_blank">Jeskai Breach</a> versions have even dropped the <auto-card>Grinding Station</auto-card> combo entirely. This shift is leading to a convergence of Jeskai Breach and Izzet Murktide, which is a intriguing development to watch.</p>

<h1>The Top 15 Modern Deck Archetypes</h1>

<p>To take a closer look at the 15 archetypes with the highest record-weighted metagame share, I've used a decklist aggregation algorithm that takes into account the popularity and performance of individual card choices.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Izzet_Murktide____66e895f3-2c19-4783-acf2-0d4774f1710b===

<p>Izzet Murktide, with a 13.9% share of the record-weighted metagame, is a powerful archetype that combines cheap cantrips, efficient interaction, and powerful threats. The card advantage and velocity provided by <auto-card>Expressive Iteration</auto-card>, which quickly turns <auto-card>Murktide Regent</auto-card> into a two-mana 8/8 flier, gives it an edge against other midrange decks such as Rakdos Undying. The density of card draw also means that you'll see your sideboard cards more frequently, which helps to improve most matchups post-board. However, due to its reliance on damage-based removal, Izzet Murktide can struggle against creatures equipped with <auto-card>Colossus Hammer</auto-card>.</p>

<p>When playing against Izzet Murktide, it's important to keep in mind that they will likely have <auto-card>Counterspell</auto-card> and <auto-card>Spell Pierce</auto-card> in their deck. If your opponent is conspicuously holding a single blue mana open, it may be better to cast a creature spell instead. Another thing to remember is that <auto-card>Ledger Shredder</auto-card> makes double-spelling less appealing, so be sure to sequence your spells in a way that avoids granting free connive triggers. Finally, if you're not playing Ragavan yourself, then be prepared for <auto-card>Blood Moon</auto-card> after sideboard. Make sure to fetch basic lands quickly to avoid getting locked out of the game.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Hammer_Time____8ae7f896-23bf-4164-b436-43643e02a0ec===

<p>Hammer Time, with a 11.6% share of the winner's metagame, treats the metagame like a nail. The main goal is to cheat the equip cost on <auto-card>Colossus Hammer</auto-card> with the help of <auto-card>Sigarda's Aid</auto-card> or <auto-card>Puresteel Paladin</auto-card>. A turn-two kill is even possible with the right opening hand: <auto-card>Sigarda's Aid</auto-card> and <auto-card>Ornithopter</auto-card> on turn one, followed by double <auto-card>Colossus Hammer</auto-card> on turn two. However, turn three or turn four kills are more realistic, especially when relying on cards such as <auto-card>Urza's Saga</auto-card> and <auto-card>Stoneforge Mystic</auto-card> to find the Hammer.</p>

<p>Hammer Time is well-equipped to defeat decks that rely on damage-based removal, such as Burn, Izzet Murktide, or Rhinos. However, due to its lack of interaction, it can struggle against combo decks such as Yawgmoth, Living End, and Amulet Titan, especially when they add <auto-card>Force of Vigor</auto-card> after sideboard. The most prominent version of Hammer Time features a small blue splash for <auto-card>Spell Pierce</auto-card>, which improves the combo matchups, but it also makes the deck more vulnerable to <auto-card>Blood Moon</auto-card>. Hammer Time can also be built in mono-white or with a green splash for <auto-card>Haywire Mite</auto-card>.</p>

<p>When playing against this deck, it's important to be aware of the interaction between <auto-card>Colossus Hammer</auto-card> and <auto-card>Inkmoth Nexus</auto-card>. When Nexus becomes equipped with Hammer, it loses flying, but if its animation ability is activated again, Nexus will regain flying, so a ground-based chump blocker may not save you. Another interaction to keep in mind is that <auto-card>Blood Moon</auto-card> doesn't just turn off <auto-card>Urza's Saga</auto-card>—it kills it. Indeed, it turns into a Mountain Saga without chapter abilities and will be sacrificed as a state-based action.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Indomitable_Creativity____76f9cd7d-c6f1-4c49-a0a1-31a14dffbb1e===

<p>Indomitable Creativity, with a 8.4% share of the record-weighted metagame, is a combo deck that aims to put Archon of Creativity onto the battlefield by using the namesake card in combination with <auto-card>Dwarven Mine</auto-card> tokens. The deck's ability to use any fetch land to grab <auto-card>Dwarven Mine</auto-card> makes it acts like a one-card combo. In recent weeks, a robust Temur version with <auto-card>Mana Leak</auto-card> and <auto-card>Burst Lightning</auto-card> has performed well, but the most popular version remains five-color with <auto-card>Leyline Binding</auto-card>. You may also sometimes encounter the card <auto-card>Indomitable Creativity</auto-card> in Jund Reanimator, a distinct archetype whose primary plan is to put Archon of Creativity onto the battlefield with <auto-card>Persist</auto-card>.</p>

<p>When playing against these decks, make sure to board in <auto-card>Orvar, the All-Form</auto-card> if you have it. When you discard Orvar to an <auto-card>Archon of Cruelty</auto-card> trigger, you can create a copy of the Archon, forcing them to sacrifice their Archon. You then untap, attack, and get another Archon trigger. It's a powerful way to turn the tables against this deck.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Rakdos_Undying____baa73fa1-62a1-4579-b0fa-b507e4a0a2ec===

<p>Rakdos Undying, with a 7.8% share of the winner's metagame, aims to evoke <auto-card>Grief</auto-card> of <auto-card>Fury</auto-card> on turn one and return it to the battlefield via <auto-card>Feign Death</auto-card> or <auto-card>Undying Malice</auto-card>. With <auto-card>Grief</auto-card>, you can discard your opponent's <auto-card>Lightning Bolt</auto-card> or <auto-card>Spell Pierce</auto-card> with the evoke trigger still on the stack, leaving them without an answer when <auto-card>Feign Death</auto-card> or <auto-card>Undying Malice</auto-card> produces a 4/3 menace with another discard attached. With <auto-card>Fury</auto-card>, the combo produces a 4/4 double striker on turn one. These powerful plays can leave opponents feeling as though they were scammed out of playing a fair game.</p>

<p>Rakdos Undying's midrange shell, which includes <auto-card>Thoughtseize</auto-card>, <auto-card>Blood Moon</auto-card>, and other interaction, makes it well-suited to defeat combo decks such as Yawgmoth, Living End, and Amulet Titan. However, discard spells can't answer the top of the opponent's deck, so it can struggle against decks with a large amount of consistency and redundancy, such as Izzet Murktide and Rhinos.</p>

<p>When playing against this deck, it's essential to keep in mind that they usually have main deck <auto-card>Blood Moon</auto-card>, so make sure to fetch basic lands when you can. Rakdos Undying is one of the most potent <auto-card>Blood Moon</auto-card> decks in the format, as it can use <auto-card>Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer</auto-card> to cast it as early as turn two, and it can pitch <auto-card>Blood Moon</auto-card> to <auto-card>Fury</auto-card> or <auto-card>Seasoned Pyromancer</auto-card> in matchups where it's not effective.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Jeskai_Breach____ef01f418-1b62-4740-876c-63b14f303819===

<p>Jeskai Breach, with a 7.5% share of the record-weighted metagame, is slowly evolving into an Izzet Murktide deck that utilizes <auto-card>Underworld Breach</auto-card> instead of <auto-card>Murktide Regent</auto-card>. While some players still cling to the traditional <auto-card>Grinding Station</auto-card> combo, the archetype is branching out in various directions. Some players are experimenting with Temur builds that incorporate <auto-card>Wrenn and Six</auto-card> instead of <auto-card>Teferi, Time Raveler</auto-card>, while others have dropped the combo angle altogether.</p>

<p>Indeed, the aggregate list no longer includes cards like <auto-card>Grinding Station</auto-card>; <auto-card>Mox Amber</auto-card>; <auto-card>Emry, <auto-card>Lurker</auto-card> of the Loch</auto-card>; or <auto-card>Urza's Saga</auto-card>. Instead, it relies on an assortment of fair cards, such as <auto-card>Dragon's Rage Channeler</auto-card>, <auto-card>Spell Pierce</auto-card>, <auto-card>Lightning Bolt</auto-card>, <auto-card>Consider</auto-card>, and <auto-card>Spirebluff Canal</auto-card>. In these builds, <auto-card>Underworld Breach</auto-card> functions as a value card, allowing players to recast cards like <auto-card>Mishra's Bauble</auto-card> or <auto-card>Lightning Bolt</auto-card> multiple times while <auto-card>Dragon's Rage Channeler</auto-card> helps to fuel the escape cost.</p>

<p>When playing against this deck, it's important to remember not to sideboard in too many anti-enchantment or anti-graveyard cards. Cards like <auto-card>Force of Vigor</auto-card> or <auto-card>Unlicensed Hearse</auto-card> won't be useful if your opponent is attacking you with creatures like Ragavan or <auto-card>Ledger Shredder</auto-card> and they don't even have <auto-card>Grinding Station</auto-card>; <auto-card>Emry, <auto-card>Lurker</auto-card> of the Loch</auto-card>; or <auto-card>Urza's Saga</auto-card> in their deck.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Rhinos____cbb1af83-a156-42ef-957e-7bed0b243cca===

<p>Rhinos, with a 6.4% share of the winner's metagame, has a straightforward game plan: cast <auto-card>Shardless Agent</auto-card> or <auto-card>Violent Outburst</auto-card> on turn three to cascade into <auto-card>Crashing Footfalls</auto-card>, unleashing a horde of 4/4 Rhinos to quickly overpower your opponent. Despite the cascade restriction, the deck contains a surprising amount of cheap interaction, such as <auto-card>Fire // Ice</auto-card>, <auto-card>Force of Negation</auto-card>, <auto-card>Dead // Gone</auto-card>, and <auto-card>Fury</auto-card>. Recently, most successful versions of the deck have been straight-up Temur versions with access to <auto-card>Become Immense</auto-card> and <auto-card>Blood Moon</auto-card>, such as the list used by Stefan Steiner to win the Grand Open Qualifier at LMS Trieste. However, versions that splash for <auto-card>Leyline Binding</auto-card> and <auto-card>Ardent Plea</auto-card> are not far behind.</p>

<p>In terms of matchups, Rhinos fares well against Rakdos Undying and Yawgmoth, but struggles against Hammer Time and Living End. Cards that prevent you from casting or resolving <auto-card>Crashing Footfalls</auto-card> (such as <auto-card>Teferi, Time Raveler</auto-card>; <auto-card>Chalice of the Void</auto-card>; <auto-card>Drannith Magistrate</auto-card>; or <auto-card>Lavinia, Azorius Renegade</auto-card>) can also pose a challenge. <auto-card>Flusterstorm</auto-card> and <auto-card>Engineered Explosives</auto-card> are additional answers that you will often face after sideboard.</p>

<p>Despite these challenges, Rhinos remains a powerful deck, with a consistent and proactive game plan in every matchup. This makes it an excellent deck choice for newcomers to the format. If you're considering picking up the deck, don't be deterred by the possibility of an opposing Ragavan revealing <auto-card>Crashing Footfalls</auto-card>. It cannot be cast due to its lack of a mana cost, and it cannot be suspended because it's not in their hand. Another nifty interaction to keep in mind for versions with the white splash can come up when your opponent casts <auto-card>Leyline Binding</auto-card> and targets your Rhino token. If you respond with your own Binding and exile theirs, then your token will never get exiled and will stay on the battlefield.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Yawgmoth____89bc68f8-4a46-40ea-bce6-16ed75524dc8===

<p>Yawgmoth, with a 4.0% share of the record-weighted metagame, combines undying creatures and <auto-card>Yawgmoth, Thran Physician</auto-card> to generate card advantage and achieve infinite combos. With four copies of <auto-card>Chord of Calling</auto-card> and three <auto-card>Eldritch Evolution</auto-card>, players can consistently put their namesake card onto the battlefield. The deck has a good matchup against Hammer Time, whose tiny creatures are easy prey for <auto-card>Yawgmoth, Thran Physician</auto-card>'s activated ability. However, it struggles against <auto-card>Fury</auto-card>, which is commonly seen in Rakdos Undying and Rhinos.</p>

<p>When playing against Yawgmoth, it's important to be aware of its potential for infinite loops. One such loop can be achieved with <auto-card>Yawgmoth, Thran Physician</auto-card> and two undying creatures, one with a +1/+1 counter and another without. When Yawgmoth sacrifices the counterless creature, it returns with a +1/+1 counter. The other receives a -1/-1 counter, which cancels out against its +1/+1 counter. This can be repeated, and if the loop involves <auto-card>Geralf's Messenger</auto-card> or <auto-card>Blood Artist</auto-card>, then it can win the game on the spot. Keep an eye out for these game-winning loops and try to disrupt them as soon as possible.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Amulet_Titan____2665325a-b1fe-4de0-b847-d4913bd67ff3===

<p>Amulet Titan, with a 4.0% share of the winner's metagame, is an intricate ramp deck that exploits the synergy between <auto-card>Amulet of Vigor</auto-card> and bounce lands like <auto-card>Simic Growth Chamber</auto-card> to power out <auto-card>Primeval Titan</auto-card>. After you resolve Primal Titan, there are a variety of ways to seal the game.</p>

<p>With <auto-card>Amulet of Vigor</auto-card> in play, <auto-card>Primeval Titan</auto-card> can grab <auto-card>Slayers' Stronghold</auto-card> and <auto-card>Boros Garrison</auto-card> and attack right away. If <auto-card>Dryad of the Ilysian Grove</auto-card> is on the battlefield, you can fetch <auto-card>Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle</auto-card> and burn your opponent to a crisp. Even if the opponent has a spot removal spell, the deck can still have a way out by picking up <auto-card>Tolaria West</auto-card> with <auto-card>Simic Growth Chamber</auto-card>, transmuting it into <auto-card>Summoner's Pact</auto-card>, and grabbing another <auto-card>Primeval Titan</auto-card>. Mastering this deck requires a deep understanding of the various lines of play available, making it a challenging but ultimately rewarding endeavor.</p>

<p>Amulet Titan has a good matchup against decks low on interaction, such as Hammer Time and Burn, but it struggles against <auto-card>Blood Moon</auto-card> decks like Rakdos Undying. When playing against Amulet Titan, remember that <auto-card>Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle</auto-card> checks on both trigger and resolution. This means that if you can reduce the number of other Mountains to less than five in response, for example by destroying <auto-card>Dryad of the Ilysian Grove</auto-card>, no damage will be dealt.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Four-Color_Omnath____eab2812b-8f91-4a28-be8f-61015fb8b5fc===

<p>Four-Color Omnath, with a 3.7% share of the record-weighted metagame, uses the namesake card <auto-card>Omnath, Locus of Creation</auto-card> in conjunction with fetch lands to trigger it multiple times per turn. Since the ban of <auto-card>Yorion, Sky Nomad</auto-card>, Four-Color Omnath players have been trying various approaches. Most recently, the prominent build uses <auto-card>Risen Reef</auto-card> and <auto-card>Ephemerate</auto-card> and starts the game with <auto-card>Kaheera, the Orphanguard</auto-card> in the companion zone. All of these cards synergize well with <auto-card>Solitude</auto-card> and <auto-card>Fury</auto-card>. However, you may also encounter tribal versions with even more <auto-card>Elemental</auto-card>s, control versions with <auto-card>Counterspell</auto-card>, <auto-card>Expressive Iteration</auto-card>, and/or <auto-card>Lightning Bolt</auto-card>, or alternative builds with <auto-card>Keruga, the Macrosage</auto-card>. The archetype is highly customizable.</p>

<p>When playing against this deck, remember that mana from <auto-card>Cavern of Souls</auto-card> makes <auto-card>Elemental</auto-card>s uncounterable. It's still legal to target their <auto-card>Elemental</auto-card>s with <auto-card>Counterspell</auto-card>, but it won't do you much good. If they control <auto-card>Cavern of Souls</auto-card>, hold your countermagic for their noncreature spells instead.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Living_End____7d440873-6e51-4860-a3fe-cf65faa535fe===

<p>Living End, with a 3.2% share of the record-weighted metagame, is a combo deck that aims to cycle several creatures and then cascade into <auto-card>Living End</auto-card>, wiping all creatures from the battlefield while returning all the cyclers. The deck has <auto-card>Violent Outburst</auto-card> and <auto-card>Shardless Agent</auto-card> as guaranteed cascade cards, effectively giving the deck eight one-card combo pieces, along with numerous other cyclers to ensure consistency in drawing them.</p>

<p>Living End excels against creature-based decks with little interaction, such as Hammer Time and Rhinos. However, it has a lot of respect in the metagame as many decks have the tools to interact with it. Despite its ability to fight back with <auto-card>Grief</auto-card> and <auto-card>Force of Negation</auto-card>, Living End is vulnerable to <auto-card>Teferi, Time Raveler</auto-card>, <auto-card>Chalice of the Void</auto-card>, and <auto-card>Flusterstorm</auto-card>. Additionally, it is susceptible to graveyard hate cards such as <auto-card>Unlicensed Hearse</auto-card>, <auto-card>Dauthi Voidwalker</auto-card>, <auto-card>Leyline of the Void</auto-card>, and <auto-card>Endurance</auto-card>, making decks like Rakdos Undying particularly challenging to beat.</p>

<p>When playing against Living End, remember that sometimes your creatures are better dead than alive. Destroying or sacrificing your own creatures in response to <auto-card>Living End</auto-card> is often a good course of action.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Azorius_Control____97cfb606-f4e4-436b-afdb-0d60c82d5e5f===

<p>Azorius Control, with a 3.1% share of the record-weighted metagame, includes all the hallmarks of a traditional control deck: spot removal, countermagic, card draw, sweepers, and planeswalkers. Recently, the most prominent versions have incorporated <auto-card>Leyline Binding</auto-card>, which with the help of <auto-card>Zagoth Triome</auto-card> and <auto-card>Raugrin Triome</auto-card> becomes a one-mana removal spell. These Triomes also give a boost to <auto-card>Prismatic Ending</auto-card>, making them an integral part of the deck's strategy. You may also come across Four-Color Control decks that incorporate <auto-card>Wrenn and Six</auto-card>, which play out similarly to Azorius Control.</p>

<p>When playing against Azorius Control, always be mindful of sweepers and countermagic. Avoid overextending your threats into <auto-card>Supreme Verdict</auto-card>, and keep in mind that <auto-card>Archmage's Charm</auto-card> can both counter and steal your cards.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Burn____a02f1dd0-aca8-4dca-8cc2-50f3aea27d71===

<p>Burn, with a 2.9% share of the winner's metagame, embodies the philosophy of fire. The goal is to unleash a flurry of damage as quickly as possible, with an ideal opening hand featuring a turn one <auto-card>Goblin Guide</auto-card>, turn two double <auto-card>Lava Spike</auto-card>, and turn three triple <auto-card>Lightning Bolt</auto-card> for a staggering 21 damage. The deck has been a staple of the Modern format since its inception, preying on decks with painful fetch-shock mana bases.</p>

<p>However, four-color or five-color decks have been on the decline folloing the ban of <auto-card>Yorion, Sky Nomad</auto-card>, and Burn struggles against Hammer Time and Amulet Titan. While Burn remains an easy deck to pick up and play, other decks such as Rhinos and Domain Zoo are similarly forgiving, and they offer better positioning in the current metagame. For this reason, I would recommend Rhinos or Domain Zoo over Burn for new or returning Modern players.</p>

<p>When playing against Burn, be mindful of your life total. Think twice before pay 2 life for shock lands, consider exiling one of your own creatures with <auto-card>Solitude</auto-card> to bolster your life total, and grab <auto-card>Shadowspear</auto-card> with <auto-card>Urza's Saga</auto-card>. Another thing to keep in mind is the timing of your fetch lands against <auto-card>Goblin Guide</auto-card>. If you want to maximize the probability to draw a spell in your next draw step, then fetch in response to the trigger. If you need lands, then wait until end of turn instead. To see why, ignore the marginal impact of deck thinning and imagine the four ways in which the top two cards of your opponent's library can be ordered: land-land, land-spell, spell-land, and spell-spell. Comparing the difference for each option reveals the best fetch land timing against <auto-card>Goblin Guide</auto-card>.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Domain_Zoo____85d1b463-73ab-4be0-bbe1-eb21dbdb1d36===

<p>Domain Zoo, with a 2.6% share of the winner's metagame, is an aggressive deck that uses Triomes to power up <auto-card>Territorial Kavu</auto-card>, <auto-card>Scion of Draco</auto-card>, and <auto-card>Nishoba Brawler</auto-card>. These creatures can attack for four or five early on, turn <auto-card>Stubborn Denial</auto-card> into a hard counter, and will quickly put your opponent within <auto-card>Tribal Flames</auto-card> range. While Domain Zoo can be vulnerable to <auto-card>Blood Moon</auto-card> decks like Rakdos Undying, it has strong matchups against many other top-tier decks. I believe it's well-positioned in the current metagame, making it an excellent deck choice for the Modern format.</p>

<p>When playing against Domain Zoo, it can be useful to know that <auto-card>Dress Down</auto-card> and <auto-card>Merfolk Trickster</auto-card> can effectively kill <auto-card>Territorial Kavu</auto-card> by removing the ability that defines its power and toughness, turning it into a 0/0.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Mono-Green_Tron____5554a48e-dc5e-498e-9819-2ba524f2ee78===

<p>Mono-Green Tron, with a 1.9% share of the record-weighted metagame, is a ramp deck centered around the "Urzatron"–Urza's Mine, <auto-card>Urza's Power Plant</auto-card>, and <auto-card>Urza's Tower</auto-card>. This powerful trio of lands, first dubbed the "Urzatron" in the 90s as a reference to the Voltron TV series in which robots combine to become stronger, allows for the early casting of powerful cards like <auto-card>Karn Liberated</auto-card> as early as turn three.</p>

<p>On the following turn, Mono-Green Tron can further bolster its strategy with <auto-card>Cityscape Leveler</auto-card>, whose ability to dodge <auto-card>Counterspell</auto-card>s has made it a popular choice over <auto-card>Ugin, the Spirit Dragon</auto-card>. Other <i>Brothers' War</i> additions to the deck include <auto-card>Haywire Mite</auto-card> and <auto-card>The Stone Brain</auto-card> in the sideboard, which have strengthened the role of <auto-card>Karn, the Great Creator</auto-card>. Despite these improvements, Tron remains a fringe deck and its tabletop tournament results have been lackluster. It's like a super robot that can't seem to gain traction.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Merfolk____fd3094fa-13c9-4b1a-85ce-6f8204db1374===

<p>Merfolk, with an 1.8% share of the winner's metagame, is an archetype that has been around since the inception of the game. The original <auto-card>Lord of Atlantis</auto-card> dates all the way back to Alpha, and newer versions like <i>Dominaria United</i>'s <auto-card>Vodalian Hexcatcher</auto-card> provide more interaction while keeping the overall theme of the deck intact.</p>

<p>When playing against Merfolk, be aware of the unexpected interactions that <auto-card>Aether Vial</auto-card> can provide. For example, <auto-card>Merfolk Trickster</auto-card> can remove the abilities granted by cards like <auto-card>Undying Malice</auto-card> or <auto-card>Feign Death</auto-card>. <auto-card>Vodalian Hexcatcher</auto-card> may also counter your <auto-card>Indomitable Creativity</auto-card>, and <auto-card>Harbinger of the Tides</auto-card> can bounce your attacker after sideboarding. It's like a school of fish darting and weaving through your defenses, always ready to strike.</p>

<h1>Looking Ahead</h1>

<p>This concludes my coverage of the top 15 deck archetypes in Modern, but there are many other strategies that are also competitive viable, and the metagame continues to evolve. Perhaps even this weekend, as Modern will be featured at the 8-player <a href="https://magic.gg/news/2022-magic-online-champions-showcase-season-3-viewers-guide" target="_blank">Magic Online Champions Showcase</a>. In this event, top competitors from the last <i>Magic Online</i> season will battle for their share of a $70,000 prize pool and two World Championship invitations.

<p>The countdown has begun, for me and the hundreds of competitors who will travel to Philadelphia Feb. 17-19 for the return of the Pro Tour alongside <a href="https://mcphiladelphia.mtgfestivals.com/en-us.html" target="_blank">MagicCon: Philadelphia</a>. And as The Gathering (tm) returns, I've been thinking about all that's about to return along with it.</p>

<p>It's been a long time—I've adopted a cat and added a kid since the last time we had a Pro Tour—so I think a big question on the minds of many of us in the coverage world at least is this: <i>Is what comes next going to look like what came before?</i></p>

<h1>All Eyes on Philadelphia</h1>

<p>The last few years have been a drastic departure from (almost) everything that came before, both for <i>Magic</i> and the rest of our lives. And while high-level <i>Magic</i> found a way, there were certainly some things lost in translation. One of the most obvious might be the Pro Tour testing house, which historically was a one or two-week period before a Pro Tour (which came on the heels of a new set release—just like with <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/products/phyrexia-all-will-be-one" target="_blank"><i>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</i></a>—where teams would rent out a space and grind drafts and Constructed to prepare. The "Pro Tour house" has consistently been among the most memorable experiences for burgeoning Pro Tour players, and this is one staple I expect to see in full over the next few weeks. And who knows—maybe some team out there will figure out how to take things to the next level.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">With the Pro Tour coming back, If I can’t qualify my offer of being a chef for a testing house is very much real and on the table 👀</p>&mdash; Anderson LeClair (@andersoneclair) <a href="https://twitter.com/andersoneclair/status/1511693646520795141?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 6, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Thirty-five days until the Pro Tour. That means less than a month before players from across the world begin gathering and the Pro Tour "experience" begins for many. All of which is a long way to say this: the Pro Tour isn't just <i>coming,</i> for hundreds of players living out their Pro Tour dream, it's damn near <i>here.</i> And for those of you who are <a href="https://twitter.com/wizards_magic/status/1603465256390561806" target="_blank">going to be at the event</a>, there will be <a href="https://magic.gg/news/magiccon-philadelphia-and-the-2023-magiccon-schedule#Details" target="_blank">qualifying events</a> to get you started on your own path to the Pro Tour.</p>

<p>It's the second week of January, and the page is officially turning to the 2023 season. Over the past three months we've covered a dozen Regional Championships and the twists and turns of Pioneer along the way. We've covered the best of the best from online events (<a href="https://magic.gg/news/the-week-that-was-with-a-cherryxman-on-top" target="_blank">Kiran Dhokia</a> and <a href="https://magic.gg/news/the-week-that-was-rolph-champion" target="_blank">Sam Rolph</a> come to mind), we've covered old-school Pro Tour players returning to the fold, and we've covered the <a href="https://magic.gg/news/the-week-that-was-the-greatest-steuer-ever-told" target="_blank">incredible rise of the newest World Champion</a> with Nathan Steuer.</p>

<p>All of these are more than just individual stories of individual tournaments. We're not just telling the stories of tournaments that have come before, we're telling stories of the tournaments to come—because these players whose stories and decks Frank and I feature are the foundation of the Pro Tour's return in 2023. For the hundreds of first-time Pro Tour players who will make their debut in a few short weeks, their first chapter has been written and they've been generous enough to let us in on the ride. And we'll be right there with them for the next.</p>

<h1>Regional Championships Wrap Up in China</h1>

<p>I'm feeling a bit retrospective because today I'm covering the final Regional Championship result that will feed into the first events of 2023. Due to delays from COVID, the MTG China Open was pushed back several weeks, but they wrapped up recently and crowned champions from the 83 players in the four events that made up the tournament.</p>

<p>With the delay, competitors had the opportunity to take in all the results from previous events. As anyone who is a regular reader of <a href="https://magic.gg/news/metagame-mentor-everything-to-know-about-standard-to-win-your-rcq" target="_blank">the Metagame Mentor column</a> (and if you're not, you should be) known, Pioneer has proven reliably unreliable at the top over the course of the Regional Championship season. While the decks are largely known commodities, we've seen surprise Top 8 appearances and an even more diverse spread of winning decks. All that information is now at the fingertips of those gathering in Philadelphia, so a Pro Tour complete with <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/products/the-brothers-war" target="_blank"><i>The Brothers' War</i></a> and <i>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</i> cards now build from that foundation.</p>

<p>The Regional Championship in China was the last chance to get a high-level look at the format, and it delivered on that. As <a href="https://magic.gg/news/regional-champions-crowned-at-mtg-china-open" target="_blank">coverage vet Meghan Wolff wrote</a> in the roundup of the event, It was a weekend of upheaval for Pioneer. Favorite Rakdos Midrange only qualified a single player—Man Lok Wong who placed second in Hong Kong—while surprises like Lotus Field Combo, Izzet Control, and Mono-Red Fires also qualified players for the Pro Tour.</p>

<p>The MTG China Open also featured the return of a Pioneer classic and a full circle of sorts, with Mono-Green Devotion winning tournaments in Hong Kong and Shanghai in the hands of Pok Man Chan and 敏逸蔡.</p>

<p>If that was the biggest surprise from the weekend, it would still be a wrench for deckbuilders to consider for Philadelphia—clearly there's a price to be paid for pushing your deck too far into the midrange matchups and losing the ability to keep up with Green. But the other two events in China pushed things even further, with an old favorite showing it's still potent and a new contender that has popped up over the past few weeks and will have a lot of momentum heading into the Pro Tour. Jiao Hongchen won the event in Beijing, while 健涛 莫 was victorious in Shenzhen.</p>

<p>The decks worth watching are Lotus Field combo and Gruul Vehicles. It's a sign of the diversity in the format that two <i>extremely</i> different decks were able to find success in what had looked like a well-defined field. It proves that there's still a lot of life left in exploring the format before Philadelphia.</p>

<p>I'll leave it up to Frank to cover what the format looks like as we near the Pro Tour, but as an observer who hasn't dug deep into the format yet (I'm still a Modern main), the constant churning of decks winning events over the Regional Championship season has been fun to watch and it certainly sets the stage for a very interesting scene in Philly.</p>

<p>And with that, we've officially tied a bow on the first Regional Championship season. It's been a bit of whirlwind to cover if I'm being honest, and in the best way possible! A dozen high-level <i>Magic</i> tournaments over the course of three months, and now a short lull before the Pro Tour fires it all back up again? Sign me up for this cadence for the rest of the year—that's a <i>lot</i> of <i>Magic</i> to peruse for anyone looking to get an edge at FNM or begin their own journey to the Pro Tour.</p>

While it's exciting to see the return of the Pro Tour at <a href="https://mcphiladelphia.mtgfestivals.com/content/sitebuilder/rna/mtg-festivals/global/en-us/magiccon-news/magiccon-philadelphia-the-lineup.html" target="_blank">MagicCon: Philadelphia</a> in five weeks, most competitive Magic journeys start at local stores with Regional Championship Qualifiers.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/DJPNxAlrmrCNwY5ZB7Fc6/a1e2363f540575f16e5741b149b2280d/1080x1080-Magic-Premier-Play-Path-2022-2023-Infographic.jpg" /></div></div><br />

<p>The possible formats for RCQs are Limited, Modern, Pioneer, and Standard. If you are eager to participate in a Standard RCQ but are unsure what to expect in that format, this article can act as your one-stop shop to help you get started!</p>

<p>To find RCQs nearby, check the <a href="https://locator.wizards.com/search?searchType=magic-events&amp;tag=regional_championship_qualifier&amp;query=Los%20Angeles,%20CA,%20USA&amp;distance=100&amp;page=1&amp;sort=date&amp;sortDirection=asc" target="_blank">Store &amp; Event Locator</a> or your <a href="https://magic.gg/pro-tour?section=regional-championships#pro-tour" target="_blank">regional organizer's website</a>. Through April 3, players can earn a qualification for the third cycle of Regional Championships, which will be held in May, June, or July (depending on your region) and will feed the Pro Tour at MagicCon: Europe in July.</p>

<h1>The Standard Metagame</h1>

<p><a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/formats/standard" target="_blank">Standard</a> is a 60-card format that rotates every fall. Currently, it allows expansion sets from <i>Innistrad: Midnight Hunt</i> forward. It's the most popular way to play Constructed on <i>MTG Arena</i>, and it's the format for the second cycle of Regional Championships, which will be held in March and April (depending on your region).</p>

<p>To grasp the latest Standard developments, I analyzed 376 decklists from large competitive events over the past few weeks. Specifically, I used all available <a href="https://www.mtgo.com/en/mtgo/decklists" target="_blank"><i>Magic Online</i> decklists</a> from Standard Challenge and Super Qualifier events held from December 13, 2022 through January 9, 2023. In addition, I used Top 8 decklists from three Standard events in Tokyo—the <a href="https://www.hareruyamtg.com/en/deck/result?eventName=Champions+Cup+Premier+Qualifier+in+Hareruya+TC+Tokyo+-+2022/12/18" target="_blank">Premier RCQ</a>, <a href="https://www.hareruyamtg.com/en/deck/result?eventName=Champions+Cup+Cycle+2+Area+Qualifier+in+Hareruya+TC+Tokyo" target="_blank">Area RCQ</a>, and <a href="https://www.hareruyamtg.com/en/deck/result?eventName=THE+LAST+SUN+2022+-+Top8+Standard" target="_blank">The Last Sun</a>—as well as all MTG Melee decklists with net positive wins from the <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Tournament/View/13043" target="_blank">Cool Spot Year Finale</a> and <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Tournament/View/12957" target="_blank">The Pizza Box: Standard Slice</a>. I chose these events because they either provide an indirect path toward the Pro Tour or because they act as a barometer for the format.</p>

<p>To provide a metagame snapshot that combines popularity and performance, I assigned an archetype label to each deck and awarded a number of points equal to the deck's net wins, i.e., its number of match wins minus losses. For example, a deck that went 5–1 in the Swiss followed by a loss in the quarterfinals was assigned three points. The sum of these numbers for every archetype yields its record-weighted metagame share, which represents its share of total net wins. It may be interpreted as a winner's metagame that you can expect to see at the top tables.</p>

<p>The most-played non-basic cards across all main decks and sideboards were <auto-card>Reckoner Bankbuster</auto-card>, <auto-card>Fable of the Mirror-Breaker</auto-card>, <auto-card>Abrade</auto-card>, <auto-card>Cut Down</auto-card>, <auto-card>Go for the Throat</auto-card>, <auto-card>Make Disappear</auto-card>, <auto-card>Bloodtithe Harvester</auto-card>, and <auto-card>Wedding Announcement</auto-card>. These are the defining staples of the format that you will face in a large variety of matchups. As these cards suggest, most competitive Standard decks are good-stuff midrange strategies.</p>

<p>The breakout metagame development over the past month is the emergence of Izzet Powerstones. This archetype, which I'll cover in more detail later, is capable of going over the top of Grixis Midrange, even though it struggles with aggro decks. This has led to a downtick in Grixis Midrange and an uptick in Azorius Soldiers. Izzet Powerstones has become the premier artifact-based deck in Standard, which has led to the disappearance of Grixis Sacrifice.</p>

<h1>The Top 10 Standard Deck Archetypes</h1>

<p>To take a closer look at the 10 archetypes with the highest record-weighted metagame share, I've used a decklist aggregation algorithm that takes into account the popularity and performance of individual card choices.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Grixis_Midrange____d0ae4d1c-d9a1-47ce-ac98-643fcd749d0a===

<p>At 24.2% of the winner's metagame, Grixis Midrange continues its domination of Standard. The deck won last year's <a href="https://magic.gg/events/magic-world-championship-xxviii" target="_blank">World Championship</a> in the hands of Nathan Steuer, and its popularity has skyrocketed since then. Grixis has the best threats, interaction, and card advantage across blue, black, and red, and there are various ways to build it. But all versions aim to have higher individual card quality than opposing decks. You can control the early game with <auto-card>Make Disappear</auto-card> and <auto-card>Bloodtithe Harvester</auto-card>, pull ahead on card advantage with <auto-card>Fable of the Mirror-Breaker</auto-card> and <auto-card>Corpse Appraiser</auto-card>, and lock up the late game with <auto-card>Invoke Despair</auto-card>.</p>

<p>When playing with or against this deck, it's important to recognize the interplay between <auto-card>Make Disappear</auto-card> and <auto-card>Fable of the Mirror-Breaker</auto-card>. <auto-card>Fable of the Mirror-Breaker</auto-card> is one of the most powerful cards in Standard, and <auto-card>Make Disappear</auto-card> is one of the cleanest ways to answer it. When you can counter their turn-three Fable, then untap and resolve yours, then that's a great way to break serve. So when you're on the draw on turn two, consider passing with <auto-card>Make Disappear</auto-card> mana rather than casting <auto-card>Bloodtithe Harvester</auto-card> or <auto-card>Reckoner Bankbuster</auto-card>. And when you're on the play without a potent three-drop, don't waste <auto-card>Make Disappear</auto-card> on their two-drop. If you can destroy their turn-two play with <auto-card>Abrade</auto-card> and hold <auto-card>Make Disappear</auto-card> for a potential turn-three Fable, then that's usually better.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Azorius_Soldiers____d948b49b-69a6-4f4f-8f5d-6680e497c84c===

<p>Azorius Soldiers, at 13.0% of the winner's metagame, has become the second-most popular archetype in <i>The Brothers' War</i> Standard. The deck has a great mana curve that can put a lot of pressure on your opponent right from the start. You could start with <auto-card>Recruitment Officer</auto-card> or <auto-card>Yotian Frontliner</auto-card> on turn one; <auto-card>Harbin, Vanguard Aviator</auto-card> or <auto-card>Valiant Veteran</auto-card> on turn two; and <auto-card>Skystrike Officer</auto-card> or <auto-card>Siege Veteran</auto-card> on turn three. <auto-card>Fortified Beachhead</auto-card> solidifies your mana consistency and provides inherent flood protection.</p>

<p>When playing against this deck, remember that they have various ways to give their Soldiers +1/+1 at instant speed. If they attack a 2/2 Soldier into your 2/3, then check if they can activate <auto-card>Fortified Beachhead</auto-card> or if there's <auto-card>Valiant Veteran</auto-card> in their graveyard. Another thing to keep in mind is that many recent Azorius Soldiers versions have slimmed down on three-drops like <auto-card>Brutal Cathar</auto-card> and <auto-card>In the Trenches</auto-card> and have added more instant-speed interaction like <auto-card>Slip Out the Back</auto-card> and <auto-card>Zephyr Sentinel</auto-card>. These can counter your spot removal spells, so watch out for that.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Esper_Midrange____9223888c-92fb-44c8-b8e4-e6f02eec6d9c===

<p>Esper Midrange, at 11.1% of the record-weighted metagame, has the best threats and interaction across blue, black, and white. The curve of turn two <auto-card>Dennick, Pious Apprentice</auto-card>; turn three <auto-card>Raffine, Scheming Seer</auto-card>; turn four <auto-card>Sheoldred, the Apocalypse</auto-card> can be deadly—you'll be attacking with an enormous lifelinker while getting multiple Sheoldred triggers! Even though the matchup against Grixis Midrange tends to be slightly unfavorable, the individual card quality in the Esper shard remains amazing and is capable of overpowering many Standard decks.</p>

<p>When playing against Esper Midrange, don't forget about the static ability on <auto-card>Dennick, Pious Apprentice</auto-card>. It will stop the triggered abilities on <auto-card>Corpse Appraiser</auto-card>, <auto-card>Graveyard Trespasser</auto-card>, <auto-card>Extraction Specialist</auto-card>, <auto-card>Bloodthirsty Adversary</auto-card>, and so on. To extract maximum value from these creatures, destroy Dennick beforehand. Dennick also shuts down the reflexive trigger from the second chapter of <auto-card>The Restoration of Eiganjo</auto-card>, so don't discard when your opponent controls Dennick.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Mono-White_Midrange____4ebb4b01-5942-40d1-815a-5245ff5ce005===

<p>Mono-White Midrange, at 10.0% of the winner's metagame, is arguably the most consistent midrange deck in Standard, as it sticks to a single color and has two-mana creatures that help find land drops. The deck has access to <auto-card>Wedding Announcement</auto-card> and <auto-card>The Wandering Emperor</auto-card>—two of the most powerful cards in Standard—and the mono-color mana base allows you to exploit <auto-card>Lay Down Arms</auto-card> from <i>The Brothers' War</i>. The versions that have been most successful in recent weeks have replaced <auto-card>Anointed Peacekeeper</auto-card> by <auto-card>Loran of the Third Path</auto-card>, which effectively trades for <auto-card>Fable of the Mirror-Breaker</auto-card> or <auto-card>Wedding Announcement</auto-card>, and they have favored <auto-card>Roadside Reliquary</auto-card> over <auto-card>Mishra's Foundry</auto-card>.</p>

<p>When playing against this deck, consider boarding out most of your spot removal spells. <auto-card>Cut Down</auto-card> has no juicy targets, as destroying <auto-card>Ambitious Farmhand</auto-card>, <auto-card>Spirited Companion</auto-card>, or <auto-card>Loran of the Third Path</auto-card> results in card disadvantage. <auto-card>Go for the Throat</auto-card> has very few good targets as well, as it cannot target <auto-card>Steel Seraph</auto-card> or <auto-card>Reckoner Bankbuster</auto-card>, and it merely removes a single shield counter from <auto-card>Sanctuary Warden</auto-card>. <auto-card>Soul Transfer</auto-card> is a great answer, though.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Mono-Red_Aggro____ad1d349c-a0b4-450d-ad93-a6ebfb97984b===

<p>Mono-Red Aggro, at 8.6% of the record-weighted metagame, is a fast, aggressive deck that aims to take the opponent down to zero life as quickly as possible. While Mono-Red Aggro is mostly about haste creatures and burn spells, the prowess mechanic is important as well. To reliably trigger <auto-card>Monastery Swiftspear</auto-card> and <auto-card>Jaya, Fiery Negotiator</auto-card>'s tokens, the deck uses a playset of <auto-card>Reckless Impulse</auto-card>. <auto-card>Feldon, Ronom Excavator</auto-card> and <auto-card>Atsushi, the Blazing Sky</auto-card> keep the cards flowing as well. By focusing on card advantage rather than single-mindedly aggressive creatures like <auto-card>Phoenix Chick</auto-card>, these latest incarnations of Mono-Red Aggro have decent staying power in a long game.</p>

<p>When playing against this deck, it's important to recognize that Mono-Red has a lot of burn spells that can target players. If you've stabilized at a dangerously low life total, consider exiling one of your own creatures with <auto-card>The Wandering Emperor</auto-card> or <auto-card>Lay Down Arms</auto-card> to ensure you won't lose to a topdecked <auto-card>Lightning Strike</auto-card>.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Izzet_Powerstones____94201286-3ef1-44b8-9617-d1eb753781b5===

<p>Izzet Powerstones is the new hotness in Standard, made possible by <i>The Brothers' War</i>. The game plan is to use Powerstones to ramp into <auto-card>Cityscape Leveler</auto-card> and <auto-card>Skitterbeam Battalion</auto-card> ahead of the curve. These eight-mana and nine-mana creatures can easily go over the top of midrange opponents. It's really hard for them to beat the curve of turn three <auto-card>Stern Lesson</auto-card>, turn four <auto-card>The <auto-card>Mightstone</auto-card> and Weakstone</auto-card>, and turn five <auto-card>Cityscape Leveler</auto-card>. Even if <auto-card>Cityscape Leveler</auto-card> gets countered, you still get to destroy a permanent and unearth it later, which means that <auto-card>Make Disappear</auto-card> is not a clean answer either. Overall, Izzet Powerstones seems well-positioned when midrange decks are dominating the tournaments.</p>

<p>When playing against this deck, you'll usually be at a disadvantage if the game goes long, so you'll want to quickly end the game before they can cast their heavy-hitters. However, keep in mind that they can sweep the board with <auto-card>Brotherhood's End</auto-card>. While you shouldn't let your foot off the gas completely, you should manage your sequencing and sizing with the 3-damage sweeper in mind. For example, use <auto-card>Siege Veteran</auto-card> to get a key threat to 4 toughness, and think twice before adding another tiny creature to the battlefield on the turn where your <auto-card>Fable of the Mirror-Breaker</auto-card> transforms.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Rakdos_Midrange____6bf11bdd-0a35-4426-b2a2-a41be9946a5c===

<p>Rakdos Midrange is basically Grixis Midrange without the blue splash. This results in a superior mana base, and the in-color replacements like <auto-card>Graveyard Trespasser</auto-card> and <auto-card>Duress</auto-card> are not that much worse than <auto-card>Corpse Appraiser</auto-card> and <auto-card>Make Disappear</auto-card>. However, the vast majority of Standard players believe that swapping out several basic Swamp and Mountain for <auto-card>Shipwreck Marsh</auto-card> and <auto-card>Shivan Reef</auto-card> is a small cost that is worth paying to gain access to the powerful blue options. Accordingly, Rakdos Midrange remains a fringe option.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Mono-Blue_Tempo____c1cca3a7-5343-4f9e-9e87-463175beffce===

<p>Mono-Blue Tempo contains an enormous amount of instant and sorcery spells to boost <auto-card>Haughty Djinn</auto-card> and reduce <auto-card>Tolarian Terror</auto-card>'s cost. Spells like <auto-card>Fading Hope</auto-card> and <auto-card>Slip Out the Back</auto-card> provide mana-efficient ways to net a temporary battlefield advantage, which is what a tempo strategy is all about. The deck clings to a large number of basic Islands to refill with <auto-card>Thirst for Discovery</auto-card> and <auto-card>Flow of Knowledge</auto-card>.</p>

<p>When playing against this deck, keep jamming your creatures into open mana because they don't have that many ways to counter them, and even if they do, it means they can't spend their mana on <auto-card>Impulse</auto-card> or <auto-card>Thirst for Discovery</auto-card>. When it comes to interactive spells, however, remember that they have <auto-card>Spell Pierce</auto-card>, <auto-card>Negate</auto-card>, and <auto-card>Slip Out the Back</auto-card> to protect their creatures, which means that tapping out for a removal spell might play right into their cards. While every situation is different, you may be better off by spending your mana on creatures and entering a damage race instead.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Mardu_Midrange____3d4ffb39-12c0-44c9-8364-b5dffa93e1b0===

<p>Mardu Midrange has access to both <auto-card>Wedding Announcement</auto-card> and <auto-card>Fable of the Mirror-Breaker</auto-card>, which is appealing even if Mardu doesn't have a tri-land. The color combination also unlocks the full power of <auto-card>Archangel of Wrath</auto-card>. Due to the high density of powerful cards available in the Mardu colors, there's a high degree of customizability to the archetype, and every version can look different.</p>

<p>When playing against this deck, be aware of the capabilities of <auto-card>Fable of the Mirror-Breaker</auto-card>. Once it transforms into <auto-card>Reflection of Kiki-Jiki</auto-card>, it can copy <auto-card>Bloodtithe Harvester</auto-card> to effectively create a removal effect, but they can't pay the kicker cost on a copied <auto-card>Archangel of Wrath</auto-card> and they can't copy <auto-card>Loran of the Third Path</auto-card> because it's legendary. Another interaction to keep in mind is when they've cast Fable via <auto-card>Serra Paragon</auto-card>: When they exile it to the third chapter, it returns as a new permanent with no memory, which means that it loses the exile clause and it can be replayed after it dies.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Boros_Midrange____498b15f9-bbc3-4800-9a95-260dde2c7a95===

<p>Boros Midrange is basically Mono-White Midrange splashing for <auto-card>Fable of the Mirror-Breaker</auto-card>. This provides access to one of the most powerful cards in the format, but it comes at the cost of a weaker mana base. While the number of sources of each color is perfectly fine, you're making substantial sacrifices to <auto-card>Lay Down Arms</auto-card>. <auto-card>Sundown Pass</auto-card> and Mountain don't power up the sorcery, while <auto-card>Jetmir's Garden</auto-card> and <auto-card>Sacred Peaks</auto-card> can get in the way of smooth curve-outs. Due to these issues, Boros Midrange remains a fringe option.</p>

<h1>Looking Ahead</h1>

<p>While I covered the top ten deck archetypes in Standard, many other strategies are competitive viable as well, and the metagame keeps on developing. Nevertheless, it's always good to be aware of the Decks to Beat at the moment, as this knowledge helps you enter a Standard RCQ with confidence. Pick your favorite deck or construct your own, then set out for battle!</p>

<p>In the coming weeks, other Constructed formats are on the docket as well. This weekend, January 14-15, competitive play is kicking off with a bang, as the weekend features several large tabletop events where players may earn Regional Championship invites, reunite with fellow competitors, or reach impressive new accomplishments:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The Modern Grand Open Qualifier at <a href="https://legacyeuropeantour.com/event/lms-trieste/" target="_blank">LMS Trieste</a>, with <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/legacyeuropeantour" target="_blank">live coverage on Twitch</a>, 32 Regional Championship invites at stake, and prizes exceeding $30K in value.</li>
	<li>The Modern $20K at <a href="https://scgcon.starcitygames.com/event/scg-con-new-jersey-2023/" target="_blank">SCG Con New Jersey</a>, with <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/anzidmtg" target="_blank">live coverage on Twitch</a> on Sunday and 4 Regional Championship invites at stake.</li>
	<li>The Pioneer/Modern <a href="https://articles.nerdragegaming.com/2022-nrg-series-championship-structure/" target="_blank">NRG Series Championship</a>, an invite-only tournament for the top 16 players from the 2022 NRG Series, with <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/NRGSeries" target="_blank">live coverage on Twitch</a> starting at 10:00 AM CT.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm looking forward to dive into Modern next week, especially when the 8-player <a href="https://www.mtgo.com/premier-play-2023" target="_blank"><i>Magic Online</i> Champions Showcase</a> on January 21 will also feature the format. I'm excited to see what competitive <i>Magic</i> will have in store for us in 2023!</p>]]></description></item><item><title>MagicCon: Philadelphia and the 2023 MagicCon Schedule</title><link>https://magic.gg/news/magiccon-philadelphia-and-the-2023-magiccon-schedule</link><guid>https://magic.gg/news/magiccon-philadelphia-and-the-2023-magiccon-schedule</guid><description><![CDATA[<p><em>(Editor's Note January 11, 2023: The date and location for MagicCon in Europe were added.)</em></p>

<p><i>Magic</i> 30 was just the beginning: February 17–19, 2023, <i>all will gather</i> at MagicCon: Philadelphia!</p>

<p>With the kickoff for <i>Magic</i>'s 30th anniversary celebrations in the books, we're turning our attention to MagicCon, our new festival event series that further celebrates <i>Magic</i> four more times in 2023. <i>Magic</i> 30 was an amazing experience with 10,000 attendees, and we're making our gathering in Philadelphia even better!</p>

<p>Below, you'll find the details for MagicCon: Philadelphia, many of the ways in which we're looking to improve the experience, a schedule for the other MagicCon events in 2023, and the return and expansion of the New Perspectives grant program!</p>

<p>Tickets go on sale December 1 at <a href="https://mtgfestivals.com/" target="_blank">mtgfestivals.com</a>. In the meantime, read further to learn more information on:</p>

<h1>MagicCon: Philadelphia Experience Updates</h1>

<p>The first stop on the MagicCon tour in 2023 is Philadelphia, the "City of Brotherly Love" and home to Reading Terminal Market (important for visitors—and me). Taking place February 17–19, MagicCon: Philadelphia will feature the first Pro Tour of the year, exclusive events like the new <i>Secret Lair</i> Showdown (more on this below), and the immersive experience fans loved at <i>Magic</i> 30.</p>

<p>We've also taken lessons and your feedback from <i>Magic</i> 30 to improve the attendee experience. While <i>Magic</i> 30 was an unforgettable experience, it was also our first event of this kind <i>and</i> our first live event since the pandemic shut down "the gathering" nearly three years ago. We learned quite a bit from the event and are making some improvements that we think will make Philadelphia even better.</p>

<p>If you prefer information in video form, Director of Play Programs Billy Jensen was recently on Weekly MTG to discuss what we learned from <i>Magic</i> 30, how we're making the experience in Philadelphia even better, and detailing more about our Premier Play programs.</p>

<embed-iframe fallback-img="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/1InItYKoxcVOIjCrA6aO4L/90673d36527a279cbfcb2c4450b31e2f/1920x1080-Weekly-MTG-Thumb-20221110.jpg" has-consent="true"   width="950" height="534" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/br5GczP7v30" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></embed-iframe>

<p>The first big change is just that: Philadelphia will be big, as in <i>double the space from Las Vegas</i>. At <i>Magic</i> 30, the entire event fit into 220,000 square feet. In Philadelphia, we're going to have more than 450,000 square feet, all at the Pennsylvania Convention Center! (This is why we moved the event to Philadelphia from originally announced Charlotte—we couldn't get this much space in Charlotte.) For attendees that's more play space, more event space, and more Command Zone.</p>

<p>For the Command Zone specifically, it was a hot topic over the <i>Magic</i> 30 weekend as we adapted the experience. Players played Commander wherever they could around the hall, and we heard the feedback loud and clear that attendees wanted the Command Zone experience for every badge type. So, for MagicCon: Philadelphia, Command Zone access will be purchasable as an add-on for any ticket for $30/day or $75 for the entire three-day weekend.</p>

<p>Featured artists were popular at <i>Magic</i> 30, and illustrator guests continue at MagicCon: Philadelphia. We're excited to announce that John Avon will be joining our featured artists lineup! <a href="#Art">We'll share more</a> featured artists for MagicCon: Philadelphia soon.</p>

<p>Finally, we also acknowledge that there were difficulties with both event registration and event start times that led to some poor experiences for fans. These difficulties were largely due to event software integration and not a reflection on how our partner Pastimes managed the tournament space. We are working internally and with ReedPop to find better solutions in these spaces ahead of MagicCon: Philadelphia.</p>

<div id="Schedule"></div>

<p>There will be so much to enjoy at this event. The Cosplay Contest is returning (with updated prizes), the <i>Weatherlight</i> and immersive Planeswalker lairs are making the trip, and there will be new panels, merchandise, and events. Whether you were in Las Vegas or missed our inaugural event, you can enjoy plenty of new and returning experiences at MagicCon: Philadelphia.</p>

<h1>The 2023 MagicCon Schedule</h1>

<p>After Philadelphia, the party doesn't stop! We'll have three more MagicCon events in 2023 at the locations below. Note that for 2024 we're exploring expanding MagicCon outside of North America and Europe!</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>February 17–19, 2023</b>: MagicCon: Philadelphia</li>
	<li><b>May 5–7, 2023</b>: MagicCon: Minneapolis</li>
	<li><b>July 28–30</b>: MagicCon: Barcelona</li>
	<li><b>September 22–24, 2023</b>: MagicCon: Las Vegas and <i>Magic</i> World Championship XXIX</li>
</ul>

<div id="Perspectives"></div>

<p>Each of these events will be shaped after the experience at <i>Magic</i> 30, will include a Pro Tour stop (or the World Championship) and, of course, we'll be making improvements along the way!</p>

<h1>The New Perspectives Grant Program</h1>

<p>The New Perspectives Grant Program is a program that aims to support the inclusion of <i>Magic</i> enthusiasts who belong to historically underrepresented groups by providing assistance to attend MagicCon events. After its first successful outing in Las Vegas, we're expanding the program for all of 2023 to all four MagicCon events!</p>

<p>How successful was it? Just ask the winner of the <i>Magic</i> 30 Cosplay Contest!</p>

<p><i>Secret Lair</i> Showdown Qualifiers at MagicCon: Philadelphia will be Pioneer, with events firing at 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. Friday and Saturday. They lead to the <i>Secret Lair</i> Showdown Championship on Sunday morning, also in the Pioneer format. We'll have more information on prizes and pricing on December 1.</p>

<p><b>Black Lotus VIP Event</b>: On Sunday, February 19 at 11 a.m. all Black Lotus VIP badge holders can play in this <i>free</i> event featuring <i>Dominaria Remastered</i> Sealed! This event will feature special prizes for participants, and it only takes place on Sunday at 11 a.m. for these badge holders.</p>

<p><b>Pro Tour 2 Qualifiers</b>: Eight Pro Tour 2 invitations are on the line over the course of the weekend, taking place across two events: one at 12 p.m. Friday, February 17, and one at 12 p.m. Saturday, February 18. Each event will be Sealed Deck with a Top 8 draft. The Top 4 competitors of each event earn invitations. (Pro Tour 2 will take place at MagicCon: Minneapolis May 5–7, 2023.)</p>

<p><b>The Un-Known!</b>: Join Gavin Verhey and friends as they take you on a journey through Un-Known <i>Magic</i>! This event, and the fun within, will never be the same twice as the products (which are unknown), the formats (also unknown), and the twists and turns (uh, obviously unknown) will be at the whim of your host(s)! Bring nothing with you, because the fun and cards will be provided as you experience the Un-Known! Please be advised that this event may be listed multiple times, but it is never the same game twice! Also, despite the name, <i>Un-</i> product will not necessarily be involved in this event. Also also, keep all limbs safely in the vehicle and expect to have no idea what to expect for 3–4 hours of Un-Known <i>Magic</i>-al adventure.</p>

<p>We'll have <i>some</i> more details on December 1, but the rest will be—you guessed it—unknown!</p>

<p><b>Dedicated On-Demand Events</b>: One of the most common requests we received was for more space for on-demand events—and we heard you! On-demand events will be run all weekend and will have a dedicated area in the Play Hall (Hall F). These events are still subject to space and admin availability, but there will certainly be more room available than at <i>Magic</i> 30.</p>

<p><b>The Command Zone</b>: The Command Zone space is popular—so popular we've added the add-on Command Zone benefit for $30 per day or $75 for the whole weekend, available for any ticket package.</p>

<p>And much, much more! Visit mtgfestivals.com and <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayMTG" target="_blank">@PlayMTG</a> on December 1 for a full rundown of all play opportunities!</p>

Due to COVID restrictions, China’s Regional Championship was split into four events in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Beijing, and Shenzhen. Each of the top two players at these events qualified for Pro Tour I in Philadelphia in February.

# EIGHT MORE FOR THE PRO TOUR

The MTG China Open was the last of twelve Regional Championships that happened all around the world over the past two months. Each event qualified anywhere from one to 48 players for Pro Tour I, and the two finalists from each of China’s mini-RCs, for a total of eight, will join them.

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/5T8BycvjsQMSFo4SyE9fAi/4772ea98803a6a7d6def02f071187e40/mco_012.jpg" /><p class="embedImageCaption">MTG China Open competitors in Shanghai</p></div></div><br />

One final and important question remains – which of these players will earn the invite to Magic World Championship XXIX? It’s one that’ll have to be answered another day, as they’ll need to meet for one final mega Top 8 to determine who gets the invite.

# GREEN SURGES AHEAD

While Mono-Green Devotion was the top pick for the first Regional Championships of the season back in early November, it quickly lost ground to Rakdos Midrange and, eventually, Mono-White Humans. 

While it once again wasn’t the most popular Pioneer deck choice of the weekend, it did win two of the four events. Both Pok Man Chan in Hong Kong and NAME in Shanghai piloted the deck to their first-place wins.

It was an upending weekend for the Pioneer metagame and the Top 8. Favorite Rakdos Midrange only qualified a single player – Man Lok Wong who placed second in Hong Kong – while surprises like Lotus Field Combo, Izzet Control, and Mono-Red Fires also qualified players for the Pro Tour.

Gruul Vehicles was another unexpected winner this weekend, seeing a jump in popularity among the Regional Championship players compared to previous events and winning the event in Shenzhen piloted by NAME.

<p>The last year of competitive <i>Magic</i> has been like many before it: unpredictable. As we navigated a busy field of online events and the leadup to <a href="https://magic.gg/events/magic-world-championship-xxviii" target="_blank"><i>Magic</i> World Championship XXVIII</a>, no one—including among our coverage insiders—saw <a href="https://magic.gg/news/the-week-that-was-the-greatest-steuer-ever-told" target="_blank">Nathan Steuer emerging as the best player at the World Championship</a> (though I have to say it wasn't long before it became clear what we were witnessing).</p>

<p>Steuer's victory at the <i>Magic</i> 30 festival was a taste of what's to come in 2023. It's almost a month out from <a href="https://mcphiladelphia.mtgfestivals.com/" target="_blank">MagicCon: Philadelphia</a>, and the atmosphere at the World Championship in Las Vegas was electric as more than 10,000 attended the event that played host to Steuer's run. We'll be running that back even bigger in Philadelphia as it serves as the major kickoff for the 2023 Pro Tour season, though we've actually been filling seats at the 2023 <i>Magic</i> World Championship for the last few months via the Regional Championships.</p>

<p>But I don't want to get too far ahead of myself. Let's back up a little bit and set the stage here. After all, in just a few weeks we'll hit the content cycle for Pro Tour <i>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</i> in Philladelphia and it'll be off to the races.</p>

<p>Let's take stock of where things stand on the path to the Pro Tour.</p>

<h1>What Would You Say You Do Around Here?</h1>

<p>Along with <a href="https://magic.gg/news/metagame-mentor-the-top-15-pioneer-decks-from-regional-championships" target="_blank">Frank Karsten and the Metagame Mentor column</a>, I'm back in 2023 with The Week That Was. <a href="https://magic.gg/news/the-week-that-was-with-a-cherryxman-on-top" target="_blank">As I wrote here</a> in my first weekly column, The Week That Was column years ago originally written by Brian David-Marshall was what hooked me on competitive <i>Magic.</i> I followed along every week for the latest format updates and stories of players who went from their local FNM and made a breakthrough at the next level. I could see that path for myself, and when my own breaks came later it was in part because I saw the ways it was possible.</p>

<p>We're almost six months into these columns and the time has flown. I think we've been able to recapture some of that feeling. To put it frankly, we've never had better metagame analysis than you'll find in Frank's columns, and I love that the weekly flow and rejuvenated tournament circuits around the world has given us a solid string of new and returning faces to competitive <i>Magic</i> to feature. You can expect more of the same in 2023 as The Week That Was returns to the Pro Tour.</p>

<h1>Looking Back</h1>

<p>Thanks to the regional format of the, well, Regional Championships, it's easy for players in one part of the world to miss updates from another since large, high-stakes tournaments have been happening all over, but we've actually been on quite the sprint over the past three months. We just wrapped the final Regional Championship in China to help set the field for the Pro Tour in Philadelphia and the World Championship at the end of the season. Throw in a handful of big online events and you have one of the busiest three-month stretches of high-level <i>Magic</i> we've seen in years.</p>

<p>Some numbers to put it in perspective.</p>

<ul>
	<li>2,900+ players competed in Regional Championships (that's <i>a lot</i> of Pioneer decklists!)</li>
	<li>162 invitations to Pro Tour <i>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</i></li>
	<li>13 invitations to <i>Magic</i> World Championship XXIX</li>
	<li>And at least former champion <a href="https://twitter.com/Mengu09/status/1594393239754113024" target="_blank">enjoying the ride</a></li>
</ul>

<p>All of that is a table-setter for what's to come this year. And while the particulars of high-level <i>Magic</i> have changed over the last few years, everyone who has competed in these Regional Championships has done so in pursuit of one simple goal—dream—that has driven players to shuffle up sixty since that first Pro Tour almost 30 years ago in New York.</p>

<p>Play <i>Magic</i>, see the world, win the Pro Tour.</p>

<p>Each of those 2,900-plus decklists isn't just a datapoint for a metagame calculator. They represent players like you and me who had a good run at Friday Night <i>Magic</i> or Game Day and wondered if we could take the next step. Each of those nearly 3,000 <i>Magic</i> players across the world moved from prereleases to FNM to Regional Championship qualifiers, and their dedication led them here and gave them the opportunity to fulfill those Pro Tour dreams.</p>

<p>Which brings me to Brandon Ortiz.</p>

<p>He's one of those players who has put the work in for years without a chance to shine. He first picked up <i>Magic</i> in 2009 and began playing competitive in 2016. For six years he worked to level up his game, moving through the ranks of his local scene on the way up through his region. His hard work culminated in a Regional Championship qualification, and he traveled along with 112 other players to Mexico City for The Gathering Showdown Series that served as the Regional Championship for Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean.</p>

<p>But he did a lot more than that.</p>

<p>I said qualifying for the Regional Championship was the culmination of Ortiz's work. Well, that was until the tournament started. Once it did, his unorthodox choice of Keruga Fires proved perfect for the late-season Pioneer metagame that had warped to beat Mono-Green Devotion and compete against Rakdos Midrange. He took the field by surprise and in fact ran into the <auto-card>Fires of Invention</auto-card> mirror in the finals against Alonso Mijares, where Ortiz accomplished something he has dreamed of for more than half a decade: a major title and an invitation to the World Championship.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Congratulations to both finalists, and to The Gathering Showdown Series champion Brandon Ortiz! <br><br>See you at Pro Tour I in Philly! <a href="https://t.co/AF739ffKQi">https://t.co/AF739ffKQi</a></p>&mdash; PlayMTG (@PlayMTG) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayMTG/status/1604631747731374080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 19, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>"I was very happy with my deck selection; my prediction worked," Ortiz explained. "I was expecting a lot of Rakdos and Mono-White, which I thought Keruga Fires had the tools to win fairly easily. I ended up beating four Rakdos Midrange decks and one Mono-White between the Swiss rounds and the Top 8 matches. After this, my goals for <i>Magic</i> in 2023 are to playing more competitive events to prepare for the Pro Tour and World Championship so I can have the best performance I possibly can."</p>

===decklistId:Keruga_Fires_Brandon_Ortiz_Regional_Championship_December 17, 2022_3f9788aa-7b68-4ae1-923b-d01886ad4336===

<p>Ortiz's victory gives him the exclamation point on his <i>Magic</i> resume, but it also revealed something about the Pioneer metagame that has become clear over the last few months: it's a lot more open than people initially perceived when fears of a <auto-card>Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx</auto-card>-dominated format abounded. Mono-Green Devotion proved defeatable, and it was a nice surprise to finish out 2022 with a pair of peripheral decks meeting in the finals of a big event. As Frank pointed out in his article, most of the decks in the format hovered near a 50% win rate, meaning that skill with a particular archetype was more important than any other edge possible.</p>

<h1>Looking Ahead</h1>

<p>Ortiz joins the dozen or so other players who have guaranteed themselves a seat at the World Championship later this year. You can start your own path to the Pro Tour with store-level RCQs; you can find tournaments on the <a href="https://locator.wizards.com/search?searchType=magic-events&amp;tag=regional_championship_qualifier&amp;query=Los%20Angeles,%20CA,%20USA&amp;distance=100&amp;page=1&amp;sort=date&amp;sortDirection=asc" target="_blank">Store and Event Locator</a> or your <a href="https://magic.gg/pro-tour?section=regional-championships#pro-tour" target="_blank">regional organizer's website</a>. RCQs through April 3, 2023 will feed into the third cycle of Regional Championships.</p>

<p>But first, the Pro Tour. I expect the hype level for <a href="https://mcphiladelphia.mtgfestivals.com" target="_blank">MagicCon: Philadelphia</a> Feb. 17-19 and the triumphant return of the paper PT and everything that comes with it at Pro Tour <i>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</i>. Personally, I'm looking forward to the first major international tabletop "Gathering" in three years featuring high-level tabletop competition.</p>

<p>One of the best parts of the Pro Tour circuit is the connections you make with diverse people across the world, and like everyone I've missed my friends from other places around the world. Philladelphia, here we come!</p>

<p>Just make sure you've seen <i>Rocky</i> before you show up.</p>

With 14 rounds of Pioneer standing between them and an invite to Pro Tour Philadelphia, as well as a World Championship invite for first place, players braced themselves for a weekend of grueling high-stakes Magic. When the dust settled it was Christian Trudel coming out on top, putting on a dominant 9-0 performance on the second day to win it all with Mono-Green Devotion.

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/7EegugCdcgk5uBVNQWYj23/4d3bf74204f0debeddeb33d838174128/f2f-champion.jpg" /><p class="embedImageCaption">Congratulations to Christian Trudel!</p></div></div><br />

Trudel faced Jordan Tebby on Rakdos Midrange in the finals, a rematch of Round 12 of the Swiss. History repeated itself as Trudel won both matches handily, earning himself the title of Regional Champion. When asked about his deck choice, Trudel praised Mono-Green for being “overwhelmingly powerful” and believed the metagame may have overreacted by shifting away from the archetype so quickly.

The Top 8 players from the Toronto Tour Championship also earned invites to the Pro Tour at MagicCon: Philadelphia in February 2023. Congratulations, and we look forward to seeing you represent Canada at the Pro Tour.

# HALFWAY THERE

The FaceToFace Tour Weekend in Toronto featured a lot of amazing Magic, but it is not the end of the Cycle for the Canadian region. With the region’s invites being split among two events, it is going to be the upcoming Tour Championship in Calgary that will determine the other 8 Pro Tour Competitors (and one more World Championship Competitor!) for Canada. Players competing in the event will want to pay close attention to the metagame breakdown from this past weekend:

Two weeks ago the first F2F Tour Championship, in Toronto, qualified eight players for Pro Tour I in Philadelphia, and winner Christian Trudel also earned a seat at the World Championship.

At the western Championship, players competed in fourteen rounds of Pioneer before cutting to the Top 8, where Joseph Karani, piloting Rakdos Midrange, emerged victorious.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Surrounded by friends, a very emotional Joseph Karani from Winnipeg Manitoba takes down the F2F Tour Championship in Calgary. He will be representing Canada at the MTG World Championships.

Karani earned invites to both Pro Tour I in Philadelphia, as well as the World Championship. Congratulations to Joseph Karani, Canada’s second Regional Champion!

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/3BDJFoyMtXJMdGEy1bEQUq/41115c39d26bd8e51c766e9786385a85/F2F-Tour-Championship-Calgary-Winner.jpg" /><p class="embedImageCaption">Congratulations to Joseph Karani!</p></div></div><br />

Karani, who hails from wintery Winnipeg, defeated Michael Knie on Abzan Greasefang in the finals. It was yet another successful showing for Rakdos Midrange, which has toppled Mono-Green Devotion and other challengers like Mono-White Humans as the most popular deck as the first cycle of Regional Championships has progressed.

# Shaking Up the Top 8

While Karani emerged victorious with Rakdos Midrange, the weekend also marked a comeback for Mono-Green Devotion, which put two copies into the Top 8 after slipping in popularity from the start of the cycle. Abzan Greasefang also made a strong showing, similarly putting two copies into the Top 8.

The biggest surprise, though, was Scott Polsky’s Golgari Elves, which he played to a Top 4 finish.

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/1fFArO5i4XmToE59S8IB7f/e52c0b257000a90b4aa9296b51c29989/f2fc-top8.jpg" /><p class="embedImageCaption">Congratulations to Dan Snider, Joseph Karani, Chris Carlile, Michael Knie, Scott Polsky, Violet Davies, Cameron Sweetnam, and Daniel Fournier</p></div></div><br />

The Top 8 players from the F2F Tour Championship earned qualifications to Pro Tour I at MagicCon Philadelphia in February 2023. Congratulations, and we look forward to following your competitive journeys next year!

And while the Top 8 reflected some decks finally breaking through into Pioneer success this cycle, the metagame continues to reflect Rakdos Midrange’s rise to the top. The breadth of decks in the Top 8, however, confirms that the Pioneer format still has plenty of room for surprises and niche strategies.

The championship match was a Rakdos mirror, with runner-up Kyosuke Kyogoku also piloting what was, quite comfortably, the most popular deck at the tournament. The mirror broke the way of Hirayama, however, who dispatched Kyogoku 2-0 in the final and claimed the Champions Cup as his own. Kyogoku didn't go home empty-handed, however - both finalists received an invitation to the next World Championship.

The Top 8 was dominated by Rakdos midrange, with six players making it through with the black-red deck. Mono-Green and Azorius Control made brief appearances in the Top 8, but the story of the weekend was definitely the dominance of Rakdos.

As for the players in the Top 8, some huge names from the region stepped up and secured their slots at the next Pro Tour, including two Hall of Famers: both Shuhei Nakamuras and Shota Yasooka proved they've still got it, ending up first and third, respectively, after the Swiss rounds.

While Rakdos was immensely popular (and immensely successful) in Tokoname, plenty of other decks were widely represented at the tournament. Interestingly, Azorius Control was the third-most-played deck at the Champions Cup, outstripping even Izzet Phoenix and putting two copies into the top 12.

Aside from the Regional Championship tournament itself, the event also saw hundreds of people take part in side events of all kinds. From brand-new ways to play <i>Magic</i>, such as Jumpstart, to the oldest cards in the game doing battle in Vintage, the Champions Cup was a celebration of in-person play, a wonderful example of the gathering we've all missed so much.

It's fitting that as we are celebrating holidays right now that players have seen fit to leave some surprises underneath the tree.</p>

<p>If that tree is the Pioneer format, anyway. The metaphor only goes so far—the point is that we've completed another week of Regional Championships played out across Pioneer, and we have yet another innovative deck winning the events in the hands of a worthy champion. Another curveball in a year full of them, all setting the stage perfectly for the first Pro Tour of 2023 at <a href="https://mcphiladelphia.mtgfestivals.com/en-us.html" target="_blank">MagicCon: Philadelphia</a>.</p>

<p>I should probably back up a little—forgive me but it's easy to get on a roll here at The Week That Was headquarters when we've nearly wrapped what was (for me at least) a true comeback year for <i>Magic</i>'s most enduring quality: the thrill of playing high-stakes tabletop <i>Magic</i> against the best in the world.</p>

<p>Over the past 12 months, players have competed across the world in Regional Championship Qualifiers, aiming to win the local tournament that sends them to one of a host of Regional Championships spread across the globe. Those tournaments bring together the best in the area to compete with truly huge stakes: Pro Tour invitations, yes, but for this string of events <i>World</i> Championship invites as well.</p>

<p>The path is laid out again, a clear line from jamming games of <i>Magic</i> with buddies or on <i>MTG Arena</i> or at the draft tables of Friday Night <i>Magic</i>. The Pro Tour pipeline is flowing, and the Regional Championships of the past six weeks (one remains to be played in China) have been a real throwback to the days of near-weekly Grand Prix. I came into <i>Magic</i> reading Brian David-Marshall writing The Week That Was and recapping the previous weekend's events—getting featured in coverage was an aspirational goal for everyone at my local store who was showing me the ropes. So it's been really fun to document these tournaments in the same way now, as we restart the Pro Tour and fill the ranks of the stories we'll be telling for the 12 months to come.</p>

<p>And there's been plenty of them, too many to list but all documenting the same dream.</p>

<p>Most recently, it was <a href="https://magic.gg/news/the-week-that-was-champions-return-to-the-pro-tour" target="_blank">Joseph Karani at the F2F Tour</a> in Canada punching his ticket to the show. A veteran of the previously mentioned Grand Prix circuit—he won GP Indianapolis in 2019—Karani found himself in the position many of us did this year: checking the calendar to see if we can squeeze in another qualifier. And in the case of one Matias Leveratto, that calendar gave me him exactly one weekend to qualify (which he did). My Twitter feed is once again filled with round-by-round record updates and posts giving the latest blow-by-blow of the tournament, from the bad beats stories to the winner's trophy shot.</p>

<p>And it's given us moments like this:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Surrounded by friends, a very emotional Joseph Karani from Winnipeg Manitoba takes down the F2F Tour Championship in Calgary. He will be representing Canada at the MTG World Championships.

<p>One of the storylines I haven't gotten a chance to devote as much space to is the evolution of the Pioneer metagame over this run. It's pretty rare for a format to get put through its paces quite so severely with such sustained pressure. But with the Regional Championships all slated for Pioneer—which looks a heck of a lot different than the last time it did in a tabletop Pro Tour level tournament—we didn't know exactly what we were getting into, even if we knew (more or less) what the top decks of the format were, with <auto-card>Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx</auto-card> and its monster Green decks leading the way.</p>

<p>When this happens, things tend to go one of a few ways: things can coalesce into a singular "best deck" (Cawblade, famously). Or we can get the classic rock-paper-scissors metagame (where, for instance, Ramunap Red beats Blue-Black Control but loses to Temur Energy, which was itself weak to Blue-Black).</p>

<p>Or we can get a kind of third route, where the format more or less settles around a handful of diverse decks with no true hierarchy—I think of it more as "tiers" than anything else, with a major feature being the ability of a deck to move up or down the tiers based on the pilot and the pairings. Any Given Sunday, so to speak, for you American football fans. The halcyon days of exploring the then-new Modern metagame back in the day are probably the best example of this, but Pioneer in 2022 is giving off some of those same vibes to someone who has been following results religiously for the past two months.</p>

<p>Which, by the way, you can as well! My column mate Frank Karsten covers the week-to-week shifts of the format and the impact of new sets (<i>The Brothers War</i> has made its impact felt). <a href="https://magic.gg/news/metagame-mentor-the-final-pioneer-update-for-2022" target="_blank">Check out Frank's column for more</a>.</p>

<p>When the Regional Championship season opened up, we found out very quickly that it wasn't exactly a Devotion world the rest of us were living in. In fact, Rakdos Midrange kicked things off with a bang—victory in the first set of events—and despite several other decks including Mono-Green Devotion picking up wins it was the traditional Rakdos route of doing Rakdos things we've seen over the past few years of online events.</p>

<p>But just like I did when I scanned all those BDM articles back in the day, I know it's not the traditional value deck you're looking for—it's the brews that can take a tournament by surprise and maybe punch a Pro Tour ticket while you're at it.</p>

<p>Which brings me to Brandon Ortiz. And back to <i>Throne of Eldraine.</i></p>

<p>You might remember a little enchantment that played a very big role across several formats.</p>

<magic-cards>
  Fires of Invention
</magic-cards>

<p>It's back. In a big way. In fact, <a href="https://magic.gg/news/mexicos-brandon-ortiz-earns-trophy-at-the-gathering-showdown-series" target="_blank">Ortiz's victory at The Gathering Showdown Series</a> (the Mexico City Regional Championship), featured a <auto-card>Fires of Invention</auto-card> mirror match, with Alonso Mijares' <auto-card>Enigmatic Incarnation</auto-card> take on <auto-card>Fires of Invention</auto-card> no less significant than Ortiz's "traditional" <auto-card>Fires of Invention</auto-card> list featuring more <i>Eldraine</i> throwbacks like <auto-card>Kenrith, the Returned King</auto-card> and <auto-card>Bonecrusher Giant</auto-card> (not to mention the elemental blob responsible for the most groans in landfall history: <auto-card>Omnath, Locus of Creation</auto-card>).</p>

<p>I use the word significant because of what this particular mana-cheating mirror represents: a challenger appearing. As Frank predicted, the rise of Rakdos Midrange—which could slow down the haymakers from Devotion just enough while interacting favorably with much of the format—led to a subsequent rise in decks that could go over the top of all that fair <i>Magic,</i> and the result is another evolution in the Pioneer metagame. Not bad for a format getting tackled by an entire world of hungry competitors. All of this rewards players keenly following the week-to-week Regional Championship developments (or at least people who read Frank's column!).</p>

<p>So what's next? <auto-card>Fires of Invention</auto-card> strategies certainly has its own weaknesses. Can Rakdos adapt to shift the matchup enough to stay atop the metagame, or will this fundamentally alter how players approach deck selection moving forward? We've got one more Regional Championship left to sort things out before we tie a bow on the format for 2022 and look toward the Pro Tour in Philadelphia and the next Regional Championship qualifying cycle.</p>

<p>The week-to-week flow of high-level tabletop tournaments is back, and it's been a fun ride to chronicle in my first year helming The Week That Was. Speaking of, I'm excited to say Frank and I will be back for 2023!</p>

<h1>Looking Ahead</h1>

<p>Speaking of 2023, remember it's not just the Pro Tour the Regional Championships are leading toward—there's <i>Magic</i> World Championship XXIX spots on the line every weekend.</p>

<p>The Regional Championship in China is scheduled for this weekend, and it at least begin to tell us more about the answers to these questions, but who knows? <auto-card>Feed the Swarm</auto-card> exists. There's no telling how things will develop before the Pro Tour. That's what keeps it fun!</p>

<p>Once we flip the calendar, the first Pro Tour of the year comes up very quickly. Pro Tour <i>Phyrexia: All is One</i> is <a href="https://mcphiladelphia.mtgfestivals.com/" target="_blank">February 17-19 at MagicCon: Philadelphia</a>, and that means that players will begin congregating at Pro Tour testing houses just a little over a month from now. Get your holiday Cube drafts in while you can; I'll see you in the queues!</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Metagame Mentor: The Final Pioneer Update for 2022</title><link>https://magic.gg/news/metagame-mentor-the-final-pioneer-update-for-2022</link><guid>https://magic.gg/news/metagame-mentor-the-final-pioneer-update-for-2022</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>Hello and welcome back to Metagame Mentor, your weekly guide to the top decks and latest Constructed developments on the path to the Pro Tour. Today, I'll cover the Regional Championships for the West Canada and Mexico/Central America/Caribbean regions. The format for these tournaments, held on December 10-11 and December 17-18 respectively, was Pioneer.</p>

<p>Top eligible players from these Regional Championships earned an invitation to the first Pro Tour in 2023, called Pro Tour Phyrexia: All Is One and held during <a href="https://mcphiladelphia.mtgfestivals.com/content/sitebuilder/rna/mtg-festivals/global/en-us/magiccon-news/magiccon-philadelphia-the-lineup.html" target="_blank">MagicCon: Philadelphia</a> on February 17-19. But you don't have to be qualified for the Pro Tour to enjoy this festival, as it offers something for everyone. You can take a picture with The Weatherlight, attend panels with special guests, participate in a Limited PTQ that qualifies directly for the second Pro Tour in May, and so on. MagicCon: Philadelphia celebrates all things <i>Magic: The Gathering</i>, and it has double the space of MagicCon: Vegas. Don't miss out on your ticket!</p>

<p>Over the last few Regional Championship weekends, Rakdos Midrange was the most popular deck by far, and this global trend continued in Canada. Joseph Karani touted the deck's consistency, high card quality, and raw power of <auto-card>Sheoldred, the Apocalypse</auto-card>: "Card's busted."</p>

<p>A relatively new trend for Rakdos Midrange is the inclusion of main deck <auto-card>Reckoner Bankbuster</auto-card>. The vehicle helps grind in the attrition-heavy mirror matches, and it's well-positioned in a metagame where Rakdos Midrange is the most popular deck. You have to be ready for the mirror match, and <auto-card>Reckoner Bankbuster</auto-card> helps with that.</p>

<p>Semifinalist Daniel Fournier even ran the four copies of <auto-card>Reckoner Bankbuster</auto-card> in <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/263334" target="_blank">his 75</a>. "It's a split card <auto-card>Heart of Kiran</auto-card> // <auto-card>Ancestral Recall</auto-card>," he explained. "Only it has fuse."</p>

<p><auto-card>Fires of Invention</auto-card> essentially doubles up your mana while allowing you to spend your lands on <auto-card>Kenrith, the Returned King</auto-card>'s activated abilities. Decks based around this enchantment were a good choice for the metagame, and the finals in Mexico City was a <auto-card>Fires of Invention</auto-card> mirror match! In the finals, Brandon Ortiz's Keruga Fires defeated Alonso Mijares' <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/265521" target="_blank">Enigmatic Fires</a>, but both players got there by cleverly trying to target the most popular deck in the metagame.</p>

<p>To regular readers of this column, this shouldn't come as a surprise. <a href="https://www.magic.gg/news/metagame-mentor-the-quadruple-regional-championship-weekend" target="_blank">Three weeks ago</a>, I wrote: "If [Rakdos Midrange] remains on top, then I'd expect players to flock towards <auto-card>Fires of Invention</auto-card>; <auto-card>Skysovereign, Consul Flagship</auto-card>; or other cards that line up well." <a href="https://www.magic.gg/news/metagame-mentor-pioneer-at-the-south-america-and-chinese-taipei-regional-championships" target="_blank">Two weeks ago</a>, I reinforced that the black and red part of the color pie is traditionally weak to enchantments and that <auto-card>Fires of Invention</auto-card> is one of the best ways to overpower Rakdos Midrange.</p>

<p>Between the two variants, Enigmatic Fires had a higher winrate against the field as a whole and feels more intrinsically powerful, but Keruga Fires may be favored in the head-to-head. In any case, the key lesson to take away is that Rakdos Midrange, like any archetype in Pioneer, is beatable, and <auto-card>Fires of Invention</auto-card> is a good way to do so.</p>

<h1>The Metagame and Win Rates</h1>

<p>Based on all decklists from the two Regional Championships held over the past two weekends, I determined the combined metagame share of every archetype. I also calculated their non-mirror, non-bye, non-draw match win rates. I used my own algorithms and definitions to assign archetype labels, thereby sidestepping any potential mislabeling on MTG Melee. Let's take a look!</p>

<p>The overall metagame at these Regional Championships was quite similar to <a href="https://www.magic.gg/news/metagame-mentor-pioneer-at-the-south-america-and-chinese-taipei-regional-championships" target="_blank">the one from earlier this month</a>, showing that regional metagame differences are relatively small. <i>Magic</i> is a global game indeed. The most notable development is an uptick in Gruul Vehicles, including a new variant with main deck <auto-card>Werewolf Pack Leader</auto-card>, while Izzet Phoenix and Azorius Control plunged somewhat.</p>

<p>In terms of win rates against the field, Gruul Vehicles stands out positively again. Mono-Black Midrange, which can be summarized as Rakdos Midrange with <auto-card>Gifted Aetherborn</auto-card> and <auto-card>Invoke Despair</auto-card> instead of <auto-card>Bloodtithe Harvester</auto-card> and <auto-card>Fable of the Mirror-Breaker</auto-card>, is a promising newcomer too. However, sample sizes are small. For example, for Rakdos Midrange the data gives <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_proportion_confidence_interval#Clopper%E2%80%93Pearson_interval" target="_blank">95% confidence</a> that its true win rate against the field lies in the interval from 47.5% and 56.7%. Due to this wide range, it's hard to draw significant conclusions about performance.</p>

<p>The only exception is Izzet Phoenix, which has really been struggling lately, especially against Rakdos Midrange or Mono-White Humans. The raw power of its engine is still there, and the deck can still excel in the hands of a world-class technical player. Nevertheless, the current metagame is hostile to graveyards due to the presence of <auto-card>Go Blank</auto-card>, <auto-card>Rest in Peace</auto-card>, and so on. This means that Izzet Phoenix may need to reinvent itself or wait until the metagame cycles back to a more favorable spot.</p>

<h1>Spice Corner</h1>

<p>Although the top tables at Pioneer tournaments will largely be populated by Rakdos Midrange, Mono-Green Devotion, and Mono-White Humans, there are many other innovations to pay attention to. It's always exciting to see brewers do well with their own creations, so let's check out the spiciest decks that earned a Pro Tour invite in Calgary or Mexico City.</p>

===decklistId:Esper_Greasefang_Michael_Knie_West_Canada_Regional_Championship_12_11_22_c14b4818-64cf-45a4-a7fe-23428c6fb974===

<p>While Abzan Greasefang remains the most popular combo deck in Pioneer, Michael Knie had been playing his Esper combo-control variant since <i>Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty</i>. Rather than green self-mill cards, he relies on discard effects to put <auto-card>Parhelion II</auto-card> into the graveyard. Also, his list has no backup aggro/midrange plan, as it doesn't include <auto-card>Ledger Shredder</auto-card> or Raffine's Informant. Instead, he has a control plan with <auto-card>Faithful Mending</auto-card>, <auto-card>Collective Brutality</auto-card>, and <auto-card>Supreme Verdict</auto-card>. With his fresh take on the Greasefang strategy, Michael Knie felt he had to prove how viable and good it really is.</p>

<p>And prove it he did. With a second-place finish at the Regional Championship in Calgary, Michael Knie proved that Greasefang decks don't need to be Abzan and don't need an aggro/midrange backup plan.</p>

<p>"Splinter Twin was one of the most powerful archetypes in Modern, and it was a control-combo shell," he explained in his <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V3mMeRF-7g7AAmJOeUq3tK7Msu92sp-b6zkBrto7hr8/edit" target="_blank">tournament report</a>. "Therefore I believed that I could leverage playing control in a combo shell with Greasefang ... it is just my philosophy as a player and how I saw I could attack the Pioneer format."</p>

<p>To me, accomplishments like these show that Pioneer remains underexplored and that Esper Greasefang, when built correctly, is at least on equal footing with Abzan Greasefang.</p>

===decklistId:Gruul_Vehicles_Violet_Davies_West_Canada_Regional_Championship_12_11_22_df14d329-5bfe-4492-98f8-6e921f5e06b6===

<p>Over the course of the Regional Championship season, Gruul Vehicles has emerged as a top-tier strategy that is well-positioned against Rakdos Midrange and Mono-White Humans. While most builds have looked alike with little innovation, Violet Davies showed that there is another way to succeed with a <auto-card>Karplusan Forest</auto-card> deck: by curving <auto-card>Werewolf Pack Leader</auto-card> into <auto-card>Reckless Stormseeker</auto-card>.</p>

<p>The addition of the double-green card, which replaced a combination of <auto-card>Scavenging Ooze</auto-card> and <auto-card>The Akroan War</auto-card> in the "stock" Gruul Vehicles list, required a few cuts: several <auto-card>Mutavault</auto-card> from the main deck and <auto-card>Jegantha, the Wellspring</auto-card> from the sideboard. Even though these cuts hurt, <auto-card>Werewolf Pack Leader</auto-card> provides a more aggressive stance, which is particularly important against decks like Abzan Greasefang or <auto-card>Lotus Field</auto-card> combo where speed is of the essence.</p>

<p>With this novel take on the archetype, <a href="https://twitter.com/aquibian/status/1602359150922854400" target="_blank">Violet Davies</a> finished in the Top 8 of the Regional Championship in Calgary. A player best known as <a href="https://twitter.com/_HappySandwich/status/1603141242417733639" target="_blank">HappySandwich</a> narrowly missed the Top 8 with almost the same list.</p>

<p>Having spent quite a bit of time on this archetype myself, I do believe that the loss of Jegantha hurts substantially against midrange or control decks, but <auto-card>Werewolf Pack Leader</auto-card> is a valid alternative approach in the right metagame. As suggestions to improve this version, I would consider adding <auto-card>Embercleave</auto-card> to the main deck, perhaps instead of an Esika's Chariot and <auto-card>Obliterating Bolt</auto-card>. This is inspired by fellow Hall of Famer <a href="https://www.mtgo.com/en/mtgo/decklist/pioneer-qualifier-2022-10-0112480040#deck_Edel" target="_blank">Willy Edel's version</a> that actually predates the emergence of the archetype as we know it today. In addition, I would tweak the mana base: I would cut <auto-card>Den of the Bugbear</auto-card> for <auto-card>Mountain</auto-card>, as you can't have <auto-card>Den of the Bugbear</auto-card> enter untapped if you cast turn two <auto-card>Werewolf Pack Leader</auto-card>, I would consider shaving another <auto-card>Mutavault</auto-card> for an additional colored lands if I add <auto-card>Embercleave</auto-card>, and I would balance the loss of the creature lands by adding more <auto-card>Lair of the Hydra</auto-card>.</p>

<p>Yet regardless of the exact build, Gruul Vehicles is a good way to prey on the dominance of Rakdos Midrange.</p>

===decklistId:Golgari_Elves_Scott_Polsky_West_Canada_Regional_Championship_12_11_22_4998935f-8fd7-4454-bc91-3bf3b36fd8f8===

<p>Elves ramps ahead with <auto-card>Elvish Mystic</auto-card> and <auto-card>Llanowar Elves</auto-card> in the early game, boosts the team with <auto-card>Elvish Clancaller</auto-card> and <auto-card>Leaf-Crowned Visionary</auto-card> in the mid-game, and wins by casting <auto-card>Chord of Calling</auto-card> for <auto-card>Shaman of the Pack</auto-card> in the late game.</p>

<p>Although the archetype had not seen much competitive success in Pioneer yet, Scott Polsky took his pet deck to the semifinals of the Regional Championship in Calgary, earning a Pro Tour invite. "Elves is the one deck I've played in every possible format from Pauper to Pioneer and Modern," he explained.</p>

<p>To me, this shows that Pioneer is a format where long-term deck familiarity is more important than raw deck strength. The advantage of picking a deck with a few more percentage points against the field in theory is relatively small, whereas deck-specific expertise can give a bigger edge. Experience with a deck will be particularly important when you face situations or matchups you've never seen before, as it helps you figure game plans and sideboard strategies on the fly. In that sense, Pioneer is closer to Modern than it is to Standard. In short, pick a deck you like, and get really good at it. It surely worked for Scott Polsky!</p>

<h1>Looking Ahead</h1>

<p>Due to COVID-19 restrictions, the Regional Championship in China was <a href="https://www.magic.gg/news/magic-china-open-season-1-finals-postponement" target="_blank">postponed</a> and is now scheduled to take place this coming weekend, split across four different locations. You can follow these four events on MTG Melee <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Tournament/View/12811" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Tournament/View/12812" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Tournament/View/12813" target="_blank">here</a>, and <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Tournament/View/12814" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>As this first round of Regional Championships is drawing to a close, let's put all the event types in the new organized play system into perspective, with an eye on 2023.</p>

<p>Working our way from the bottom to the top:</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>Regional Championship Qualifiers (RCQs)</b>: RCQs for the second round of Regional Championships are now in the rear-view window. After a holiday break, RCQs from January 7, 2023 through April 3, 2023 will feed the third round of Regional Championships. Don't miss your chance to qualify by finding tournaments on the <a href="https://locator.wizards.com/" target="_blank">Store &amp; Event Locator</a> or your <a href="https://magic.gg/pro-tour?section=regional-championships#pro-tour" target="_blank">regional organizer's website</a>.</li>
	<li><b>Regional Championships (RCs)</b>: The first round of these major events is almost over, but they happen three times per year. Each time, they are scheduled approximately one to three months before their corresponding Pro Tour. The second round of RCs, featuring the Standard format, takes place in February, March, or April 2023, depending on your region. The third round of RCs, featuring the Pioneer format, takes place in May, June, or July 2023.</li>
	<li><b>Pro Tours (PTs)</b>: The first Pro Tour in 2023, called Pro Tour Phyrexia: All Is One, will be held during MagicCon: Philadelphia on February 17-19. That's where you might see all the players whose decks I highlighted in today's article. The format for that Pro Tour will be Pioneer and <i>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</i> Draft. Subsequently, the second Pro Tour will be held during MagicCon: Minneapolis on May 5-7, and the third Pro Tour will be held at the MagicCon in Europe in July.</li>
	<li><b>World Championship</b>: <i>Magic</i> World Championship XXIX will be held on September 22-24, 2023 at MagicCon: Las Vegas. The field of competitors, who will vie for the total prize pool of $1,000,000, will extend to around 128 competitors. I've already congratulated several Regional Champions on their World Championship invite, and top finishers at future Regional Championships, Arena Championships, MOCS, and Pro Tours from the 2022-23 season will also be invited.</li>
</ul>

<p>High-level tabletop <i>Magic</i> is back, and it will be even better in 2023 with the return the Pro Tour. The first round of Regional Championships has shown the joy of returning to in-person tournaments and high-stakes competition. Top finishers paved their paths to the Pro Tour, pushed the Pioneer metagame forward, and will have the chance to test their mettle against the best of the best at Pro Tour Phyrexia: All Will Be One. Congratulations once again to all top finishers from the Regional Championships, and I look forward to following your competitive journeys next year!</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Mexico's Brandon Ortiz Earns Trophy at The Gathering Showdown Series</title><link>https://magic.gg/news/mexicos-brandon-ortiz-earns-trophy-at-the-gathering-showdown-series</link><guid>https://magic.gg/news/mexicos-brandon-ortiz-earns-trophy-at-the-gathering-showdown-series</guid><description><![CDATA[Last Saturday, 113 players from Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean gathered in Mexico City for The Gathering Showdown Series, the area’s Regional Championship and the culmination of months of qualifying events. After seven rounds of Swiss play and a Top 8 featuring some of the most interesting decks yet, it was Brandon Ortiz piloting Keruga Fires who emerged victorious.

Congratulations to Brandon Ortiz, winner of The Gathering Showdown Series!

Ortiz defeated Alonso Mijares on Enigmatic Fires in the Finals. It made for an exciting weekend for Fires of Invention, which, while present in the metagame, had yet to take down a Regional Championship–or even put a substantial number of copies into a Top 8. In addition to earning an invite to Pro Tour Phyrexia: All Will Be One at MagicCon: Philadelphia in February, Ortiz also earned a seat at next year’s Magic World Championship XXIX.

# A TOP 8 OF SURPRISES

Despite the rise of Rakdos Midrange at previous Regional Championships–and the fact that it once again had the largest individual share of the metagame–it put only a single copy into the Top 8.

Ahead of Top 8 play Mono-White Humans was the metagame winner of the weekend, with two copies in the Top 8. Ultimately though, the Fires of Invention decks that had struggled to take down any previous Regional Championships showed that the Pioneer metagame is still evolving.

# FORWARD TO THE PRO TOUR

Ortiz and Mijares both earned invitations to the first Pro Tour next year in February 2023. As the second to last weekend of the first cycle of Regional Championships, with only China’s remaining, Ortiz and Mijares are among the final players to join the growing Pro Tour field.

# MAGICCON: PHILADELPHIA APPROACHES

The past six weeks of Regional Championships have given players around the world an opportunity to get back to in-person Magic, and this first cycle soon culminates in the first Pro Tour of the new season at MagicCon: Philadelphia. The Gathering Showdown Series was yet another culmination of great play at the local and regional level, and we can’t wait to see players at the Pro Tour and Magic World Championship.

<p>All about it, in fact. He's been there. Under the brightest lights in the biggest <i>Magic</i> tournament of his life, Leveratto performed. He famously beat Brad Nelson in <a href="https://www.magic.gg/news/a-champions-path-back-to-magic" target="_blank">the finals of a Mythic Championship in 2019</a>, capping a near-miraculous return to high-level play. To win that tournament (and subsequently qualify for the Rivals League, something he considers one of his greatest <i>Magic</i> accomplishments), Leveratto faced down the odds again and again on his way to victory. It was one of the most enjoyable success stories of the <i>Arena</i> era to follow, and demonstrated that the dream was still alive for someone to come back to the game after years away and rise all the way to the top of the Mythic Championship.</p>

<p>So it won't surprise you to find out that Leveratto defied the odds again in his return to the Pro Tour in 2022. After all—here at <a href="https://magic.gg/news/the-week-that-was-making-it-to-the-big-stage" target="_blank">The Week That Was</a> you're used to hearing stories of players overcoming long odds to make Pro Tour dreams come true.</p>

<p>But even grading on that curve, <i>this</i> particular Leveratto story jumped out to me, for degree of difficulty if nothing else.</p>

<p>"When the return of physical tournaments and the Pro Tour were finally announced, I knew that my goal was to qualify again," he began.</p>

<p><i>So far, so good.</i></p>

<p>"Unfortunately, the qualifying season for the Regional Championship took place at the time that I had gone to live three months abroad," he continued.</p>

<p><i>Uh-oh. That doesn't sound great.</i></p>

<p>"But I was lucky enough to at least have one chance—I was returning one day before the last weekend of Regional Championship Qualifiers."</p>

<p>A "quick" plane ride across the globe brought Leveratto home in the nick of time, and jet lag fighting for space with sideboard guides in the champion's brain, he was at the table, finally. A deck and a chair.</p>

<p>"In the end I managed to qualify by winning a Modern RCQ playing Living End," Leveratto finished.</p>

===decklistId:Rakdos_Midrange_Matias_Leveratto_South_America_Regional_Championship_12_3_2022_51c81022-d656-41c4-9d38-afbbb07c28b3===

<p>That's <i>Magic</i> under pressure. And it's what brought Leveratto back to the Pro Tour after his recent Top 4 finish at the South America <i>Magic</i> Series Regional Championship (<a href="https://magic.gg/news/alejandro-sepulveda-reigns-supreme-at-south-america-magic-series-santiago">ultimately won by Alejandro Sepulveda</a>).</p>

<p>Next up is the Pro Tour at <a href="https://mcphiladelphia.mtgfestivals.com/en-us.html" target="_blank">MagicCon: Philadelphia</a>. For Leveratto, it's a tournament three years in the making.</p>

<p>"This comes after having managed to establish myself in the professional circuit and qualify for the Rivals League, and I was very excited to travel around the world—one of the things I like the most—and compete together with my friends Sebastian Pozzo and Luis Salvatto. 2020 was going to be a great year, it started with the Worlds Championship in Hawaii and I was already planning the rest of the year. Covid arrived and ruined all I had in mind. All the tournaments became online and the possibility of traveling the and sharing experiences with many players from all over the world was put on hold."</p>

<p>Now Leveratto is back. He's one of dozens of players across the world who have qualified for the first Pro Tour of 2023 with their performances in Regional Championships. The past five weeks have been a wild sprint through the Pioneer format as players punch their ticket back to the PT while at the same time pushing Pioneer forward with successive high-quality events.</p>

<p>The stakes are meaningful, and players have responded in kind. We've seen the return of <a href="https://magic.gg/news/the-week-that-was-many-hands-make-qualifying-light-work" target="_blank">"Pro Tour" houses</a> and teams have formed across the world to dissect the previous weekend's results and put in the work to prepare for a field trying to one-up last week's Top 8. As Leveratto put it, the Regional Championships are a perfect glimpse into what the Pro Tour will look like.</p>

<p>"The Regional Championship in Chile was a mini-preview of what the Pro Tour could be, since I traveled to compete with several of my friends from Argentina," he explained. "I've been playing Rakdos Sac in Pioneer for months now and it's the deck I used to win the Mana Traders' tournament in October, so I felt pretty confident. In any case, I knew that it was going to be very difficult because it was going to be a very big tournament and that it only distributed four places for the Pro Tour. But despite the difficulties that we always have in Latin America to compete in the professional circuit, do not give up. Far from discouraging me, that motivated me to try to classify and be able to LATAM at the top and show that due to the level of play we deserve more opportunities.</p>

<p>"Now that I have qualified for the Pro Tour, my objective is going to be to prepare myself like never before to try to reach the top."</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Top4!!!!!!<br>🔥🧙‍♂️🖤♥️<br><br>I qualify for the ProTour 🤗🇦🇷 <a href="https://t.co/MdLCQNBy4K">https://t.co/MdLCQNBy4K</a></p>&mdash; Levunga | MT8 (@levunga) <a href="https://twitter.com/levunga/status/1599485364762091521?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 4, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>We'll see Leveratto again in Philly after his epic Rakdos run. And with thousands of players across the world keeping a keen eye out to take in the results, the South America Regional Championship set the stage for what was to come half a world away a week later.</p>

<h1>Meanwhile, In The Other Hemisphere...</h1>

<p>Joseph Karani was one of those players anxiously awaiting the latest tournament decklists. (I suggest <a href="https://magic.gg/news/metagame-mentor-standard-and-modern-with-the-brothers-war" target="_blank">Frank Karsten's column for that</a>.) Karani is the rare player who gains more from theory-crafting and analyzing formats than he does slamming hundreds of practice games, and the numbers coming out of South America only furthered what he had come to believe after watching Regional Championship results roll in from North America, Europe, and Asia in the preceding weeks: Rakdos Midrange was the deck to play.</p>

<p>"There's no amount of testing one person can do to get a full understanding of a format the way you can with following the results over the course of hundreds or thousands of games," he explained. "Too many players will focus on hard testing. What I want to do is the mental reps of the matchups with a look at the data.</p>

<p>"Before this tournament, I watched all the Regional Championship coverage I could find. I watched the games and studied them and digested the data. The way I approach <i>Magic,</i> I don't have time to test all the time, so in the week leading up to the tournament I looked at all the data and locked in the deck and just wanted to tune it. At that point me and other Winnipeg locals played a ton over the week, making sideboard guides and a plan for every matchup. It was tiring, and I would say it was 90% theory and 10% testing, but it was worth it in the end."</p>

<p>I'd say so. Not only did Karani's team put four members into the Top 16—the Winnipeg <i>Magic</i> community will be well-represented in Philadelphia—but Karani himself turned in an undefeated Day 2 performance, a spectacular Top 8 run and a victory at the <a href="https://magic.gg/news/joseph-karani-claims-victory-at-f2f-tour-calgary" target="_blank">F2F Tour Championship that doubled as the West Canada Regional Championship.</a></p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Surrounded by friends, a very emotional Joseph Karani from Winnipeg Manitoba takes down the F2F Tour Championship in Calgary. He will be representing Canada at the MTG World Championships. Congratulations! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/F2FYYC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#F2FYYC</a> <a href="https://t.co/cB67B10P3B">pic.twitter.com/cB67B10P3B</a></p>&mdash; Face to Face Games (@FaceToFaceGames) <a href="https://twitter.com/FaceToFaceGames/status/1602140703701991424?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 12, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Karani—who burst onto the <i>Magic</i> scene in 2019 with a win at Grand Prix Indianapolis alongside teammates Mohamad Qadi and Kevin Brown and added a Top 8 at a Face To Face Open that year—can't wait to get back to the Pro Tour.</p>

<p>"I had taken a step back; online play didn't really interest me the same way playing in person does, so I was really excited when the Face 2 Face Tour was announce again and the Pro Tour came back. I thought it was time to saddle it up again and see if I could run it back and maybe play on the Pro Tour again.</p>

<p>"Then this happened. Looking at 2023, I'm going to every Pro Tour I can. Plus I have a World Championship invite, which is still unreal at this point to even think about. That was never on my goal radar; I don't know how to even process that yet."</p>

<p>Karani plans on putting a ton of work into <i>Magic</i> over the next year (plus a recent appearance on the <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/first-strike/id1179017028" target="_blank">First Strike podcast</a>) and he can't wait to keep going.</p>

<p>"It's going to be a lot more work, but I welcome it and I'm excited to do it again," he said. "I get to do it with a very strong Winnipeg community supporting me. I'm a very emotional guy, and I was crying and hugging my boys when I won. We have a very strong community of Winnipeggers—we aren't a big city and we have brutal winters so you may as well play some cardboard with your friends, you know?"</p>

<p>Don't worry, Joseph. Philadelphia gets plenty cold, too. We'll see you there.</p>

<h1>Looking Ahead</h1>

<p>I keep saying it, but it really is a booming period for high-level <i>Magic.</i> To wit, Eternal Weekend in North America just went off without a hitch and featured some of the most iconic <i>Magic</i> gameplay we can hope to see (and yes, a lot of taking the initiative as well), and it generated a <a href="https://twitter.com/anzidmtg/status/1602917609426792448" target="_blank">ton of great stories in itself</a>, plus some very worthy winners who took home <a href="https://twitter.com/rykerwilliams/status/1602682756751798272" target="_blank">some very cool prizes</a>!</p>

<p>Next up on the path the Pro Tour is the <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Tournament/View/12862" target="_blank">Mexico/Central America/Caribbean Regional Championship</a> taking place this weekend in Mexico City. With that, we'll be off into 2023 and turn our eyes to the Pro Tour that's just two short months away—February 17–19, 2023!</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Metagame Mentor: Standard and Modern with The Brothers' War</title><link>https://magic.gg/news/metagame-mentor-standard-and-modern-with-the-brothers-war</link><guid>https://magic.gg/news/metagame-mentor-standard-and-modern-with-the-brothers-war</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to Metagame Mentor, your weekly guide to the top decks and latest Constructed developments on the path to the Pro Tour. This week, I'm taking a brief break from coverage of the ongoing Pioneer Regional Championships. Instead, I'll look at the biggest innovations in Standard and Modern since the release of <i>The Brothers' War</i>.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/DJPNxAlrmrCNwY5ZB7Fc6/a1e2363f540575f16e5741b149b2280d/1080x1080-Magic-Premier-Play-Path-2022-2023-Infographic.jpg" /></div></div><br />

<p>Regional Championship Qualifiers (RCQs) in these formats are happening right now. Until December 19, 2022, RCQs will feed the second round of Regional Championships, which will be held in February, March, or April 2023 depending on your region. After a holiday break, RCQs from January 7, 2023 through April 3, 2023 will feed the third round of Regional Championships, which will be held in May, June, or July 2023. Don't miss your chance to qualify by finding tournaments on the <a href="https://locator.wizards.com/" target="_blank">Store &amp; Event Locator</a> or your <a href="https://magic.gg/pro-tour?section=regional-championships#pro-tour" target="_blank">regional organizer's website</a>.</p>

<h1>Standard with The Brothers' War</h1>

<p>To provide a metagame snapshot for <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/formats/standard" target="_blank">Standard</a>, I used all <a href="https://www.mtgo.com/en/mtgo/decklists" target="_blank"><i>Magic Online</i> decklists</a> from Standard Challenge, Standard Last Chance, and Standard Showcase Qualifier events held from November 21 through December 12. In addition, I included all decklists with net positive records from Standard tournaments on <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklists/Standard" target="_blank">MTG Melee</a> from the same time period, which captures the last three weeks of competition.</p>

<p>After correcting archetypes and assigning to each deck a number of points equal to its number of match wins minus its number of match losses, I derived the following record-weighted metagame breakdown. It may be interpreted as a winner's metagame that you can expect to see at the top tables. Archetype names hyperlink to a well-performing decklist closest to the aggregate of the archetype. Up and down arrows signify the biggest changes compared to <a href="https://magic.gg/news/metagame-mentor-november-2022-standard-pioneer-and-modern-updates" target="_blank">my metagame roundup from early November</a>, right before the release of <i>The Brothers' War</i>.</p>

<p>At 36.8% of the winner's metagame, Grixis Midrange continues its domination of Standard. The deck won the <a href="https://magic.gg/events/magic-world-championship-xxviii" target="_blank">World Championship</a> in the hands of Nathan Steuer, and it hasn't slowed down after the release of <i>The Brothers' War</i>. Grixis has the best threats, interaction, and card advantage across blue, black, and red, and there are various ways to build it. But no matter how you slice it, you can control the early game with <auto-card>Make Disappear</auto-card> and <auto-card>Bloodtithe Harvester</auto-card>, pull ahead on card advantage with <auto-card>Fable of the Mirror-Breaker</auto-card> and <auto-card>Corpse Appraiser</auto-card>, and close out the game with <auto-card>Invoke Despair</auto-card>.</p>

<p>Yet cards from the new set have led to substantial Standard metagame shifts. The top 10 most-played new cards from <i>The Brothers' War</i> across my 450-decklist data set have boosted existing Standard archetypes and delivered new ones:</p>

<ul>
	<li><b><auto-card>Go for the Throat</auto-card> (876 copies):</b> An efficient removal spell with a nearly negligible restriction as the downside. In many black midrange decks, it has replaced <auto-card>Infernal Grasp</auto-card>.</li>
	<li><b><auto-card>Brotherhood's End</auto-card> (514 copies):</b> A three-mana sweeper that is particularly potent against aggro decks. It's mostly a sideboard card, but various Rakdos Midrange decks have even included it in their main decks.</li>
	<li><b><auto-card>Mishra's Foundry</auto-card> (286 copies):</b> A creature land that fits into mana base that already has more than enough colored sources. <auto-card>Mishra's Foundry</auto-card> has made its way into nearly every mono-color deck.</li>
	<li><b><auto-card>Lay Down Arms</auto-card> (231 copies):</b> A removal spell that can take out opposing creatures at an extremely mana-efficient rate. It has led to the emergence of Mono-White Midrange, which has enough Plains for the card to shine.</li>
	<li><b><auto-card>Phyrexian Fleshgorger</auto-card> (205 copies):</b> A flexible creature that punishes <auto-card>Abrade</auto-card> and other removal spells. It has enhanced the creature curve of Mono-Black Aggro in particular.</li>
	<li><b><auto-card>Underground River</auto-card> (199 copies):</b> A pain land that improves the consistency at which you can cast your blue and black spells. It has enhanced the mana base of Esper Midrange, Grixis Sacrifice, and so on.</li>
	<li><b><auto-card>Steel Seraph</auto-card> (174 copies):</b> A flexible creature that not only provides an immediate combat effect but also dodges <auto-card>Go for the Throat</auto-card>, <auto-card>Cut Down</auto-card>, and <auto-card>Destroy Evil</auto-card>. It has found a home in Mono-White Midrange and Mardu Midrange.</li>
	<li><b><auto-card>Loran of the Third Path</auto-card> (170 copies):</b> A way to add to the battlefield while destroying <auto-card>Reckoner Bankbuster</auto-card>, <auto-card>Oni-Cult Anvil</auto-card>, or <auto-card>Wedding Announcement</auto-card>. It's mostly a sideboard card, but various Esper Legends decks have even included it in their main decks.</li>
	<li><b><auto-card>Gix, Yawgmoth Praetor</auto-card> (146 copies):</b> A powerful creature that makes cheap, difficult-to-block creatures more curious. Gix synergizes well with <auto-card>Evolved Sleeper</auto-card>, <auto-card>Misery's Shadow</auto-card>, and <auto-card>Phyrexian Fleshgorger</auto-card>, and it has given mono-black decks a more aggressive orientation.</li>
	<li><b><auto-card>Monastery Swiftspear</auto-card> (116 copies):</b> A Pioneer and Modern staple that has now also found its way into Standard. It has revitalized Mono-Red Aggro.</li>
</ul>

<p>So these are the top new cards, but what do the new decks look like? If you last played Standard right before <i>The Brothers' War</i>, then the following five decklists should get you back up to speed.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Mono-White_Midrange____14f4cf76-416e-43fb-ae29-3fb577a90034===

<p>Mono-White Midrange, at 12.5% of the record-weighted metagame, is now the top non-black midrange deck in Standard. <auto-card>Wedding Announcement</auto-card> and <auto-card>The Wandering Emperor</auto-card> are two of the most powerful cards in Standard, and the mono-color mana base allows you to exploit <auto-card>Lay Down Arms</auto-card> and <auto-card>Mishra's Foundry</auto-card> from <i>The Brothers' War</i>. The creature base, featuring <auto-card>Ambitious Farmhand</auto-card> and <auto-card>Spirited Companion</auto-card> in the two-drop slot, embarrasses opposing <auto-card>Cut Down</auto-card> or <auto-card>Invoke Despair</auto-card>, as you have no juicy <auto-card>Cut Down</auto-card> targets and you have enough sacrifice fodder for <auto-card>Invoke Despair</auto-card>.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Mono-Red_Aggro____eacaf448-9531-4076-a70f-a36d281e5c81===

<p>Mono-Red Aggro, at 6.4% of the winner's metagame, has surged after <i>The Brothers' War</i> added <auto-card>Monastery Swiftspear</auto-card>; <auto-card>Feldon, Ronom Excavator</auto-card>; and <auto-card>Mechanized Warfare</auto-card>. <auto-card>Obliterating Bolt</auto-card> for the sideboard didn't hurt either, and <auto-card>Mishra's Foundry</auto-card> is your payoff for staying mono-color. While Mono-Red Aggro is mostly about haste creatures and burn spells, the prowess mechanic is important as well. To reliably trigger <auto-card>Monastery Swiftspear</auto-card>, there's a playset of <auto-card>Reckless Impulse</auto-card>. <auto-card>Jaya, Fiery Negotiator</auto-card> has finally found a home as well.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Mardu_Midrange____c91e79b3-c6ba-430e-8492-ae765c2c4048===

<p>Mardu Midrange, at 5.5% of the record-weighted metagame, is a relatively new development. It exploits several new cards from <i>The Brothers' War</i> (<auto-card>Steel Seraph</auto-card>, <auto-card>Go for the Throat</auto-card>, and <auto-card>Battlefield Forge</auto-card>) but its main draw is <auto-card>Archangel of Wrath</auto-card>. The Archangel's enters-the-battlefield ability lines up extremely well against <auto-card>Bloodtithe Harvester</auto-card> and <auto-card>Fable of the Mirror-Breaker</auto-card> from Grixis Midrange. And even though Mardu doesn't have a tri-land, the color combination does provide appealing access to both <auto-card>Wedding Announcement</auto-card> and <auto-card>Fable of the Mirror-Breaker</auto-card>. Although there are versions that go deeper into black with <auto-card>Bloodtithe Harvester</auto-card> and the like, the more controlling version shown above merely splashes black for a bit of removal.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Azorius_Soldiers____92d8ab87-8833-416b-8a6a-32700623ba92===

<p><auto-card>Valiant Veteran</auto-card> was around before, but it was waiting for <i>The Brothers' War</i>. Now, there are enough powerful Soldiers to fill an entire competitive Standard deck. You can put a lot of pressure on your opponent with <auto-card>Recruitment Officer</auto-card> or <auto-card>Yotian Frontliner</auto-card> on turn one; <auto-card>Harbin, Vanguard Aviator</auto-card> on turn two; and <auto-card>Skystrike Officer</auto-card> or <auto-card>Siege Veteran</auto-card> on turn three. And with <auto-card>Fortified Beachhead</auto-card>, you have so many colored white and blue sources the inclusion of several <auto-card>Mishra's Foundry</auto-card> is even possible. Finally, since this is all-creature deck with token generators, <auto-card>In the Trenches</auto-card> is perfect for overwhelming your opponents.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Grixis_Sacrifice____e7222431-7633-4ec1-93a2-58453a275883===

<p><auto-card>Oni-Cult Anvil</auto-card> has been supercharged by two new blue cards from <i>The Brothers' War</i>: <auto-card>Third Path Iconoclast</auto-card> and <auto-card>Saheeli, Filigree Master</auto-card>. Their steady stream of artifact tokens fuels <auto-card>Oni-Cult Anvil</auto-card> and keeps the sacrifice synergies going. In addition, <auto-card>Mishra's Research Desk</auto-card> is like a better version of <auto-card>Experimental Synthesizer</auto-card>, as it digs deeper, gives you an additional turn to play the exiled card, and triggers <auto-card>Oni-Cult Anvil</auto-card> twice. Grixis Sacrifice is one of the many new Standard archetypes enabled by the latest expansion set.</p>

<h1>Modern with The Brothers' War</h1>

<p>To provide a metagame snapshot for <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/formats/modern" target="_blank">Modern</a>, I used all <a href="https://www.mtgo.com/en/mtgo/decklists" target="_blank"><i>Magic Online</i> decklists</a> from Modern Preliminary, Modern Challenge, Modern Last Chance, and Modern Showcase Qualifier events held from November 21 through December 12. I added all decklists with net positive records from Modern tournaments on <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklists/Modern" target="_blank">MTG Melee</a> from the same time period, plus all Top 8 decklists from the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mtgtournamentsbawu/posts/pfbid02tpk7TqEsG376AwUhwUmi1pfMgrqRmVaEmuuTKqmEU3htkmcFdkiz5z1wNJAVd64Fl" target="_blank">RCQ at Spielepyramide Karlsruhe</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/apex.gaming.esports/posts/pfbid0PcTc6sBTxvB5Y5WyKJrqNnBzmcDcmWigdUANttyFijy13BQSDzf44rrdeXutbyPrl" target="_blank">RCQ at Apex Gaming</a>, and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/4seasonsBologna/posts/pfbid09hwgxdk3dikRpV6U6qRvsnQVZBG493W6vbEQYrZMWtvY55VE8XvuT8pCw81B6tBXl" target="_blank">4Seasons Tournament</a>.</p>

<p>After correcting archetypes and assigning to each deck a number of points equal to its number of match wins minus its number of match losses, I derived the following record-weighted metagame breakdown. It may be interpreted as a winner's metagame that you can expect to see at the top tables. Archetype names hyperlink to a well-performing decklist closest to the aggregate of the archetype. Up and down arrows to signify the biggest changes compared to <a href="https://magic.gg/news/metagame-mentor-november-2022-standard-pioneer-and-modern-updates" target="_blank">my metagame roundup from early November</a>, right before the release of <i>The Brothers' War</i>.</p>

<p>With <auto-card>Yorion, Sky Nomad</auto-card> banned, Izzet Murktide, Hammer Time, and Rakdos Undying have emerged as the top-tier decks to beat. Meanwhile, Four/Five-Color Creativity has taken an enormous plunge, as opponents have gotten ready with <auto-card>Blood Moon</auto-card> or <auto-card>Orvar, the All-Form</auto-card>. Also, a new Jund Reanimator archetype has provided an alternative way to exploit <auto-card>Archon of Cruelty</auto-card>.</p>

<p>Indeed, the top 10 most-played new cards from <i>The Brothers' War</i> across my 944-decklist data set had a noticeable impact on the Modern format:</p>

<ul>
	<li><b><auto-card>Brotherhood's End</auto-card> (161 copies):</b> A reliable sweeper against aggro decks and artifact decks that excels against Hammer Time, where both modes are relevant. It's almost solely a sideboard card, most commonly seen in Izzet Murktide lists.</li>
	<li><b><auto-card>Haywire Mite</auto-card> (135 copies):</b> An efficient answer to troublesome permanents like <auto-card>Urza's Saga</auto-card> or <auto-card>Leyline Binding</auto-card>. As it serves as a tutor target, it's found a home in the main deck of <auto-card>Urza's Saga</auto-card> decks like <auto-card>Hardened Scales</auto-card> and Hammer Time. (The white-blue Hammer Time variant remains most prominent, but white-green is on the rise.) <auto-card>Haywire Mite</auto-card> is also seen in the sideboard of <auto-card>Chord of Calling</auto-card> decks like Yawgmoth and in the sideboard of <auto-card>Karn, the Great Creator</auto-card> decks like Mono-Green Tron. It has even empowered a brand new Insects archetype!</li>
	<li><b><auto-card>Bitter Reunion</auto-card> (113 copies):</b> An enabler for the card <auto-card>Persist</auto-card> that can immediately grant haste to <auto-card>Archon of Cruelty</auto-card> or <auto-card>Primeval Titan</auto-card>. It has found a home in several <auto-card>Indomitable Creativity</auto-card> decks and has fueled the new Jund Reanimator archetype.</li>
	<li><b><auto-card>The Stone Brain</auto-card> (81 copies):</b> A solid answer to single-card combos like <auto-card>Indomitable Creativity</auto-card>, <auto-card>Living End</auto-card>, or <auto-card>Scapeshift</auto-card>. As an artifact, <auto-card>The Stone Brain</auto-card> a big deal for all Tron decks with <auto-card>Karn, the Great Creator</auto-card>. Likewise, it's a great sideboard tool for decks with metalcraft or artifact synergies, such as Hammer Time and <auto-card>Hardened Scales</auto-card>.</li>
	<li><b><auto-card>Third Path Iconoclast</auto-card> (66 copies):</b> A massive improvement on <auto-card>Young Pyromancer</auto-card> because it synergizes with <auto-card>Mishra's Bauble</auto-card> and creates artifacts. <auto-card>Third Path Iconoclast</auto-card> has been doing a lot of work in Izzet Prowess, which has had a resurgence. It can also act as an alternative win condition in Jeskai Breach: A few decks have cut <auto-card>Thassa's Oracle</auto-card>, unlocked <auto-card>Jegantha, the Wellspring</auto-card> as a companion, and aim to win the game by sacrificing enough Soldier tokens to <auto-card>Grinding Station</auto-card> to mill out the opponent.</li>
	<li><b><auto-card>Mishra's Research Desk</auto-card> (34 copies):</b> A new value card that acts as a tutor target for <auto-card>Urza's Saga</auto-card>. The most prominent <auto-card>Urza's Saga</auto-card> decks where it has found a home are Jeskai Breach and newcomer Steelseeker Food.</li>
	<li><b><auto-card>Sarinth Steelseeker</auto-card> (30 copies):</b> A way to generate a lot of velocity for artifact-laden decks with graveyard synergies. It has spawned an entirely new archetype in Steelseeker Food.</li>
	<li><b><auto-card>Scrapwork Mutt</auto-card> (29 copies):</b> An enabler and a payoff for <auto-card>Sarinth Steelseeker</auto-card>. <auto-card>Scrapwork Mutt</auto-card> is almost solely seen in this new archetype.</li>
	<li><b><auto-card>Forging the Anchor</auto-card> (23 copies):</b> A sorcery that can potentially draw five cards for three mana. <auto-card>Forging the Anchor</auto-card> has revitalized Affinity.</li>
	<li><b><auto-card>Arcane Proxy</auto-card> (20 copes): </b>A way to cast suspend cards like <auto-card>Crashing Footfalls</auto-card> from the graveyard. <auto-card>Arcane Proxy</auto-card> has been included in various Rhinos decks.</li>
</ul>

<p>So these are the top new cards, but what do the new decks look like? If you last played Modern right before <i>The Brothers' War</i>, then the following five decklists should get you back up to speed.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Izzet_Prowess____85f606a8-5f09-4a8b-971e-4c29033a826c===

<p>Izzet Prowess, at 2.8% of the record-weighted metagame, has surged ahead since the release of <i>The Brothers' War</i>. The archetype takes advantage of the prowess mechanic on its creatures by playing a burst of cheap card draw spells and flashback spells. With a pair of <auto-card>Monastery Swiftspear</auto-card>s followed by a flurry of <auto-card>Mutagenic Growth</auto-card>s and <auto-card>Lava Dart</auto-card>s, a turn three kill is easily possible. Newcomer <auto-card>Third Path Iconoclast</auto-card> allows you to overrun your opponents with an army of tokens, and it's superior to <auto-card>Sprite Dragon</auto-card> when interactive grindy midrange decks form a large part of the metagame and raw explosiveness is not as essential.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Jund_Reanimator____40f314b5-746d-456b-8df6-ca394acf9d71===

<p>Jund Reanimator, at 2.1% of the winner's metagame, can lead with Thoughseize on turn one, discards <auto-card>Archon of Cruelty</auto-card> to <auto-card>Bitter Reunion</auto-card> on turn two, and casts a game-ending <auto-card>Persist</auto-card> on turn three. <auto-card>Bitter Reunion</auto-card> gives <auto-card>Archon of Cruelty</auto-card> haste, which means that you get two triggers right away. Another new card from <i>The Brothers' War</i>, <auto-card>Mishra's Command</auto-card>, offers an alternative way of getting <auto-card>Archon of Cruelty</auto-card> into your graveyard on turn two.</p>

<p>A few versions run <auto-card>Primeval Titan</auto-card> for redundancy, but it's more common to fit the reanimation angle in an <auto-card>Indomitable Creativity</auto-card> shell. As a Jund deck, it's more resilient against <auto-card>Blood Moon</auto-card> than the five-color builds with <auto-card>Leyline Binding</auto-card>. Perhaps this is only a temporary benefit, as I'm already seeing the trend of Izzet Murktide players moving away from <auto-card>Blood Moon</auto-card> and back towards <auto-card>Archmage's Charm</auto-card>, but Jund Reanimator has emerged as a major contender over the past few weeks.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Steelseeker_Food____e3d892e1-51c5-4b4e-8ec3-c20d57ba13b6===

<p>Steelseeker Food, at 1.2% of the record-weighted metagame, is AspiringSpike's latest innovation. The appetizing strategy revolves around the existing <auto-card>The Underworld Cookbook</auto-card> + <auto-card>Ovalchase Daredevil</auto-card> engine, which creates a pile of Food tokens. With those tokens, you can activate <auto-card>Asmoranomardicadaistinaculdacar</auto-card> or return <auto-card>Feasting Troll King</auto-card> from the graveyard. This engine got supercharged by <auto-card>Sarinth Steelseeker</auto-card> and <auto-card>Scrapwork Mutt</auto-card> from <i>The Brothers' War</i>.</p>

<p><auto-card>Sarinth Steelseeker</auto-card> is easily triggered by Underworld Cookbook, and it generates a relevant advantage if the top of your library provides a free land or an <auto-card>Ovalchase Daredevil</auto-card>, <auto-card>Feasting Troll King</auto-card>, or <auto-card>Scrapwork Mutt</auto-card> to send to the graveyard. <auto-card>Scrapwork Mutt</auto-card>, in turn, is a discard outlet for <auto-card>Asmoranomardicadaistinaculdacar</auto-card>, helps put <auto-card>Ovalchase Daredevil</auto-card> or <auto-card>Feasting Troll King</auto-card> into the graveyard, and synergizes with <auto-card>Sarinth Steelseeker</auto-card>. Besides these two main new tools, <i>The Brother's War</i> also offered <auto-card>Urza's Saga</auto-card> updates in the form of <auto-card>Mishra's Research Desk</auto-card> and <auto-card>Haywire Mite</auto-card>. I'm excited to see such a sweet new archetype put up numbers!</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Affinity____d585a0a1-6dc4-4701-bbda-743d3c13c9ec===

<p>Affinity has returned to the spotlight after <i>The Brothers' War</i> added <auto-card>Forging the Anchor</auto-card>. In the deck shown above, which is filled to the brim with artifacts, you will draw 3.6 cards on average, which is a pretty good deal for three mana. It means that you won't run out of gas and will control enough artifacts to cast <auto-card>Sojourner's Companion</auto-card> for free. I'm not sure if such a three-mana card draw spell is really what the archetype needed to succeed, but it's a fascinating addition nonetheless.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Insects____37450a4a-7d22-4a6c-9c0e-e1026aba9376===

<p>When I first looked at <auto-card>Haywire Mite</auto-card>, I quickly glanced over its creature type. "Insect, irrelevant," I thought. But as shown by CrusherBotBG on <i>Magic Online</i>, the creature type actually matters a lot. With <auto-card>Blex, Vexing Pest</auto-card> and <auto-card>Swarmyard</auto-card> as existing payoffs, <auto-card>Haywire Mite</auto-card> was the missing one-drop to elevate Insects to competitive viability. Decks like these show that Modern remains a brewer's paradise filled with possibilities.</p>

<h1>Looking Ahead</h1>

<p>Next week, I'll return to Pioneer. I'm looking forward to analyzing last weekend's Regional Championship for <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Tournament/View/11822" target="_blank">West Canada</a> and this weekend's Regional Championship for <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Tournament/View/12862" target="_blank">Mexico/Central America/Caribbean</a>.

<h1>The Metagame and Win Rates</h1>

<p>Based on all decklists from the four Regional Championships held last weekend, I determined the combined metagame share of every archetype. I also calculated their non-mirror, non-bye, non-draw match win rates. I used my own algorithms and definitions to assign archetype labels, thereby sidestepping any potential mislabeling on MTG Melee. Let's take a look!</p>

<p>The most-played new-to-Pioneer cards from <i>The Brothers' War</i> were <auto-card>Misery's Shadow</auto-card>, <auto-card>Recruitment Officer</auto-card>, <auto-card>Brotherhood's End</auto-card>, <auto-card>Brushland</auto-card>, <auto-card>The Stone Brain</auto-card>, <auto-card>Obliterating Bolt</auto-card>, <auto-card>Cityscape Leveler</auto-card>, and <auto-card>Haywire Mite</auto-card>. These are the same top eight new cards as last week, albeit in a different order.</p>

  Fable of the Mirror-Breaker
</magic-cards>

<p>Compared to the first Regional Championship weekend, the Pioneer metagame has shifted again. In terms of popularity, Mono-Green Devotion took a massive plunge, whereas Rakdos Midrange and Lotus Field combo surged ahead. In terms of win rates, Izzet Phoenix performed much, much worse than in the first weekend. Izzet Phoenix's poor performance was caused by the uptick in Lotus Field combo, which is a terrible matchup, and by the adoption of anti-graveyard cards in various main decks.</p>

<p>The big winners, in terms of both popularity and win rates, were Rakdos Midrange and Mono-White Humans. Rakdos Midrange came out ahead by tweaking its flex slots for the expected metagame, while Mono-White Humans preyed on the thrive of Lotus Field combo.</p>

<p>To give an indication of significance based on the sample size: the 95% confidence interval for Rakdos Midrange's win rate ranged from 49.8% to 56.1%. For Mono-White Humans, the data gives 95% confidence that its true win rate lies between 51.3% and 60.7%. (For the mathematically inclined: I used the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_proportion_confidence_interval#Clopper%E2%80%93Pearson_interval" target="_blank">Clopper-Person interval</a>.)</p>

<p>I expect that Mono-White Humans has one or two more good weekends ahead until the metagame adapts by increasing sweepers counts in sideboards. That would be a natural metagame development in what I consider to be a healthy, dynamic environment. In a similar vein, last weekend also saw the return of <auto-card>Damping Sphere</auto-card> in the sideboard of many Mono-Green Devotion lists as a way to combat the rise of Lotus Field combo. Although Pioneer features many powerful cards and engines, there are tools to beat everything, and the right configuration differs from weekend to weekend.</p>

<p>At the moment, Rakdos Midrange gained a target on its back. Indeed, the finals in both Australia and Japan featured a Rakdos Midrange mirror!</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/2SnyMgrgPwamX4djUxtGNt/813515710df5d1c9d9c364099fd1e8bd/Antony-Lee-Rakdos-Midrange.jpg" /></div></div><br />

<p>Anthony Lee won his finals against David Mines with a big brain play employing his knowledge of the rules. When both players control <auto-card>Sheoldred, the Apocalypse</auto-card>, the triggers go on the stack in APNAP (Active Player, Non-Active Player) order, which means that the trigger from the non-active player resolves first. So with David Mines at 4 life, Anthony Lee used <auto-card>Bonecrusher Giant</auto-card> // Stomp to put him down to 2 life, then passed the turn. Two Sheoldred triggers went on the stack in David Mines' draw step, and he briefly fell to 0 life, losing the game with his own life gain trigger still on the stack.</p>

<p>While such interaction knowledge is useful, the last few slots in your main deck can be an even bigger driver of success. For example, the widespread adoption of <auto-card>Misery's Shadow</auto-card> has made the Mono-Green Devotion matchup closer to even. And to reinforce my earlier point about Izzet Phoenix's poor performance: Both Rakdos Midrange champions had anti-graveyard cards in their main decks as a countermeasure—Anthony Lee had <auto-card>Unlicensed Hearse</auto-card>; Rei Hirayama had <auto-card>Go Blank</auto-card>.</p>

<p>The Top 8 of the Regional Championship for Japan/Korea also showed various interesting choices. For example, <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/259886" target="_blank">Shota Yasooka</a> stuck with <auto-card>Liliana of the Veil</auto-card>, which could be a great call if Selesnya Auras keeps rising in popularity. Meanwhile, <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/259369" target="_blank">Ryuji Murae</a> had <auto-card>Hazoret the Fervent</auto-card> and <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/254653" target="_blank">Masamasa Kyogoku</a> had <auto-card>Glorybringer</auto-card>, both of which are excellent in the mirror match. If Rakdos Midrange remains widely popular, then the cards that excel in the mirror match would be the best positioned, although that might provide a more hospitable environment for Izzet Phoenix.</p>

<p>Regardless of the direction, one thing is certain: The metagame will march ever onwards. Rakdos Midrange, like any archetype in Pioneer, is beatable. If it remains on top, then I'd expect players to flock towards <auto-card>Fires of Invention</auto-card>; <auto-card>Skysovereign, Consul Flagship</auto-card>; or other cards that line up well against Rakdos Midrange.</p>

<h1>Spice Corner</h1>

<p>Although the top tables at Pioneer tournaments will largely be populated by Rakdos Midrange, Mono-Green Devotion, Izzet Phoenix, Mono-White Humans, Azorius Control, and Abzan Greasefang, there are many other important metagame developments and brews to keep in mind. From among players who posted excellent records last weekend, most of which were good enough for a Pro Tour invite, several decks stand out as spicy choices.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/spiVOHFZerRMVMy2XOcgr/8cf8282e39bb71fef1e1946a8fd4d420/Chris-Cousens-Mono-Green-Aggro.jpg" /></div></div><br />

<p>Chris Cousens finished 12th at the Regional Championship in Sydney, Australia, good for a Pro Tour invite. Although his list features <auto-card>Llanowar Elves</auto-card>, <auto-card>Old-Growth Troll</auto-card>, and <auto-card>Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx</auto-card>, this is not your typical Mono-Green Devotion deck. Indeed, this is <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/260721" target="_blank">Mono-Green Aggro</a>.</p>

<p>Rather than ramping into <auto-card>Cavalier of Thorns</auto-card> and <auto-card>Storm the Festival</auto-card> and setting up convoluted <auto-card>Karn, the Great Creator</auto-card> loops, Cousens goes for the throat. <auto-card>Steel Leaf Champion</auto-card> provides a fast clock; <auto-card>Vivien, Arkbow Ranger</auto-card> is a more aggressive version of Karn; and <auto-card>Aspect of Hydra</auto-card> is a devotion payoff that can one-shot opponents. Meanwhile, Nykthos is still useful, for example to build a gigantic <auto-card>Lair of the Hydra</auto-card> or to cast <auto-card>Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger</auto-card>, which Vivien can grab from the sideboard.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/6qltOCSXVnhKFGTCyKOjKy/9edf4442b5161a97271cf47383ad3eab/Dmitry-Medvedev-Selesnya-Angels.jpg" /></div></div><br />

<p>Both Dmitry Medvedev and Alexey Shashov made the Top 8 of their Regional Championship in Singapore with the same 74-card <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/260529" target="_blank">Selesnya Angels</a> list. (Shashov had one <auto-card>Guardian of Faith</auto-card> in his sideboard instead of the second <auto-card>Brutal Cathar</auto-card>.)</p>

<p>Selesnya Angels has been on the rise ever since <i>The Brothers' War</i> added <auto-card>Brushland</auto-card> and <auto-card>Kayla's Reconstruction</auto-card> to the Pioneer format, and this continued in the second weekend of Regional Championships. Medvedev and Shashov also made several small tweaks. First, they added two additional <auto-card>Collected Company</auto-card> hits: <auto-card>Tomik, Distinguished Advokist</auto-card> is a two-drop that nullifies the power of <auto-card>Kiora, Behemoth Beckoner</auto-card>, while <auto-card>Lunarch Veteran</auto-card> is a one-drop that synergizes with <auto-card>Righteous Valkyrie</auto-card>. Their singleton <auto-card>Brave the Elements</auto-card> is also a clever choice in an open decklist format. Finally, <auto-card>Deafening Silence</auto-card> and <auto-card>Silence</auto-card> in the sideboard help fight back against Lotus Field combo. All in all, Selesnya Angels is establishing itself as a real contender in the Pioneer metagame, and these tweaks shore up some of the deck's weaknesses.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/5G6IyPE6CPfiHDIV4FQ1Ed/68abf7ea8266a193172d9d9ffd5c51d4/Kazuhiro-Kamata-Rakdos-Sacrifice.jpg" /></div></div><br />

<p>Kazuhiro Kamata earned a Pro Tour invitation with his 15th-place finish at the Regional Championship in Aichi, Japan. He chose to play <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/259901" target="_blank">Rakdos Sacrifice</a> with a tiny green splash because he believed he had a good matchup against Rakdos Midrange and Green Devotion. The matchup against Izzet Phoenix might be rough, but that shouldn't be a problem if that archetype is on the downturn.</p>

<p>Kamata's list features a sweet combo: two main deck copies of <auto-card>Kari Zev's Expertise</auto-card> along with two copies of <auto-card>Diabolic Intent</auto-card>. Just imagine stealing <auto-card>Old-Growth Troll</auto-card> and sacrificing it to search for a missing piece of the <auto-card>Witch's Oven</auto-card> + <auto-card>Cauldron Familiar</auto-card> + <auto-card>Mayhem Devil</auto-card> engine. That's pretty powerful indeed. He also has a singleton <auto-card>Korvold, Fae-Cursed King</auto-card> as a tutor target, which he can cast via Treasures or two green dual lands. Kamata felt that <auto-card>Kari Zev's Expertise</auto-card> was more powerful than access to <auto-card>Jegantha, the Wellspring</auto-card>, and he even managed to steal his opponent's <auto-card>Skysovereign, Consul Flagship</auto-card> one game.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/5WYRqRD2XwzYMGFkz0FiS7/6171e8f0d170abdae4864198d6156870/Kazuya-Kiyofuji-Azorius-Control.jpg" /></div></div><br />

<p>Kazuya Kiyofuji made the Top 8 at the Regional Championship in Aichi, Japan with a variation on Azorius Control that I would describe as <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/259887" target="_blank">Azorius Lotus Field</a>. With <auto-card>Strict Proctor</auto-card> and <auto-card>Discontinuity</auto-card>, you can annul the enters-the-battlefield tax, which means that you won't have to sacrifice two lands to <auto-card>Lotus Field</auto-card>. This allows you to ramp into <auto-card>Teferi, Hero of Dominaria</auto-card> or <auto-card>Shark Typhoon</auto-card> ahead of time.</p>

<p>His list also features a new addition from <i>The Brothers' War</i> in the form of <auto-card>Soul Partition</auto-card>. It may be only temporary removal, but that's all you need when your late game is superior. Also, if you exile <auto-card>Cavalier of Thorns</auto-card> while controlling <auto-card>Strict Proctor</auto-card>, your opponent suddenly needs nine total mana if they want to benefit from Cavalier's enters-the-battlefield trigger.</p>

<p>Hidenari Ikeda earned a Pro Tour invitation with his 15th-place finish at the Regional Championship in Aichi, Japan. While Azorius Control and Dimir Control have been the more typical choices for control decks in Pioneer, he proved the viability of <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/258576" target="_blank">Esper Control</a>. The third color comes at the cost of more tapped lands, but the mana base is good enough overall.</p>

<p>Running all three colors provides clear benefits. Blue is of course a necessity for control players, as it offers countermagic and card draw. Black offers the most efficient spot removal in <auto-card>Fatal Push</auto-card> and the best sweeper in <auto-card>Extinction Event</auto-card>, which is superior to <auto-card>Supreme Verdict</auto-card> in the present metagame because it exiles <auto-card>Old-Growth Troll</auto-card> and <auto-card>Cavalier of Thorns</auto-card>. White offers the best win conditions in <auto-card>The Wandering Emperor</auto-card> and <auto-card>Teferi, Hero of Dominaria</auto-card>. With Esper Control, you have it all.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/2T8YmrNKhOoe1spbtFbP48/5a6c2562a4dc8af22c6532718255002f/Liam-Hoban-Dimir-Oracle.jpg" /></div></div><br />

<p>Although Liam Hoban's 10-4 record may not have been enough for a Pro Tour invite, he made a deep run with a spicy new <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/260915" target="_blank">Dimir Oracle</a> brew, potentially inspired by the deck that won the <a href="https://www.mtgo.com/en/mtgo/decklist/pioneer-challenge-2022-11-1912495570" target="_blank">November 19 Pioneer Challenge</a>.</p>

<p>Fueled by <auto-card>Fallaji Archaeologist</auto-card> from <i>The Brothers' War</i>, the game plan is to mill or exile your entire library as quickly as possible and then win by casting <auto-card>Thassa's Oracle</auto-card>. Once you start to chain <auto-card>Demonic Bargain</auto-card>s, your library will disappear rapidly, although the process is still more convoluted than in the days of <auto-card>Inverter of Truth</auto-card>. Deck development like these prove that Pioneer remains underexplored, with plenty of wild options ready to be discovered.</p>

But no matter where you're from, you'll have your regional champions to cheer for.</p>

<p>Although <i>Magic</i> World Championship XXIX is still almost a full year away, the excitement is already building up for the competitors. As Anthony Lee said after winning his Regional Championship: "I'm really excited. I've gotten to be on some Worlds testing teams the last few years, helping out [2018 World Champion] Javier Dominguez, who was invaluable by the way in helping me get here of course. And it's gonna be really exciting to be able to be the one competing. Right now I know Nathan Steuer and Sam Rolph are already qualified. We teamed with them for the [New Capenna Championship] so I know they're way better than me, but I hope that with Javier's help, we can bridge the gap."</p>

<p>High-level tabletop <i>Magic</i> is back. The passion and fire for in-person <i>Magic</i> tournaments shone through at the Regional Championships last weekend, and many players paved their paths to the Pro Tour. Moreover, with every subsequent event, the field for next year's World Championship is starting to firm up with more great talent.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>F2F Tour Championship: Calgary Final Standings</title><link>https://magic.gg/news/f2f-tour-championship-calgary-final-standings</link><guid>https://magic.gg/news/f2f-tour-championship-calgary-final-standings</guid><description><![CDATA[<data-table os="Windows" data-id="5tvubm7cMGRyJhnwC5Dg56"></data-table>]]></description></item><item><title>The Week That Was: Making It To The Big Stage</title><link>https://magic.gg/news/the-week-that-was-making-it-to-the-big-stage</link><guid>https://magic.gg/news/the-week-that-was-making-it-to-the-big-stage</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>I want to start this week by peeling back the curtain a little bit. We're deep into the Regional Championship season across the world, and that means there's a lot that comes across my desk week-to-week (or <a href="https://twitter.com/Chosler" target="_blank">my Twitter</a>, anyway). There are more stories in <i>Magic</i> than we'll ever be able to cover, even with the return of The Week That Was.</p>

<p>But we're going to try anyway.</p>

<p>Across the world thousands of players are convening, for one of the first times in years, for high-level tabletop <i>Magic</i> everywhere you can find tables to sleeve up sixty. For me, that means a schedule of events and winners to follow, all the way up to and through 2023. By the time we reach <i>Magic</i> World Championship XXIX later next year, we'll have a large field of players, some of whom you may not have heard of.</p>

<p>But for those following the developments across the world (and the world of <i>Magic),</i> you'll begin to recognize names – even if they aren't always the winners. With so much happening, there's a <i>lot</i> of players fulfilling a dream who may not make it into the headlines – so today we're going to cover a handful of stories from across the globe.</p>

<h1>Two Regional Championships Crown Victors</h1>

<p>Let's start with a look at last week's events.</p>

<p>We had Regional Championships taking place in South America and Asia, with the <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Tournament/View/13040" target="_blank">South America <i>Magic</i> Series</a> taking place in Santiago and the <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Tournament/View/12465" target="_blank">MIT Championship</a>, respectively. They come on the heels of a month of high-level Pioneer Regional Championship play, and as the season has gone on the format has continued to evolve, a constantly shifting target for those competing in later weekends. A format that at the outset looked to be dominated by <auto-card>Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx</auto-card> and Mono-Green Devotion has instead revealed itself as an open format with some mainstays but altogether more possibilities than imagined before the season.</p>

<p>That played perfectly for Alejandro Sepúlveda, who surprised the field with Mono-Red Aggro and stormed his way through the field en route to a finals where he faced down another surprise deck: Dimir Control in the hands of Julian Prado. (Check out <a href="https://magic.gg/news/metagame-mentor-pioneer-at-the-south-america-and-chinese-taipei-regional-championships" target="_blank">Frank's column for more on the decks and the Pioneer metagame</a>!) It was the culmination of an event with more than 200 players from across the continent gathering to compete for a spot at the first Pro Tour of 2023 and the World Championship. The buzz to get back to the Pro Tour brought out the best in the region, and the Top 8 featured a number of accomplished competitors including <a href="https://www.magic.gg/news/a-champions-path-back-to-magic" target="_blank">former Mythic Champion Mattias Leveratto</a>. With the win, Sepúlveda secures both a Pro Tour invite as well as guaranteeing himself a seat at the World Championship, and he heads there with momentum.</p>

<p>Over in New Tapei City, 55 players competed until Jim Tim Lee found himself atop the field with his trusted Rakdos Midrange deck (Rakdos has been the most consistent performer in Pioneer, despite the lack of hype around the deck entering the season). Lee described his deck choice as a "if you can't beat 'em, join 'em," mentality, and it's hard to argue with the undefeated results that stratagem yielded him. But even with the ubiquitous Rakdos winning the event, it had to go through a surprise Esper Control brew in the finals to get there.</p>

<h1>Victories Large (And Small)</h1>

<p>My job here is to share the path to the Pro Tour. And I take that somewhat literally – the road to the Pro Tour doesn't begin in the finals of a big PTQ or on Friday of the tournament or in deck selection the week before, or testing houses and Discords and all the rest.</p>

<p>It begins, like many great things, at the table with friends.</p>

<p>Not everyone will qualify for the Regional Championship and find unburdened success in front of them. But what can sometimes get lost in a week-to-week, Top 8-to-Top 8 world is that by the time you read about a player doing well in a particular tournament, odds are they've been steadfastly grinding away for years to improve their game and level up their results. That's one of the reasons Brian David-Marshall (the mainstay author of The Week That Was in years past) gave me this piece of advice when I picked up the column: highlight players at every stage of their journey. If the first time I'm introducing you to a winner is when they're lifting the trophy, then I've probably missed something along the way.</p>

<p>That's why I love stories like this one, which are told over and over again on the way to the Pro Tour.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">My teammate <a href="https://twitter.com/BlitzMTG?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@BlitzMTG</a> and I played in the finals in the store were sponsored in and seeing how excited he was and how much work he had put into his deck to win was worth the loss tbh</p>&mdash; Austin Olet (@AustinOlet) <a href="https://twitter.com/AustinOlet/status/1599864492346683392?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 5, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Whether it's in the finals of the PT or the finals of FNM at Knight of Thorn in Watertown, New York, this is what the path to the Pro Tour looks like – it's a journey with different destinations for everyone, but we're all along for the same ride. I think back to my own competitive <i>Magic</i> accomplishments those matches where I was a game away from the Pro Tour for the first time. For me, the path to the Pro Tour was a gateway to what I really dreamed of doing: coverage. For friends meeting in the finals of the PTQ, that's what the path to the Pro Tour looks like. For Leveratto, it was a whirlwind of <i>Magic</i> after returning home from abroad in the last weekend of qualifiers. For Anthony Lee, it was years of dedicated assistance for teammates qualified for tournaments he wasn't – and they paid back the favor as he <a href="https://magic.gg/news/the-week-that-was-many-hands-make-qualifying-light-work" target="_blank">lived out those dreams himself at his Regional Championship</a>. Every weekend, Pro Tour dreams are being made and it's been a blast to follow.</p>

<p>As we sit near the midpoint of the Regional Championship schedule, it felt like a good time to step back and remember that while we're chasing spicy decks and trophy winners (and with good reason!), the stories don't stop with the Top 8, and the ranks of the Pro Tour and World Championship in 2023 – and truthfully the future of competitive <i>Magic</i> overall – are being filled in at X-3 brackets across the world.</p>

<h1>All Roads Lead to Philly</h1>

<p>All roads lead to <a href="https://magic30.mtgfestivals.com/en-us/home.html" target="_blank">MagicCon: Philadelphia</a>, where the hundreds of players from across the world proving right now that they belong with the best in the business will have their opportunity to take the next step at the Pro Tour. Philadelphia, of course, is famous for being <a href="https://magic.gg/news/the-week-that-was-miranda-masters-modern" target="_blank">home to the first Modern Pro Tour</a>, which was a major step forward for competitive <i>Magic</i> (not to mention one of the most entertaining <i>Magic</i> events I've ever watched), so it's fitting that it will be home to the return of the paper Pro Tour. That event will kickstart a yearlong run to the World Championship, and the field – which already includes <a href="https://magic.gg/news/the-week-that-was-the-greatest-steuer-ever-told" target="_blank">reigning World Champ Nathan Steuer</a> along with Eli Kassis, Karl Sarap, and Jakub Tóth (the rest of the Top 4 at <a href="https://magic.gg/events/magic-world-championship-xxviii" target="_blank"><i>Magic</i> World Championship XXVIII</a>. The list is growing all the time, with Jim Tim Lee and Alejandro Sepúlveda adding their names this week. <a href="https://magic.gg/news/metagame-mentor-pioneer-at-the-south-america-and-chinese-taipei-regional-championships" target="_blank">Frank has the most up-to-date list here</a>.</p>

<p>So what does all of that mean, here at the midway point of the RC season? From where I'm sitting, at least, the fire for the Pro Tour is back. Seeing teams of players regroup in person after months or years apart with meaningful tournaments to play in has been frankly really reinvigorating after years of online events.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Not an underdog story but watching <a href="https://twitter.com/misplacedginger?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@misplacedginger</a> put in a ton of effort in the RB deck streaming month after month.

<p>Navigating this season along with Frank, our field reporters and editorial staff has been the most plugged-in to a <i>Magic</i> season I've ever been, and between you and me that's saying something. The vibe I've gotten from most players has been similar, and the continued evolution of Pioneer has been a story in itself. In short, the blueprint is here, and personally I'm excited as hell for what 2023 has to bring for competitive <i>Magic.</i> And I'm not the only one – fun fact: shortly before I sat down to write this, I just got my clock cleaned by Jean-Emmanuel Depraz in <i>The Brothers' War</i> Sealed on <i>MTG Arena.</i> Seriously, is there <i>anywhere</i> that guy isn't at winning matches?</p>

<h1>Looking Ahead</h1>

<p>The holidays approach, and with a handful of Regional Championships left to play, we turn next to Canada, where the second championship of the season is on tap. The Eastern Canada Regional Championship got things rolling two weeks ago, with Christian Trudel <a href="https://www.magic.gg/news/christian-trudel-wins-big-at-torontos-f2f-tour" target="_blank">taking down the FacetoFace Tour Weekend</a> with Mono-Green Devotion.</p>

<p>There are more World Championship seats on the line when players get their shot this weekend at the <a href="https://f2ftour.com/event/f2f-tour-weekend-calgary-2022/" target="_blank">Championship</a> in Calgary, Alberta. Following that we move to the Mexico/Central America/Caribbean Regional Championship before closing out 2022.

<p>Alejandro Sepúlveda won the <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Tournament/View/13040" target="_blank">South America Regional Championship</a> with <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/262330" target="_blank">Mono-Red Aggro</a>.

<p>You can find the Top 8 bracket, photos, and more on the <a href="https://stage.magic.gg/events/south-america-magic-series-santiago" target="_blank">South American Regional Championship coverage page</a>.</p>

<p>Competition was fierce, with 203 players in attendance to vie for four total invitations to the Pro Tour. The region-dependent number of Pro Tour invites was determined by Wizards of the Coast in early 2022; the specific structure and number of Regional Championship Qualifiers is set by Magicsur Chile. It's great to see the passion of the South American <i>Magic</i> community as many players enthusiastically traveled to compete against the best players in their region.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/5Qxu0GCdlgb6WLOD8pToTm/3b05523745f51ff23f47ba9ded745c26/1920x1000-Alejandro-Sepulveda-MonoRed-Aggro.jpg" /></div></div><br />

<p>Mono-Red Aggro hadn't put up notable results in recent weeks. But with his victory, Alejandro Sepúlveda put it back on the map. "I have a lot of experience with the deck so I was locked on [Red Deck Wins]," he said when asked about his reasons for choosing the deck. "I think that experience can give me a greater edge than playing a better deck I don't know how to play."</p>

<p>Sepúlveda's list offers both board presence and burn. <auto-card>Hazoret the Fervent</auto-card> is excellent against Rakdos Midrange, as it's hard to answer and helps push through <auto-card>Sheoldred, the Apocalypse</auto-card>. The constant fear of <auto-card>Embercleave</auto-card> is also very real, yet Sepúlveda doesn't go all-in on the legendary equipment with cards like <auto-card>Burning-Tree Emissary</auto-card> and <auto-card>Anax, Hardened in the Forge</auto-card>. Rather, he retains a healthy dose of burn spells, supported by <auto-card>Eidolon of the Great Revel</auto-card> and <auto-card>Rampaging Ferocidon</auto-card> to put additional pressure on the opponent's life total.</p>

<p>"During testing I noticed that <auto-card>Rampaging Ferocidon</auto-card> lines up really well vs most of the meta," he said. "The dino dodges <auto-card>Fatal Push</auto-card>, <auto-card>Bloodtithe Harvester</auto-card>, and <auto-card>Bonecrusher Giant</auto-card> and forces your opponent to follow tricky lines where they stop attacking to leave up blockers that usually end up getting bolted."</p>

<p>His sideboard has some spice as well. As he explained, <auto-card>Leyline of Combustion</auto-card> is "your best card" against Rakdos Midrange and Izzet Phoenix. "They can't interact with it; see it as some sort of one-sided <auto-card>Eidolon of the Great Revel</auto-card>." Sepúlveda's experience with the deck allowed him to pick the right cards for the metagame, and it paid off!</p>

<p>You can find the Top 8 bracket, photos, and more on the <a href="https://stage.magic.gg/events/mit-championship-new-taipei-city" target="_blank">Chinese Taipei Regional Championship coverage page</a>. In total, 55 players were in attendance to vie for two Pro Tour slots.</p>

===decklistId:Rakdos_Midrange_Jim_Tim_Lee_MIT_Championship_12_3_2022_3fce2c3c-bb26-49d6-8a6f-a6b7a8c29f62===

<p>"If you can't beat them, join them!" Jim Tim Lee explained. Indeed, Rakdos Midrange had been the most popular deck archetype in <a href="https://www.magic.gg/news/metagame-mentor-the-quadruple-regional-championship-weekend" target="_blank">the preceding Regional Championships weekend</a>, and that trend continued globally.</p>

<p>His build, which went undefeated throughout the tournament, is a near-exact copy of Rei Hirayama's list that won the Japan/Korea Regional Championship. <auto-card>Go Blank</auto-card> in the main deck surely helped in beating Izzet Phoenix. The only difference was Jim Tim Lee's use of <auto-card>Canyon Slough</auto-card> instead of the second Swamp. This increases the likelihood of drawing a perfect mix of lands and spells.</p>

<h1>The Metagame and Win Rates</h1>

<p>Based on all decklists from both Regional Championships held last weekend, I determined the combined metagame share of every archetype. I also calculated their non-mirror, non-bye, non-draw match win rates. I used my own algorithms and definitions to assign archetype labels, thereby sidestepping any potential mislabeling on MTG Melee. Let's take a look!</p>

<p>In this table, each archetype name hyperlinks to a well-performing decklist close to the aggregate of that archetype. The "Other" category included such deck archetypes as <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/262263" target="_blank">Bant Humans</a>, <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/262301" target="_blank">Rakdos Creativity</a>, <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/262132" target="_blank">Mono-Red Wizards</a>, <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/262088" target="_blank">Mono-Blue Control</a>, <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/262229" target="_blank">Izzet Dragons</a>, <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/262385" target="_blank">Jund Sacrifice</a>, <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/262395" target="_blank">Orzhov Midrange</a>, <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/262308" target="_blank">Bard Class</a>, <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/262280" target="_blank">Elves</a>, <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/262396" target="_blank">Abzan Deathtouch</a>, and <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/262250" target="_blank">Selesnya Auras</a>.</p>

<p>The overall metagame was quite similar to <a href="https://www.magic.gg/news/metagame-mentor-the-quadruple-regional-championship-weekend" target="_blank">the one from the preceding weekend</a>. The most notable difference is an uptick in both Mono-White Humans and Azorius Control. While these decks look to be on an upward trend, sample sizes for the number of players and number of matches were relatively small. So it's hard to draw significant conclusions about either popularity or performance. Indeed, most of the winrates were not different from 50-50 in a statistically significant sense.</p>

<p>Except for Mono-Green Devotion, which fell flat despite being heavily played. One reason for this, based on comparing aggregate decklists from last weekend to the ones from the weekend before, is that many players are making small tweaks to improve their deck against Mono-Green Devotion. For example, many Rakdos Midrange players have added <auto-card>Pithing Needle</auto-card> to their sideboards to stop planeswalkers. Combined with pressure from <auto-card>Misery's Shadow</auto-card>, the right build of Rakdos Midrange may now actually be favored against Mono-Green Devotion.</p>

<p>Likewise, many Mono-White Humans players added main deck <auto-card>Tomik, Distinguished Advokist</auto-card> to stop <auto-card>Kiora, Behemoth Beckoner</auto-card>, and many Azorius Control players increased their <auto-card>Field of Ruin</auto-card> count to destroy <auto-card>Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx</auto-card>. Tomik, <auto-card>Field of Ruin</auto-card>, and <auto-card>Pithing Needle</auto-card> all answer <auto-card>Thespian's Stage</auto-card> as well, thereby providing splash damage against the <auto-card>Lotus Field</auto-card> combo decks. Even though <auto-card>Lotus Field</auto-card> combo <a href="https://twitter.com/CainRianhard/status/1599502466826895362/photo/2" target="_blank">won the Showcase Qualifier</a> on <i>Magic</i> Online, it didn't have a good weekend at the Regional Championships.</p>

<h1>Rise and Success of Anti-Rakdos Decks</h1>

<p>Rakdos Midrange remains the most popular archetype, but like any archetype in Pioneer, it's beatable. More and more players are flocking towards cards or strategies that line up well against Rakdos Midrange, and many found success last weekend.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/1pxASN4scrWeZBO8VIcF2o/468de469acacc8aac58f2f68fd4aafca/1920x1000-Julian-Prado-Dimir-Control.jpg" /></div></div><br />

<p>One of the biggest new developments to come out of the Regional Championship in Santiago de Chile was that two players with nearly the same <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/262277" target="_blank">Dimir Control</a> deck did exceedingly well. Andrés Camargo narrowly missed Top 8 at 6-2, while Julian Prado made the finals and earned a Pro Tour invite.</p>

<p>The unique element in their list is four copies of <auto-card>Day's Undoing</auto-card>. When you control <auto-card>Narset, Parter of Veils</auto-card> or <auto-card>Notion Thief</auto-card>, the symmetry is broken—you get a fresh hand of seven new cards while your opponent receives only one or zero cards. You can be the ultimate villain by first bouncing one of their creatures with <auto-card>Rona's Vortex</auto-card>, then forcing your opponent to draw a card via the alternate cost on <auto-card>Baleful Mastery</auto-card>, and finally casting <auto-card>Day's Undoing</auto-card>. This leaves them with nothing. Then, immediately after they draw a card in their draw step, you activate <auto-card>Geier Reach Sanitarium</auto-card>, effectively locking the opponent out of the game.</p>

<p>The two players on this version of Dimir Midrange went 5-0 against Rakdos Midrange in the Swiss, which is certainly promising. Their lists were extremely similar, with only a few small differences: Andrés Camargo had a third Island and an <auto-card>Urborg, Tomb of Yawgmoth</auto-card> instead of a second <auto-card>Fetid Pools</auto-card> and a second Swamp in the main deck, as well as <auto-card>Sheoldred, the Apocalypse</auto-card> instead of <auto-card>Kaervek, the Spiteful</auto-card> in the sideboard. I'm interested to see if this brew from South America will catch on globally.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/2nsqlX8xIrm5amaQjurX7D/7334635a2540ab0f1838666be480244d/1920x1000-Joaquin-Maletti-Enigmatic-Fires.jpg" /></div></div><br />

<p>Another major story to come out of the Regional Championship in Santiago de Chile was that there were two copies of <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/262462" target="_blank">Enigmatic Fires</a> in the Top 8. Luis Mesa lost the quarterfinals, whereas Joaquin Maletti made it to the semifinals. The archetype preys on Rakdos Midrange because effects like <auto-card>Back to Nature</auto-card> or <auto-card>Erase</auto-card> are not available in red or black, so Rakdos decks are traditionally weak to enchantments.</p>

<p>In Pioneer, <auto-card>Enigmatic Incarnation</auto-card> and <auto-card>Fires of Invention</auto-card> are some of the most powerful enchantments available, and they can overpower Rakdos Midrange opponents with ease. Whether it's fetching <auto-card>Titan of Industry</auto-card> on turn four or casting a free <auto-card>Kenrith, the Returned King</auto-card> with activation mana up, Enigmatic Fires will be well-positioned as long as Rakdos Midrange remains the most popular deck in Pioneer.</p>

<p>Joaquin Maletti's version features <auto-card>Oath of Chandra</auto-card> instead of <auto-card>Trial of Ambition</auto-card>. This is superior for mana base reasons, as black is basically a splash and it's easier to cast <auto-card>Oath of Chandra</auto-card> on turn two.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/29VAmZTSpsRCd304Vz3Vtk/f4c802e8d52ee2aa73b82ca90390126a/1920x1000-Matias-Leveratto-Rakdos-Sacrifice.jpg" /></div></div><br />

<p>Rakdos Sacrifice is another archetype that lines up well against Rakdos Midrange. The <auto-card>Mayhem Devil</auto-card> + <auto-card>Witch's Oven</auto-card> + <auto-card>Cauldron Familiar</auto-card> engine will often bury them in the late game, and if they try to generate early-game card advantage by Stomping one of your creatures, you'll just sacrifice it to <auto-card>Deadly Dispute</auto-card>. <auto-card>Claim the Firstborn</auto-card> and <auto-card>Kari Zev's Expertise</auto-card> also cleanly answer <auto-card>Misery's Shadow</auto-card> and <auto-card>Sheoldred, the Apocalypse</auto-card>, provided you have a sacrifice outlet.</p>

<p>2019 Mythic Championship winner Matias Leveratto put his faith in Rakdos Sacrifice, and his Top 4 finish at the South America Regional Championship earned him a Pro Tour invite.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/7y2T9p64x6d4qLwMPPXTlP/9b3a026e33de8b32466e1163369b7923/1920x1000-Manuel-Sinforoso-Gruul-Vehicles.jpg" /></div></div><br />

<p>Finally, a section on ways to beat Rakdos Midrange wouldn't be complete without mentioning the best <auto-card>Skysovereign, Consul Flagship</auto-card> deck: Gruul Vehicles. It had the highest win rate against the field out of all the top-tier archetypes, and it's one of the most reliable ways to crush Rakdos Midrange.</p>

<p>Manuel Sinforoso made the Top 8 at the South America Regional Championship with his version of Gruul Vehicles. His main deck features a few copies of <auto-card>Lightning Strike</auto-card> and <auto-card>Fable of the Mirror-Breaker</auto-card>, which provide a lower curve compared to the stock version that maxes out on <auto-card>The Akroan War</auto-card>. Sinforoso's sideboard features a little bit of everything; <auto-card>Cindervines</auto-card> is rising in popularity, and <auto-card>Glorybringer</auto-card> is great against midrange decks.</p>

<p>As long as Rakdos Midrange remains on top, Gruul Vehicles will be a solid choice, and Sinforoso's list is a good place to start.</p>

<h1>Looking Ahead</h1>

<p>The schedule for the remaining Regional Championships in this first round is as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>December 10-11</b>: <a href="https://f2ftour.com/event/f2f-tour-weekend-calgary-2022/" target="_blank">West Canada</a></li>

They played eight rounds of Pioneer before cutting to the Top 8, where Alejandro Sepulveda, piloting Mono-Red Aggro, emerged victorious. He earned invites to both Pro Tour I in Philadelphia, as well as the World Championship. Congratulations to Alejandro Sepulveda, South America's Regional Champion!</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/2efc936WtJWIKDqXyWZSHu/3b2062cfa22f7caf63f3165a3d3a0925/1920x1080-South-America-Magic-Series-Trophy.jpg" /><p class="embedImageCaption">Congratulations to Alejandro Sepulveda!</p></div></div><br />

<p>Sepulveda defeated Julian Prado in a finals match that reflected the wide open Pioneer metagame. Sepulveda's offbeat choice of Mono-Red Aggro was matched by Prado's own pick of Dimir Control, both decks that haven't made much of an impression on the metagame in the past two weekends of Regional Championships.</p>

Lee defeated Tzujui Huang, on Esper Control, in the finals. Lee earned qualifications to both Pro Tour I in Philadelphia, as well as next year's World Championship. His choice of Rakdos Midrange reflects the deck's rising popularity in recent weeks. As Lee said, "if you can't beat them, join them!"

# CONGRATULATIONS TO THE MIT CHAMPIONSHIP TOP 8

The MIT Championship had one of the most interesting sets of Top 8 decklists from a Regional Championship yet. Mono-White Humans made huge gains, putting three copies into the Top 8, while the increasingly popular Rakdos Midrange and the surprise Esper Control were represented in the finals.

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/1kyw8dj7eKuC1GvJGgJ9rW/5c4641782aa020c19659d62d9f8143e2/mit-top8.jpg" /><p class="embedImageCaption">MIT Champs Top 8 Group, caption: The MIT Championship Top 8: Cheng Yu Chang, Tsai ChingChi, Tzujui Huang, ChengHsun Lin, Josh Zhen, Shu-Yu Hsueh, Jim Tim Lee, and Se̍k-Un Khó</p></div></div><br />

Lee taking down the tournament with Rakdos Midrange reflects the deck's increasing popularity in the Pioneer metagame. It, along with Mono-White Humans, has seen some of the biggest gains since the opening weekend of Regional Championships in the middle of November.

<p>That's perhaps a misnomer these days, as it's not just Pro Tours – starting with the Pro Tour at <a href="https://magic30.mtgfestivals.com/en-us.html" target="_blank">MagicCon: Philadelphia</a> in just a few months – that draw up to a dozen competitors to share a rental for up to two weeks before a tournament with the sole intention of playing so much <i>Magic</i> that the result will be a material edge once play begins.</p>

<p>The history of high-level play owes a lot to these groups. Perhaps you can trace the origin of this all the way back to those early late '90s testing teams that were tearing up the scene at the time. But one is for certain: over the past decade of high-level <i>Magic,</i> these testing houses were the norm and result was teams emerging more prepared than anyone else in the room (or the world) for the Draft or Constructed format of choice.</p>

<p>Along the way, much <i>Magic</i> is played, and more made. The best stories to come from this tradition rarely had to do with exactly which card was higher in a draft order (though plenty of that was pretty important along the way, too).</p>

<embed-iframe fallback-img="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/1TzbKdTr0eC7lEIZh8S2hP/21f407e22dca180089c98aa97de01080/1920x1080_Blue_Background_Full.png" has-consent="true"   width="920" height="518" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z59M9DheHZ0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></embed-iframe>

<p>With the return of the testing house for recent in-person events (Andrea Mengucci and Javier Dominguez organized a lively one for the <a href="https://magic.gg/news/the-week-that-was-the-gathering-of-winners" target="_blank">Regional Championship in Bulgaria</a> last weekend), it's been a fun throwback as a new generation of Pro Tour players navigate their path and veterans return to the PT. Across the world, teams of <i>Magic</i> players are coming together to do what they dreamed of since their first Friday Night <i>Magic</i>: break the format.</p>

<p>So with the global string of Regional Championships in full swing, I've been thinking about the success of these testing teams – and today I want to focus on the "team" part of that. It might be easy to assume that when we say "teams of up to a dozen players" that it means 12 players who will be competing in the Pro Tour or World Championship in question. But that's not always the case; being a good teammate often means contributing without competing. It's not unheard of for some teams to have designated, non-qualified members dedicated to things like format tracking, draft orders or even cooking for the house – format-breaking is hungry work.</p>

<p>This is even more magnified when it comes to the highest level of competition; namely, the <a href="https://magic.gg/world-championship" target="_blank">World Championship</a>. The event has always been more exclusive than even the Pro Tour and while the size of the field itself has fluctuated over the years, the small-field nature of things has meant that players work in smaller groups. Finding help from those outside the tournament can be hard to come by. All in all, it's a little more complicated than you might expect for even the best players in the world to prepare for a World Championship tournament that often tests skills across multiple formats.</p>

<p>That's where Anthony Lee comes in.</p>

<p>A Pro Tour competitor in his own right, Lee was battling for his breakthrough to the next level. Working with some of the best teams from across the world, the Australian native had experienced his share of success – two Grand Prix Top 8s speak to that – but he never found success rising to the level of the World Championship.</p>

<p>His friends and teammates did, though. So Lee did what good teammates do: he threw in for the cause, with his time, expertise and strengths as a format analyst. He watched along with the rest of the world as his teammates played under the brightest lights, anxious for the chance to earn his own way there one day. He was such a dedicated part of the team that in the one case he couldn't make it, his team made sure he was there anyway – a life-size cardboard cutout of Lee graced the halls that weekend.</p>

<p>Well, after the Regional Championship for Australia/New Zealand last weekend, Lee won't be watching from the sidelines any longer, in cardboard form or no – he'll be competing at the World Championship in 2023 following his <a href="https://magic.gg/news/anthony-lee-wins-anz-super-series-finals-in-sidney" target="_blank">Regional Championship victory</a>.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Congratulations to the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ANZSuperSeries?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ANZSuperSeries</a> champion, Anthony Lee, who locks up a World Championship slot with this win! <a href="https://t.co/krKAFxGnjx">pic.twitter.com/krKAFxGnjx</a></p>&mdash; PlayMTG (@PlayMTG) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayMTG/status/1596744473374957568?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 27, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>"It's amazing to realize that I will get to play in a World Championship after helping competitors for the last five of them," Lee explained. "People were incredible supportive throughout the event, both on this side of the world and the rest as well, and I genuinely believe that meaningfully helped. Those are the people who make it worth coming all the way from Perth."</p>

<p>The format story from week one of the Regional Championship loop was that Mono-Green Devotion wasn't the boogeyman some had feared in Pioneer. The deck underperformed in the first set of events <a href="https://magic.gg/news/metagame-mentor-the-quadruple-regional-championship-weekend" target="_blank">(see Frank's column for more)</a> and the ANZ <i>Magic</i> Super Series Top 8 was more of the same – both of the deck's pilots were knocked out in the quarterfinals and the finals was a Rakdos Midrange mirror between Lee and former Grand Prix winner David Mines, whom Lee dispatched in two games to earn the title and invites to the first Pro Tour next year along with the 2023 World Championship.</p>

<p>"I was reasonably confident going into this event because of course being part of such a strong European testing team is undeniably a compelling advantage, but qualifying was far from a safe bet between both natural variance and that many Australian competitors have been reinvigorated by the return of competitive organized play that suits our region very well," Lee explained. "I was happy with how I played the games throughout the event and could feel how our preparation was getting me wins I wouldn't otherwise have gotten, which is one of the best things you can feel in an event. I had several very intense matches, whether because they involved sweating some critical draw steps or being very technically demanding, so the whole day was full of excitement."</p>

<p>A day of excitement, to put it lightly. Lee's friends and teammates who have been the beneficiaries of his generosity were ecstatic to watch him finally earn the landmark victory he's been working toward for years.</p>

<p>"Anthony's understanding of the game is very deep, and he's extremely good at figuring out how decks work and why," Dominguez gushed. "Anthony has been really helpful and supportive through all of my big <i>Magic</i> scores, and he has also been helping other friends out as well. I'm really excited for him, it is finally his time to play Worlds, and hopefully he takes it home!"</p>

<p>With his win, Lee has set himself up for a big 2023 with the World Championship tournament waiting for him at the end. But he's not making any concrete plans quite yet.</p>

<p>"I don't like to set specific goals and I very much believe in focusing on adapting as we see things unfold. So I'll try to keep doing what I've been doing for the last few years – making sure I contribute as much as I can to whatever testing groups I'm a part of, and whatever it brings me or my colleagues will be a gift," he explained. "So, basically, I have no idea what's next and I prefer it that way!"</p>

<p>While Lee may not want to know exactly what's coming next, the path to the Pro Tour and the World Championship rolls ever on. A handful of players added their names to the World Championship invite list last weekend, while dozens more qualified for the first Pro Tour of the year – and for many of them the first Pro Tour of their careers.</p>

<p>The Regional Championship in Japan/Korea was won by Rei Hirayama, who defeated Masamasa Kyogoku in another Rakdos mirror finals after a brilliant Top 8 that included Hall of Famers Shota Yasooka and Shuhei Nakamura. And it was Azorius Control that took Michael Martin Go to victory at the <a href="https://magic.gg/news/michael-martin-go-triumphs-at-mtg-sea-championships" target="_blank">Regional Championship for Southeast Asia</a>, adding another wrinkle to the settling Pioneer metagame.

<p>Hirayama was well-aware of the future available to him that had been made possible by the many greats who have come before him from Japan, and he took the time to honor one of this after his victory: the late <a href="https://magic.gg/news/the-week-that-was-the-gathering-of-winners" target="_blank">Kazuyuki Takimura</a>, who was also recognized with a <a href="https://mtg-jp.com/coverage/cc22f1/article/0036532/" target="_blank">special memorial at the event</a>.</p>

When the dust settled on the competition at the ANZ Super Series, it was the seasoned Pro Tour veteran Anthony Lee who rose above all other competitors with his Rakdos Midrange deck!

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/7aCV84ScvovU8h55uAe4Be/8e3e0c274b7e81a62dce390ac5b6b10e/Anthony-Lee-Trophy-3.jpg" /><p class="embedImageCaption">Congratulations to Anthony Lee!</p></div></div><br />

Rakdos was a very popular deck in Sydney this weekend, also propelling David Mines - who has led Australia to two WMC Top 8s in the past - into the final, where he ultimately fell to Lee. While both secured their spot at the Pro Tour with a top 12 finish, Lee also earned an invitation to the World Championship with his victory.

Lee will be a familiar face to many, as a member of world-class testing teams alongside the likes of Javier Dominguez and Marcio Carvalho. There are few players as experienced and well-equipped to represent Australia on Magic’s biggest stage at the World Championship!

Rakdos was the deck of the weekend, with four different players on the midrange deck in the Top 8. Mono-Green also put two players into the Top 8, with Mono-Blue Spirits and Lotus Field Combo rounding out the rest of the top decks. 

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/6oY2e1lUy60zpkMNcIkgRx/432df9052da9ea31570341e9a403bad4/anz-top-8.jpg" /><p class="embedImageCaption">Nick Malcolm Preston, David Mines, Steven Hitchcock, Daniel Riley, Dan Bretherton, Chris Miller, Anthony Lee, Brennan Crawford</p></div></div><br />

The top 12 players from the ANZ Super Series will be representing the Australia-New Zealand region at the first Pro Tour next year, taking place at MagicCon: Philadelphia in February. We can’t wait to see them all in Philly! 

Pioneer continued to evolve this weekend, as players adapted to the results from the big Regional Championships in North America, Europe, and Brazil the weekend before. Rakdos and Mono-Green were quite comfortably the most popular decks, with Izzet Phoenix and Abzan Greasefang not managing to break through the Swiss and into the Top 8.

More than anything else, however, it was the energy in Sydney that made the tournament so special. Players from across the region seeing one another for the first time in years, united once again in a love of competitive Magic, resulted in an incredible, positive atmosphere at the ANZ Super Series - the next Regional Championship looks to be as exciting as ever.

The format was Pioneer, and what a show the format put on - Rakdos and Mono-Green failed to deliver, and so we saw some very spicy decks succeed. 

In the end, however, it was Michael Martin Go with Azorius Control who won the day, dispatching Heng Chye Hwee’s Mono-White Humans in the final to lock up a World Championship invitation!

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/2q56AF2ZPSZfZw4RmUWDOD/e6be4edcaf2aadee4e5df8d0e8623d6b/sea-champ-photo.jpg" /><p class="embedImageCaption">Congratulations to Michael Martin Go!</p></div></div><br />

The Top 8 was filled with unexpected decks, and two of them met in the championship match. The aggression of Mono-White Aggro managed to win Heng Chye Hwee one game, at least, but the power of Azorius Control’s sweepers and removal was too much for Heng, and saw Go win 2-1.

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/66pecMswwFkMybHMCJMItT/90924f29c952149d3d075a1762744cda/sea-go-finals.jpg" /><p class="embedImageCaption">Michael Martin Go during the finals</p></div></div><br />

All the players in the Top 8 received invitations to the upcoming Pro Tour, taking place at MagicCon: Philadelphia in February. Let’s hope they bring equally spicy decks for us in Philly!

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/5djLwjl9kznetNs3VYO8Nb/3b2dc2b623ee78c46efd51730b0b0454/sea-top8.jpg" /><p class="embedImageCaption">The Top 8 from the SEA Championships</p></div></div><br />

As mentioned, the decks in the Top 8 were pretty wild. Only one copy of Rakdos Midrange made it in, despite Rakdos’ strong performances in other Regional Championships: instead, in addition to Azorius and Mono-White, there was Selesnya Auras, Selesnya Angels, and two different Fires of Invention decks!

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/4GGkiC3hoH77u5DOJ6W14B/9e644287889d86fae76cc237c34ceacf/sea-metagame.jpg" /></div></div><br />

Players also enjoyed a range of other events at the SEA Championships, as Magic fans around the world begin to gather once again and celebrate the game we all love. Players from around Southeast Asia got involved with Commander, drafts, and even Legacy in the side events, as well as a $5,000 Modern event on Sunday. It’s great to have competitive Magic back in full swing!

Tables filled with deckboxes and notepads. The hum of hundreds of players shuffling cards at the same time. The quiet that fills the room when a round begins, palpable to spectators gathered around the top tables—and pierced by the head judge chiming in.</p>

<p>Across, next to, behind, around... <a href="https://dreamhack.com/atlanta/magic/" target="_blank">DreamHack Atlanta</a>. Thousands of enthusiasts and competitors converging from across the continent to share in a passion for gaming, with thousands more watching along. Every step around the venue was an opportunity to stumble across a new game, a new cosplay, a new fandom or community—each as engaging as our own. That was DreamHack Atlanta, and it was there that the first <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Tournament/View/12649" target="_blank">US Regional Championship</a> was taking the stage while their counterparts in Europe and Brazil did the same, all in pursuit of Pro Tour and <a href="https://magic.gg/world-championship" target="_blank"><i>Magic</i> World Championship</a> invitations. It was an in-person <i>Magic</i> tournament, and that meant a lot to the players and people who worked hard to get back to here: high-stakes tabletop <i>Magic</i> with all the pressure and accolades that come.</p>

<p>Matthew Saypoff was right at home.</p>

<p>"I first started playing competitive tournaments 20 years ago, when my parents would drive me around to play in the Junior Super Series tournaments," he explained. "So when the news of the paper Pro Tour coming back came out, I had the competitive desire again."</p>

<p>With the fire came the battle, and a perfect demonstration of one of the strengths of competitive play: a local Brooklyn veteran went from a small Regional Championship Qualifier to the large-scale Regional Championship. And then he took the Pioneer field by storm with one of his favorite decks: <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/256856" target="_blank">Mono-White Humans</a>. He snuck into the Top 8 and then upset a Pro Tour winner in Eli Loveman in the quarterfinals. He kept up the momentum with a semifinals win, and then it all came together with a finals victory over Ken Takahama.</p>

<p>And like that, Saypoff went from local RCQs to qualifying for the World Championship, where he'll compete in 2023 thanks to his ascendant Regional Championship victory.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A huge congratulations to the Dreamhack Showdown Regional Champion, Matthew Saypoff with Mono-White Humans!<br><br>And Congrats to our finalist, Ken Takahama.

<p>"It's all so surreal," Saypoff explained. "My goal had been to make it to this event and then try and finish in the Top 48 to qualify for the paper Pro Tour; the rest would all be gravy. Before this I had a handful of PTQ Top 8s and Grand Prix cashes—it was enough to know I was good enough to do okay, but doing something like this is so completely unexpected. ... I'm ecstatic about the entire situation."</p>

<p>As my column-mate Frank Karsten reported from his Regional Championship experience in Sofia, Bulgaria, Regional Championship genuinely felt like the return of the "<a href="https://magic.gg/pro-tour" target="_blank">Pro Tour experience</a>." The fields in Atlanta and Sofia featured almost all of the best players rising to the top tables, we had World Champions organizing old-school testing houses, we had Hall of Famers hanging on round-by-round results on social media. With video coverage and big stakes and satellite events running hot–with the promise of the Pro Tour percolating through it all–it was clear "the gathering" was back, boosters and all.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Took this picture at the hotel with my prize winnings from today. Is it good enough for Twitter? <a href="https://t.co/ighr8CZaGl">pic.twitter.com/ighr8CZaGl</a></p>&mdash; Andrea Mengucci (@Mengu09) <a href="https://twitter.com/Mengu09/status/1594393239754113024?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 20, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>In the United States, Saypoff's Mono-White Humans deck took the diverse field by surprise—eight different decks in the Top 8—on his way to victory. Meanwhile, Pedro Mocelin stayed to the well-known path in Brazil's Regional Championship, defeating Jorgemi Sant'Anna in a Rakdos Midrange mirror in the City Class Games Showdown final to <a href="https://magic.gg/news/brazils-pedro-mocelin-wins-regional-title-at-city-class-showdown" target="_blank">win the title</a>.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/5YgoBYnC1C1ims0HcXmyx7/8c791a69b9cfc6b08d5cc8286b3a5a2d/ccs-pedro-mocelin-champion.png" /><p class="embedImageCaption">Pedro Mocelin</p></div></div><br />

<p>Mocelin's victory is a key part of the first weekend of Regional Championships, as it blasts another hole in the narrative that Mono-Green Devotion is the only deck in Pioneer worth playing at a high-level event. The deck's explosive <auto-card>Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx</auto-card>-fueled starts give it one of the highest ceilings in the format, and its proactive gameplan made it an easy choice for many of the 1,500 competitors. But in fact, despite leading the field at 20% Mono-Green managed a sub-50% winrate over three Regional Championships (Thanks for the insight, Frank!). Rakdos was the second-most popular archetype, and it boasted a better rate than the feared Devotion deck.</p>

<p>"I chose Rakdos because I like to stand a chance in all matches, and this deck gives you that," Mocelin explained. "<auto-card>Thoughtseize</auto-card> was my best card in the tournament; I like to have all the information I can to make the right plays."</p>

<p>Across the Atlantic, it was Madrid native Miguel Castro who took down the Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) Regional Championship, piloting Izzet Phoenix through a Top 8 that featured a handful of new faces on familiar archetypes (plus a sighting of the 2017 Italian national champion Adriano Moscato).</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/8W1Zeq4cdyFxkboXG7uoI/f71b7b6ad1e5b94dd6bce26078a18bd6/euro-champ-cycle-1-2022.png" /><p class="embedImageCaption">Miguel Castro</p></div></div><br />

<p>Castro was one of three Phoenix players in the Top 8 in Europe, the same deck that made the finals in America in Takahama's hands (one copy made the Top 8 of a diverse field in Brazil). Castro was one of the players who made a full experience of the EMEA Regional Championship, spending a week at a testing house with friends in advance of the tournament. Their conclusion was that in an open field like Pioneer where few decks held distinct advantages—a belief shared by most competitors I spoke to—was that playing a deck they were comfortable with trumped most other concerns, and Izzet Phoenix has long been the go-to deck in those kinds of circumstances.</p>

<p>And for good reason: it carried three players to the Top 8 and Castro to the title.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Matthew Saypoff</li>
	<li>Ken Takahama</li>
	<li>Miguel Castro</li>
	<li>Théau Méry</li>
	<li>Pedro Mocelin</li>
</ul>

<p>The World Championship invite list will continue to fill in the weeks ahead, as <i>Magic</i> dreams are made and the gathering continues. As for Saypoff, the Regional Championship victory is a long way—hundreds of miles and a couple of decades—from the 12-year-old who pestered his parents for rides to Friday Night <i>Magic</i>. At the same time, it's not all that far: he's still dreaming of the Pro Tour.</p>

<p>"I first discovered <i>Magic</i> when I went into my local hobby store to look at a Gundam model, and the players there taught me to play. I was immediately hooked as a 10-year-old," he recalled. "As a kid, I loved looking at all the different art. I got insanely into it and I was very fortunate to have a family that was supportive.</p>

<p>"That turned into playing as much as I could, and eventually I qualified for one of the online events. I felt like I could check it off my list, but then I learned I could make it onto the paper Pro Tour. So I worked really hard with my friend Dan Sondike, a well-known <i>Magic Online</i> player who was able to get us hooked up to other players on Discord. We did a lot theorcrafting about the format, and played in a <i>lot</i> of leagues. I'm really excited for next year, and I'm going to take it really seriously because the World Championship is an opportunity you can't pass up. But for the next few weeks at least, I'm looking forward to relaxing over the holidays and relaxing with some Cube!"</p>

<h1>Looking Ahead</h1>

<p>The schedule for the remaining Regional Championships in this first round is as follows (including those from over the weekend):</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>November 26-27</b>: <a href="https://ssl.bigmagic.net/championscup/factsheet-final" target="_blank">Japan/Korea</a>, <a href="https://www.anzmtg.com.au/super-series-finals/" target="_blank">Australia/New Zealand</a>, <a href="https://f2ftour.com/event/f2f-tour-weekend-toronto-2022/" target="_blank">East Canada</a>, <a href="https://www.mtgseachampionships.com/upcoming-events" target="_blank">Southeast Asia</a></li>
	<li><b>December 3-4</b>: <a href="https://gamesquare.tw/mit-register-3-1.php?cid=3" target="_blank">Chinese Taipei</a>, <a href="https://southamericamagicseries.com/regional-championship/" target="_blank">South America</a>, <a href="http://www.kadouevents.cn/" target="_blank">China </a></li>
	<li><b>December 10-11</b>: <a href="https://f2ftour.com/event/f2f-tour-weekend-calgary-2022/" target="_blank">West Canada</a></li>
	<li><b>December 17-18</b>: <a href="https://thegatheringseries.com/en/prizes/" target="_blank">Mexico/Central America/Caribbean</a></li>
</ul>

<p>It's not a stretch to say that these events will tell the story of 2023, even if we don't know what it is yet. But <i>Magic</i> history is filled with opportunities seized by upcoming players who make the Top 8 of a seemingly one-off event, only to announce themselves as a mainstay soon after. Is the next Chris Kvartek or Nathan Steuer or Yudai Miyano lurking among these tournaments fields? Almost certainly. And that what makes them so fun to watch play out—not to mention the impact this slate of events will have on Pioneer. (I'll leave that part to Frank to break down.)</p>

<p>The gathering is back, and the path to the Pro Tour marches on.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Metagame Mentor: Pioneer at the EMEA, US, and Brazilian Regional Championships</title><link>https://magic.gg/news/metagame-mentor-pioneer-at-the-emea-us-and-brazilian-regional-championships</link><guid>https://magic.gg/news/metagame-mentor-pioneer-at-the-emea-us-and-brazilian-regional-championships</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>Last weekend featured the debut of the Regional Championships, the thrice-yearly step on the path to the Pro Tour. In Europe, U.S.A., and Brazil, over 1500 total players arrived with their best Pioneer decks to compete for a combined 92 Pro Tour slots, 5 World Championship invitations, and $255,000 in prizes. And this was only the start of this Regional Championship season, as eight other geographic regions will follow in the weeks to come.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/DJPNxAlrmrCNwY5ZB7Fc6/a1e2363f540575f16e5741b149b2280d/1080x1080-Magic-Premier-Play-Path-2022-2023-Infographic.jpg" /></div></div><br />

<p>I competed in Sofia, Bulgaria myself, and it genuinely felt like high-level paper <i>Magic</i> again, with all the big names playing at the top tables and the excitement of win-and-ins for Pro Tours. This sentiment was echoed by many players I talked to, some of whom gathered in testing houses a week before the event. The tournament was well-ran, we had video coverage all weekend, and there were big prizes on the line. Even though I didn't win a lot of matches, I had a great time.</p>

<p>In this article, I will analyze all of last weekend's Regional Championships in a combined way. The article is structed as follows: First, I will celebrate the champions, who received well-earned trophies. Second, I will provide the combined metagame breakdown and the match win rates for all major archetypes. Third, I will showcase the most-played cards from <i>The Brothers' War</i>, as this was the first weekend in which the new set was legal. Fourth, I will go over the top deck archetypes in Pioneer right now. Fifth, I will highlight the spiciest decklists that earned a Pro Tour qualification. Sixth, I will look ahead to next weekend's Regional Championships. Let's get started.</p>

<h1>The Metagame and Win Rates</h1>

<p>Based on the decklists from all three Regional Championships, unweighted, I determined the combined metagame share of every archetype. I also calculated their non-mirror, non-bye match win rates. I used my own algorithms and definitions to assign archetype labels, thereby sidestepping any potential mislabeling on MTG Melee. Let's take a look!</p>

<p>The metagame across the three Regional Championships was largely many players expected. The most-popular archetype was Mono-Green Devotion, but it had a clear target on its head and scored a below-average win rate as a result. Players were ready for it, and no deck in Pioneer is unbeatable.</p>

<p>Lotus Field combo and Izzet Phoenix had an excellent performance; they were superb choices for the weekend, and I would expect to see them rise in popularity in the coming weeks. By contrast, Keruga Fires did poorly, largely as a result of a bad matchup against Mono-Green Devotion.</p>

<p>To me, the format looks diverse and balanced. The Top 8 of the U.S. Regional Championship had eight different deck archetypes, every color is represented, and the winrates of the most-played archetypes are close to 50-50. When this is the case, skill and expertise at piloting your deck and knowledge of your matchups and interactions is often the crucial factor.</p>

<p>As U.S. Regional Champion Matthew Saypoff said in his winner interview: "Any deck can do well in Pioneer … So it's really a matter of picking a deck you like the play pattern of and can get really good at."</p>

<h1>The Most-Played Cards from <i>The Brothers' War</i></h1>

<p>In last weekend's Regional Championships, the most-played cards overall, summing copies in both main decks and sideboards other than basic lands, were <auto-card>Llanowar Elves</auto-card>, <auto-card>Elvish Mystic</auto-card>, <auto-card>Fable of the Mirror-Breaker</auto-card>, <auto-card>Bonecrusher Giant</auto-card>, <auto-card>Thoughtseize</auto-card>, and <auto-card>Fatal Push</auto-card>. These are the real format staples of Pioneer that fit into multiple archetypes, but that shouldn't come as a surprise.</p>

<p>What's more interesting is the impact of <i>The Brothers' War</i> on Pioneer, as this was the first weekend where the new set was legal. The following table has the 25 most-played new-to-Pioneer cards in decklists submitted to last weekend's Regional Championships.</p>

<p>To show where some of these new cards found home, let's go over the top-tier decks in the metagame right now.</p>

<h1>The 8 Decks to Beat in Pioneer</h1>

<p>The eight decks I will highlight in this section include the four most popular archetypes—Mono-Green Devotion, Rakdos Midrange, Izzet Phoenix, and Mono-White Humans, all of which gained new cards from <i>The Brothers' War</i>—plus four promising archetypes that had a great performance last weekend. If you're unfamiliar with Pioneer, then I recommend reading <a href="https://www.magic.gg/news/metagame-mentor-pioneer-before-the-regional-championships" target="_blank">my format primer from last week</a> first.</p>

<p>All of the decklists I will show were played by players who placed highly enough to earn a Pro Tour invitation, so we'll see all of them at the Pro Tour held during <a href="https://magic30.mtgfestivals.com/en-us/home.html" target="_blank">MagicCon: Philadelphia</a> on February 17-19, 2023. In selecting specific decklists to highlight, I favored the ones with innovations from <i>The Brothers' War</i>.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/7Dcvi42lfHCFffte8Eqcrr/d97d9fbec747132af7b41f153bef741b/Mono-Green_Devotion.jpg" /></div></div><br />

<p>Mono-Green Devotion was the most popular deck archetype at 20.7% of the field, but it merely had a 48.6% non-mirror match win rate. According to the data, it was great against Rakdos Sacrifice and Keruga Fires but weak to Selesnya Auras, Boros Heroic, and Mono-Blue Spirits.</p>

<p>The deck did gain a lot of new cards from <i>The Brothers' War</i> to bolster <auto-card>Karn, the Great Creator</auto-card>, most notably <auto-card>The Stone Brain</auto-card>, <auto-card>Cityscape Leveler</auto-card>, and <auto-card>Haywire Mite</auto-card>. Many players included <auto-card>The Mightstone and Weakstone</auto-card> and <auto-card>Woodcaller Automaton</auto-card> as well.</p>

<p>Brent Vos, who finished 9th at the European Championship, went even further by running three total copies of <auto-card>Woodcaller Automaton</auto-card>: Two in the main deck and one in the sideboard. The main deck copies replaced flex slots customarily taken by <auto-card>Sylvan Caryatid</auto-card>, <auto-card>Lovestruck Beast</auto-card>, and/or <auto-card>Nicol Bolas, Dragon-God</auto-card>. The reason why <auto-card>Woodcaller Automaton</auto-card> fits so well is that it adds two devotion to green while untapping <auto-card>Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx</auto-card>. This makes it easier to generate absurd amounts of mana and combo off.</p>

<p>His list also goes against the mold by running 22 lands, which I believe to be the correct number. Little tweaks can go a long way.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/6ZrzXC3RwCHUdju7GRLd0I/a20f1c675abee862f6a69ed20fcdeeaa/Rakdos_Midrange.jpg" /></div></div><br />

<p>Rakdos Midrange was solid all around, with a 14.0% metagame share and a 50.4% match win rate. It was soft to Enigmatic Fires and Gruul Vehicles, but it performed well against Bant Spirits and Abzan Greasefang.</p>

<p>The most-played card overall from <i>The Brothers' War</i> was <auto-card>Misery's Shadow</auto-card>. Eli Loveman, who finished in the Top 8 of the U.S. Regional Championship, ran three copies in his Rakdos Midrange deck. Like <auto-card>Kalitas, Traitor of Ghet</auto-card>, it prevents the death triggers on <auto-card>Old-Growth Troll</auto-card> and <auto-card>Cavalier of Thorns</auto-card>, and it's a solid mana sink in the late game. Yet <auto-card>Misery's Shadow</auto-card> adds more pressure in the early game, which matters a lot in matchups where you have to be the aggressor.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/4LguGoZO5Yf117GS7RommI/58e5bdb53d08b760dc2804b39fcee7fe/Izzet_Phoenix.jpg" /></div></div><br />

<p>Izzet Phoenix had an excellent weekend, with a 11.3% metagame share and a 53.3% match win rate. (To give an indication of significance based on the sample size: the 95% Clopper-Pearson confidence interval for Izzet Phoenix's win rate ranged from 50.5% to 56.2%.) In terms of matchups, Izzet Phoenix was particularly strong against Mono-Blue Spirits, Bant Spirits, and all decks lumped in the "Other" category, yet it had a terrible time against Lotus Field combo.</p>

<p>A popular sideboard inclusion from the new set was <auto-card>Brotherhood's End</auto-card>. Miguel Castro, who won the European Championship, had two copies in his sideboard. It not only sweeps creatures and planeswalkers but also gives an out to <auto-card>Unlicensed Hearse</auto-card>. But this tweak was only a small part of his success—Miguel Castro had played <auto-card>Arclight Phoenix</auto-card> in Standard and Modern in the past, and he leaned on his extensive multi-format experience with the card to navigate the matches and claim the trophy.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/19Ht2C5nZB70TPSY37SNCb/e4d3d7c2f6bae710655ab001763872bb/Mono-White_Humans.jpg" /></div></div><br />

<p>Mono-White Humans was 6.2% of the field and posted a solid 51.9% match win rate. According to the data, it had a favorable matchup against Mono-Green Devotion, but it did terribly against Selesnya Angels, Rakdos Sacrifice, and Gruul Vehicles.</p>

<p><i>The Brothers' War</i> introduced <auto-card>Recruitment Officer</auto-card>, which has replaced <auto-card>Soldier of the Pantheon</auto-card> in most lists. Matthew Saypoff, who won the U.S. Regional Championship, had the full four copies in his main deck. The abilities on <auto-card>Soldier of the Pantheon</auto-card> rarely mattered, whereas <auto-card>Recruitment Officer</auto-card> offers a good mana sink to ensure you won't run out of steam in the late game. You're about 96% to hit at least one creature in your top 4 cards.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/D08TEt3ziiGl4IrmE31dR/401606755227ac8c6c050fcb2f3c6b7a/Gruul_Vehicles.jpg" /></div></div><br />

<p>Gruul Vehicles was 4.4% of the field and posted a solid 52.0% match win rate. According to the data, it performed particularly well against Rakdos Midrange and Mono-White Humans.</p>

<p><i>The Brothers' War</i> introduced <auto-card>Obliterating Bolt</auto-card> as an upgrade over <auto-card>Lava Coil</auto-card>. Lino Torretta, who finished 23rd at the European Championship, had the full four copies in his main deck. The ability to damage planeswalkers can make quite the difference against Mono-Green Devotion, although exiling <auto-card>Old-Growth Troll</auto-card> is still the main purpose of the card.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/33ZeXXFgMIMDsOwOg1D5Tm/5d93056858985fe60c78c420a06dc68f/Selesnya_Angels.jpg" /></div></div><br />

<p>Selesnya Angels was 2.4% of the field and posted an impressive 54.0% match win rate. According to the data, it crushed Mono-White Humans decisively.</p>

<p><i>The Brothers' War</i> introduced <auto-card>Brushland</auto-card> as a mana base upgrade over <auto-card>Sunpetal Grove</auto-card> and <auto-card>Kayla's Reconstruction</auto-card> as an additional <auto-card>Collected Company</auto-card> effect. In the list of Socrates Rozakeas, who finished 31st at the European Championship, <auto-card>Collected Company</auto-card> puts 1.86 creatures with total mana value 4.8 on the battlefield in expectation, and <auto-card>Kayla's Reconstruction</auto-card> for X=2 provides 1.92 creatures with total mana value 5.1 in expectation. So it's card advantage and mana advantage all in one.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/1xAm1gEVlEoscA14n8Shbm/816b82741944c2fd7ae43a6a8ff7fdca/Lotus-Field-combo-proper.jpg" /></div></div><br />

<p>Lotus Field combo was 1.8% of the field and posted an enormous 57.2% match win rate, which is the highest out all major archetypes. So it can be called the breakout deck of the weekend, and that's largely due to its amazing matchup against Izzet Phoenix.</p>

<p>The list of John Tatian, who finished in the Top 4 at the U.S. Regional Championship, did not contain any new cards from <i>The Brothers' War</i>, but he made sure he had <auto-card>Fae of Wishes</auto-card> to diversify his win conditions against opposing <auto-card>The Stone Brain</auto-card>.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/1mf9e7QxavHqrrLbzxNZa8/b6b3013fc4eeb3f5f2e12e9b9d56f5de/Selesnya_Auras_proper.png" /></div></div><br />

<p>Selesnya Auras was merely 0.5% of the field, which may seem low until you realize that it basically didn't exist in the competitive landscape before <i>The Brothers' War</i>. Yet it posted a very promising 54.7% match win rate. According to the data, it decisively crushed Mono-Green Devotion in particular.</p>

<p>This is all largely due to the addition of <auto-card>Brushland</auto-card>. In a deck that wants to cast <auto-card>Gladecover Scout</auto-card> on turn one followed by <auto-card>Ethereal Armor</auto-card> and <auto-card>Sentinel's Eyes</auto-card> on turn two, you need every untapped dual land you can get. <auto-card>Brushland</auto-card> is a massive consistency boost.</p>

<p>In addition, <auto-card>Audacity</auto-card> is reminiscent of <auto-card>Rancor</auto-card> and is perfect for a deck that wants to boost its creatures with Auras while drawing cards with <auto-card>Sram, Senior Edificer</auto-card> and fetching one-ofs with <auto-card>Light-Paws, Emperor's Voice</auto-card>. Michael Letsch crafted a superb list and made the Top 4 at the U.S. Regional Championship.</p>

<h1>Spice Corner</h1>

<p>It's always exciting to see brewers do well with their own creations, and the top tables of the Regional Championships featured plenty of decks that no one or almost no one had on their radar. To support this, I'll highlight the three spiciest decks from the Regional Championships to earn a Pro Tour qualification. I am already looking forward to seeing what these players might bring to the Pro Tour in February, as the depth of Pioneer remains underexplored.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/66eXHYe89Sbw9fD4SznPxP/0bc8a564278d54c91c3c5b60cc155d0d/Storm_Herald_combo.jpg" /></div></div><br />

<p>Pro Tour <i>Amonkhet</i> Top 8 competitor Marc Tobiasch always brews the spiciest decks, and he didn't disappoint at the European Championship. He finished 21st with a deck that no one saw coming.</p>

<p>The game plan of this deck is to put <auto-card>Colossification</auto-card> and <auto-card>Burning Anger</auto-card> into the graveyard and to return them to the battlefield with <auto-card>Storm Herald</auto-card>. This allows you to immediately ping your opponent for upwards of 20 damage. The deck has numerous self-mill cards and discard enablers to put the Auras into the graveyard, while <auto-card>Gather the Pack</auto-card> and <auto-card>Traverse the Ulvenwald</auto-card> can find <auto-card>Storm Herald</auto-card>.</p>

<p>At first glance, this combo might seem inferior to <auto-card>Greasefang, Okiba Boss</auto-card> plus <auto-card>Parhelion II</auto-card>, which needs only one card in the graveyard rather than two. Why go through extra steps? The answer is that <auto-card>Storm Herald</auto-card> combo plays much better against removal. When <auto-card>Storm Herald</auto-card>'s enters-the-battlefield trigger resolves, you may attach your Auras to any creature you control. It doesn't target. So if you have another untapped creature, say a <auto-card>Satyr Wayfinder</auto-card>, then a single spot removal spell won't break up your combo. That's a big benefit over Abzan Greasefang.</p>

<p>Another benefit is that <auto-card>Storm Herald</auto-card> doesn't target the Auras in your graveyard, so you can run <auto-card>Silent Gravestone</auto-card> in your sideboard to stop your opponent's <auto-card>Graveyard Trespasser</auto-card> and <auto-card>Unlicensed Hearse</auto-card>. Genius!</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/32TsMy6tI1vyocS00bx8i8/9c101a79a09a102a07a399dab94bc524/Grinning_Ignus_combo.jpg" /></div></div><br />

<p>Dimitar Erinin, who finished 17th at the European Championship, showed that <auto-card>Grinning Ignus</auto-card> combo is the real deal. After winning the Warsaw Classic Qualifier—a large RCQ—last month, he took the deck to win the <auto-card>Last Chance</auto-card> Qualifier on Friday in Sofia, and then he promptly went 9-0 on Day 1! Overnght, he found himself on top of the standings as the sole undefeated player in the European Championship. On Day 2, he won enough matches to clinch a Pro Tour invite. If he sticks with the same deck, then he's definitely a player to watch.</p>

<p>So what does the deck actually do? The game plan is to continually cast <auto-card>Grinning Ignus</auto-card> while controlling <auto-card>Birgi, God of Storytelling</auto-card>, <auto-card>Hazoret's Monument</auto-card>, or <auto-card>Runaway Steam-Kin</auto-card>. This generates infinite enters-the-battlefield triggers, which then turns into infinite cards with <auto-card>Risen Reef</auto-card>, infinite life with <auto-card>Prosperous Innkeeper</auto-card>, or infinite damage with <auto-card>Defiler of Instinct</auto-card>. <auto-card>Fauna Shaman</auto-card> from <i>The Brothers' War</i> added a small consistency boost.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/59wMHsYDBirxOVdUj2LttC/7c59a17d103fbd63e54e580d1c65f212/Selesnya_Company.jpg" /></div></div><br />

<p>Grand Prix Sao Paulo 2014 champion Tulio Jaudy is another renowned deck builder, and he made the Top 8 of the Brazil Regional Championship with a spicy brew.</p>

<p>As he explained, "I wanted to play a deck that could play well against all matchups, with aggressive and controlling capabilities, and some toolboxing to help some situations and adapt. Also, it has access to a combo-ish finish, which can outpace the combo decks." Indeed, being able to loop <auto-card>Charming Prince</auto-card> and <auto-card>Yorion, Sky Nomad</auto-card> can overpower anyone, and chaining <auto-card>Chord of Calling</auto-card> into <auto-card>Fierce Empath</auto-card> into <auto-card>Decimator of the Provinces</auto-card> is another sweet combo-esque way to win the game.</p>

<p>Yet the defining feature of his deck are the various disruptive creatures or "hatebears". <auto-card>Phyrexian Revoker</auto-card> stops planeswalkers, <auto-card>Scavenging Ooze</auto-card> eats graveyards, and <auto-card>Voice of Resurgence</auto-card> stops interaction on your turn. <auto-card>Anointed Peacekeeper</auto-card>, which Jaudy mentioned as the best card of his weekend, fills a similar role. "Should've played four copies of it."</p>

<h1>Looking Ahead</h1>

They played eight rounds of Pioneer before cutting to a Top 8, where Pedro Mocelin, piloting Rakdos Midrange, emerged victorious. Congratulations to Pedro Mocelin, winner of the City Class Showdown and Brazil's Regional Champion!

Mocelin defeated Jorgemi Sant'Anna, also on Rakdos Midrange, in the finals. In addition to earning a Pro Tour invite, Mocelin's win also secured him an invite to next year's World Championship. Mocelin chose Rakdos Midrange because "I like to stand a chance in all matches and this deck gives me this chance."

# Back to the Gathering

It was a great weekend of Magic around the world as the first set of Regional Championships kicked off. While Mono-Green Devotion was the most played deck at the City Class Showdown, it only put a single copy into the Top 8, and the metagame breakdown also spoke to a format that still has a lot of room for exploration;

Saypoff faced off against Ken Takahama in the finals, and their match went a full three games. Ultimately, Saypoff and his Mono-White Humans list bested Takahama on Izzet Phoenix.

# NO REPETITIONS IN THE TOP 8

The format for all Regional Championships this cycle is Pioneer, and it’s proving to be a diverse metagame. The Top 8 decks in Atlanta were all unique, with no repetitions in archetypes. Popular choices like Mono-Green Devotion and Izzet Phoenix clashed with less-played decks like Selesnya Auras.

# TOP 48 PLAYERS QUALIFY FOR THE PRO TOUR

Congratulations as well to the Top 48 players at the DreamHack Magic Showdown for earning invites to Pro Tour I at MagicCon Philadelphia next February!

# BACK TO THE GATHERING

It was a stellar weekend of watching players get back to in-person competitive play all over the world, and we can’t wait to see them all come together at Pro Tour I in Philadelphia next year! 

The Pioneer metagame was wide-open, with some of the most popular decks barely able to break into the Top 8.

On Saturday morning, 409 competitors from the Europe / Middle East / Africa region, mostly qualified via Regional Championship Qualifiers (RCQs), arrived at the Inter Expo Center in Sofia, Bulgaria. After fifteen rounds of Pioneer and a Top 8 playoff, we can say congratulations to our new European champion.</p>

<h1>Miguel Castro Takes the Trophy With Izzet Phoenix</h1>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/8W1Zeq4cdyFxkboXG7uoI/f71b7b6ad1e5b94dd6bce26078a18bd6/euro-champ-cycle-1-2022.png" /><p class="embedImageCaption">Miguel Castro, European Champion</p></div></div><br />

<p>Miguel Castro, a 29-year-old <i>Magic</i> player from Madrid, Spain, was no newcomer to competitive <i>Magic</i>. As a member of team Show &amp; Tell MTG, his previous <i>Magic</i> accomplishments included two Grand Prix Top 8s and six Pro Tour appearances. But becoming the European Champion eclipses all that. It comes with a trophy, $16,000 in prizes, and the ability to call yourself the best <i>Magic</i> player in Europe.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/1E4gewnFck0vgU8vhs4Mpb/bd9c3cc2b4db55bcf99d4705af00bfa7/lec-sofia-castro-finals.png" /><p class="embedImageCaption">Miguel Castro in the finals</p></div></div><br />

<p>Miguel Castro's Pioneer deck was Izzet Phoenix: "It is the deck I used to qualify in an RCQ, and I have played Phoenix in Standard and Modern in the past. After preparing for the event—I came a week before to a testing house with some friends—I was happy with the deck and the plan."</p>

<p>This plan involved <auto-card>Crackling Drake</auto-card> to beat <auto-card>Rest in Peace</auto-card> after sideboard, which is exactly how he won the decisive third game in the finals.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/58lgFlE64LaqIfEJqqqJJc/5118f991c2805c3cfa5ee0eebc785740/lec-sofia-theau-mery-finals.png" /><p class="embedImageCaption">Théau Méry in the finals</p></div></div><br />

<p>In the finals, he defeated Théau Méry, who also prepared for a week in Sofia, in a French testing house. You may know Méry from the podcast "Podcaster Mage" or from his two Grand Prix finals appearances. Since he hails from Nantes, the hometown of Hall of Famer Guillaume Wafo-Tapa, Méry played Azorius Control: "I live in Nantes and as the tradition says and as Wafo says, you got to play it if you live there."</p>

<p>With their performance, Miguel Castro and Théau Méry both earned an invitation to the World Championship in 2023. Congratulations!</p>

<h1>Three Izzet Phoenix Decks in the Top 8</h1>

<p>Congratulations to all <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayMTG/status/1594346469477294082" target="_blank">Top 8 players</a>! The defining deck of the tournament was Izzet Phoenix, which not only won the event but also put three players in the Top 8, all of whom won their quarterfinals.</p>

<p><auto-card>Brotherhood's End</auto-card> for the sideboard was an important addition from <i>The Brothers' War</i>, besides <auto-card>Misery's Shadow</auto-card>, <auto-card>The Stone Brain</auto-card>, <auto-card>Obliterating Bolt</auto-card>, and other cards for other archetypes.</p>

The main way to qualify for the Pro Tour is by placing highly at a Regional Championship, and this weekend features the very first of those!</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/DJPNxAlrmrCNwY5ZB7Fc6/a1e2363f540575f16e5741b149b2280d/1080x1080-Magic-Premier-Play-Path-2022-2023-Infographic.jpg" /></div></div><br />

<p>In today's article, I'll summarize key details of this first round of Regional Championships, and I will provide an overview of the Constructed format, Pioneer, right before the release of <i>The Brothers' War</i>.</p>

<h1>Regional Championship Guide</h1>

<p><b>Format</b>: For all of these first Regional Championships, the format is Pioneer, and <i>The Brothers' War</i> will be legal. (In 2023, the format for the second round will be Standard, and the format for the third round will be Pioneer.)</p>

<p><b>Decklists</b>: Regional Championships will use open decklists, to be submitted by competitors on <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/" target="_blank">MTG Melee</a> on the day before the event starts. Exact details and timing are provided by the local organizer. Once the event gets underway, decklists will become publicly available and you can follow the standings live. To do so, bookmark the MTG Melee pages for the Regional Championships held in <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Tournament/View/12649" target="_blank">U.S.A</a>, <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Tournament/View/12521" target="_blank">Europe</a>, and <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Tournament/View/12349" target="_blank">Brazil</a>. For more updates on the events, follow the regional organizers for <a href="https://twitter.com/DreamHack" target="_blank">U.S.A.</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/LegacyEUTour" target="_blank">Europe</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/CityClassGames" target="_blank">Brazil</a> on Twitter, or keep an eye on our <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayMTG" target="_blank">@PlayMTG account</a>.</p>

<p><b>Invites</b>: Regional Championships are invitation-only events. Most of the invites stem from Regional Championship Qualifiers (RCQs) held at local stores or larger conventions in July, August, and September of this year. On the Friday before each Regional Championship, the event hall can also hold Last Chance Qualifiers. Additional invitees include players who qualified through <i>Magic Online</i> or <i>MTG Arena</i>, members of the 2021-22 <i>Magic</i> Pro League and <i>Magic</i> Rivals League, top challengers from that season, and members of the Hall of Fame who use their "once-per-year" invite. More precise details can be found <a href="https://magic.gg/news/return-of-the-pro-tour-details" target="_blank">here</a>. All in all, the level of competition will be fierce, and many of the best players in each region will be in attendance.</p>

<p><b>Prizes</b>: Besides <auto-card>Teferi, Hero of Dominaria</auto-card> promo cards and monetary prizes, which total $100,000 in Europe and $130,000 in the U.S.A., top players from each Regional Championship will qualify for the first Pro Tour, to be held at <a href="https://magic30.mtgfestivals.com/en-us/home.html" target="_blank">MagicCon: Philadelphia</a> on February 17-19. The exact number of Pro Tour invites differs per region. For example, it's 36 in Europe and 48 in U.S.A. Additionally, all Regional Championship winners, as well as the runners-up from U.S.A., Japan, and Europe, will be invited to the World Championship in 2023. All in all, these are big, big events, with a lot on the line.</p>

<p><b>Video coverage in Europe</b>: The Regional Championships in Sofia, Bulgaria will be livestreamed on <a href="https://www.Twitch.tv/legacyeuropeantour" target="_blank">Twitch.tv/legacyeuropeantour</a>. The <a href="https://twitter.com/LegacyEUTour/status/1586281697682792449" target="_blank">commentators are Matej Zatlkaj, TheWillHallExp, Filipa Carola, and HarryMTG</a>. The two-day event starts on Saturday November 19 at 9 a.m. EET (8 a.m. CET / 2 a.m. ET).</p>

<p><b>Video coverage in U.S.A.</b>: The Regional Championships in Atlanta, Georgia will be livestreamed at <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/DreamHackMagic" target="_blank">Twitch.tv/DreamHackMagic</a>. The <a href="https://twitter.com/anzidmtg/status/1593346910391263235" target="_blank">commentators are Corey Baumeister, Eilidh Lonie, Mani Davoudi, and Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa</a>. The livestream of this two-day event starts on Saturday November 19 at 12 p.m. ET (9 a.m. PT / 6 p.m. CET).</p>

<p>I'm excited to see the next step in premier play take shape! I hope everyone will have a great time this and coming weekends, whether you're competing, cheering on your favorite players, or following the events otherwise. If you would like to test your mettle in future Regional Championships, then you can find RCQs around you by using the <a href="https://locator.wizards.com/" target="_blank">store and event locator</a> with the filter "Regional Championship Qualifier" and/or by visiting your <a href="https://magic.gg/pro-tour?section=regional-championships#pro-tour" target="_blank">regional organizer's</a> website.</p>

<h1>Pioneer Metagame Snapshot</h1>

<p><a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/formats/pioneer" target="_blank">Pioneer</a> is a nonrotating format based on expansion sets and core sets from <i>Return to Ravnica</i> forward, and the most notable cards on <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/banned-restricted-list#pioneer-banned" target="_blank">the ban list</a> are the fetch lands.</p>

<p>To provide a metagame snapshot that combines popularity and performance, I used decklists from competitive events over the past few weeks. Specifically, I used all available <a href="https://www.mtgo.com/en/mtgo/decklists" target="_blank"><i>Magic Online</i> decklists</a> from Pioneer Preliminary and Pioneer Challenge events held from October 28 through November 15. (Due to publication issues, at the time of writing there were no such decklists available from events held after November 8.) In addition, I used Top 8 decklists from the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/RNGGamesPG/posts/pfbid0ehY49g3uydbd2bfRcMc3fE7kSGQC3TX6r1HPx7NW6kPuH3uv6N2rjuuGcctBjNe4l" target="_blank">RCQ at RNG Games</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/gameshavensg/posts/pfbid0ouU7bdhyL9kC1XzR6dGyk63gea4DpFyX7amErp7xjYCFUb3sRQQPJREqxu6g9P24l" target="_blank">RCQ at Games Haven</a>, and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=548880940578694&amp;id=100063703792050" target="_blank">RCQ at Block 101 Hobbies Store</a>, and I used decklists with at most one more loss than win from the <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Tournament/View/11718" target="_blank">NRG Series $5K Trial Fort Wayne</a>, <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Tournament/View/11888" target="_blank">SCG CON 1 p.m. Trial</a>, <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Tournament/View/11889" target="_blank">SCG CON 4 p.m. Trial</a>, <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Tournament/View/11890" target="_blank">SCG CON $30K RCQ</a>, and <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Tournament/View/11892" target="_blank">SCG CON $5K RCQ.</a> This yielded 687 decks, with archetype labels algorithmically assigned by me.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Congratulations to your <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MTG?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MTG</a> Pioneer $30K champion...<a href="https://twitter.com/BlsmcVinn?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@BlsmcVinn</a> 🏆<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SCGCON?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#SCGCON</a> <a href="https://t.co/1heWMJBQaB">pic.twitter.com/1heWMJBQaB</a></p>&mdash; SCG CON (@SCGCON) <a href="https://twitter.com/SCGCON/status/1591918532270620673?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 13, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>A large source of decklists was last weekend's SCG CON in Philadelphia. It featured several RCQs that awarded invitations for the second Regional Championship, which can be scheduled between February 25 and April 9 in 2023. In the finals of the 288-player $30K event at SCG CON, Vincent Vitanza, playing <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/253665" target="_blank">Gruul Vehicles</a>, defeated Dan Jessup, playing <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/253529" target="_blank">Rakdos Midrange</a>. <auto-card>Skysovereign, Consul Flagship</auto-card> was one of the key cards; in <a href="https://twitter.com/BlsmcVinn/status/1591924184988487681" target="_blank">the words of the champion</a>, "Boat boat boat boat BOOOOOAT!"</p>

<p>But we'll get to the boats later. For each deck I used from SCG CON and the other competitive events, I assigned a number of points equal to its rectified number of match wins minus its number of match losses. For example, a deck that went 5–1 in the Swiss followed by a loss in the quarterfinals was assigned three points. The sum of these numbers for every archetype was then used to determine its record-weighted metagame share, which represents its share of total net wins. In the table below, archetype names hyperlink to a well-performing decklist closest to the aggregate of the archetype.</p>

The number of competitively viable Pioneer archetypes remains enormous.</p>

<p>The most-played nonland cards across all main decks and sideboards were <auto-card>Fable of the Mirror-Breaker</auto-card>, <auto-card>Thoughtseize</auto-card>, <auto-card>Fatal Push</auto-card>, <auto-card>Bonecrusher Giant</auto-card>, <auto-card>Mystical Dispute</auto-card>, <auto-card>Llanowar Elves</auto-card>, <auto-card>Elvish Mystic</auto-card>, and <auto-card>Unlicensed Hearse</auto-card>. These are the true staples of the format.</p>

<p>The breakdown in the above table could be interpreted as a winner's metagame, i.e., a distribution of the types of decks that you could expect to face at the top tables if you were to make a deep run in a Pioneer tournament over the last few weeks. The top four archetypes in the metagame right now are Green Devotion, Izzet Phoenix, Rakdos Midrange, and Mono-White Humans. The biggest developments since <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/feature/metagame-mentor-pioneer-metagame-roundup-october-2022" target="_blank">my previous Pioneer analysis in October</a> are the uptick for Izzet Phoenix, the emergence of Keruga Fires, and the downtick in Rakdos Midrange.</p>

<p>To showcase good, typical lists for all archetypes with at least a 2% record-weighted metagame share, I used a proprietary aggregation method that combines popularity and performance. The core of the method was explained in <a href="https://strategy.channelfireball.com/all-strategy/mtg/channelmagic-articles/magic-math-a-new-way-to-determine-an-aggregate-deck-list-rg-dragons/" target="_blank">an article</a>, but I have since extended it by considering win rates, sideboards, companions, land counts, and other relevant aspects, inspired by the theory behind artificial neural networks. It provides a systematic way to pinpoint the top fourteen "Decks to Beat" in Pioneer right before the release of <i>The Brothers' War</i>. Let's take a look.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Green_Devotion____ece2bcda-3b7f-4f50-b920-cd070aa58f94===

<p>Green Devotion, at 13.8% of the winner's metagame, has been the #1 archetype in Pioneer for a while. With Elves and <auto-card>Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx</auto-card>, you can potentially ramp into a turn-three <auto-card>Storm the Festival</auto-card> and put <auto-card>Karn, the Great Creator</auto-card> and <auto-card>Cavalier of Thorns</auto-card> onto the battlefield. With such raw power, it can go over the top of midrange decks. However, it is weak to blazingly fast aggro decks, which can exploit Green Devotion's lack of creature removal and reliance on expensive spells.</p>

<p>When playing against this deck, you should be aware that Green Devotion is capable of convoluted infinite loops. In tabletop events, I recommend using pen and paper to track your opponent's mana in pool, potential land drop for the turn, the number of <auto-card>The Chain Veil</auto-card> activations, the number of times <auto-card>Karn, the Great Creator</auto-card> has been activated, and the number of times <auto-card>Kiora, Behemoth Beckoner</auto-card> has been activated. This way, you'll make sure the game state remains clear and accurate.</p>

<p><i>The Brothers' War</i> will introduce a lot of cards that could bolster <auto-card>Karn, the Great Creator</auto-card>. New sideboard options include Cityscape Leveler, Haywire Mite, The Stone Brain, Woodcaller Automaton, The Stasis Coffin, The Mightstone and Weakstone, and Portal to Phyrexia. We'll see this weekend which ones deserve a slot and how impactful they are.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Izzet_Phoenix____eeb8a96b-67de-4df0-ba4c-692dfc2c6b71===

<p>Izzet Phoenix, also at 13.8% of the record-weighted metagame, has been on the rise and is now basically tied with Green Devotion in terms of metagame dominance. The game plan is to put multiple <auto-card>Arclight Phoenix</auto-card> into the graveyard, typically via <auto-card>Pieces of the Puzzle</auto-card> or <auto-card>Lightning Axe</auto-card>, and then recur them by chaining three one-mana spells in a single turn. <auto-card>Ledger Shredder</auto-card>, which has edged out <auto-card>Thing in the Ice</auto-card> in most lists, is also a good way to set up your graveyard.</p>

<p>When playing against this deck, try to avoid jamming into <auto-card>Spell Pierce</auto-card> if you can avoid it. It's usually only a two-of, but if your opponent is conspicuously holding a blue mana up, then consider casting a noncreature spell instead. Also, keep in mind that Izzet Phoenix is capable of copying <auto-card>Treasure Cruise</auto-card> or <auto-card>Temporal Trespass</auto-card> with <auto-card>Galvanic Iteration</auto-card>, which is often a game-winning play.</p>

<p><i>The Brothers' War</i> introduces Brotherhood's End, which may be superior to <auto-card>Sweltering Suns</auto-card> from the sideboard. It not only damages planeswalkers but also gives you an out to <auto-card>Unlicensed Hearse</auto-card>. The artifact is a popular sideboard card against Izzet Phoenix, and Brotherhood's End may help to fight back.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Rakdos_Midrange____5e68e4f0-f5dd-42e3-81f4-fc909ff5e31e===

<p>Rakdos Midrange, at 9.5% of the winner's metagame, has been on the downtick over the past few weeks, but it's still the premier traditional midrange deck in Pioneer. Featuring discard, removal, value-generating permanents, and mid-sized creatures, it can take the role of an aggro deck against control players or the role of a control deck against aggro players. Add a flexible sideboard, and Rakdos Midrange has the tools to fight anything, especially creature decks. From <i>Dominaria United</i>, <auto-card>Liliana of the Veil</auto-card> has not lived up to expectations, but <auto-card>Sheoldred, the Apocalypse</auto-card> has established a home in most lists.</p>

<p>When playing against this deck, you should mulligan slightly less aggressively than you otherwise might because you'll need all the resources you can muster. If you mulligan aggressively in search of certain key cards, then that will often be foiled by <auto-card>Thoughtseize</auto-card> and <auto-card>Dreadbore</auto-card>. When they deprive you of further resources with <auto-card>Kroxa, Titan of Death's Hunger</auto-card>, mulligans look even less appealing. Against Rakdos Midrange, you need raw cardboard, so a mediocre seven-card hand is often better than a synergistic six-card hand.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Mono-White_Humans____d86f9995-8a5e-4acc-8652-4e42cecca9fb===

<p>Mono-White Humans, at 8.8% of the record-weighted metagame, is the premier aggro deck in Pioneer. Human tribal decks in Pioneer come in many colors, but all of them rally around <auto-card>Thalia's Lieutenant</auto-card>. The benefit of staying mono-color is that you can effortlessly fit <auto-card>Mutavault</auto-card> and <auto-card>Castle Ardenvale</auto-card> into your mana base and that you can steal games with <auto-card>Brave the Elements</auto-card>.</p>

<p>When playing against this deck, you should always have surprise lethal of <auto-card>Brave the Elements</auto-card> in mind. The instant can not only counter removal spells but also provides a massive burst of damage past your opponent's blockers. <auto-card>Consider</auto-card> blocking and trading off early to avoid the crowded battlefields where the card excels. Also remember that <auto-card>Mutavault</auto-card> is colorless.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Azorius_Control____f4849cdb-6249-4097-a0cc-764f49e61687===

<p>Azorius Control, at 6.7% of the winner's metagame, is the premier control deck in Pioneer. It has all the typical ingredients you might expect: Spot removal, countermagic, card draw, sweepers and planeswalkers. Nearly everyone over the past few weeks opted for a 60-card version, steering clear of <auto-card>Yorion, Sky Nomad</auto-card> to get better consistency.</p>

<p>When playing against this deck, you always have to be wary of sweepers and countermagic. Don't overextend your threats into <auto-card>Supreme Verdict</auto-card>, and sometimes play a cheaper but worse spell to play around <auto-card>Censor</auto-card>. Their exact suite of answers is always changing; lately in Azorius Control main decks, we're seeing more <auto-card>Temporary Lockdown</auto-card> and <auto-card>Make Disappear</auto-card> and fewer <auto-card>Portable Hole</auto-card> and <auto-card>Detention Sphere</auto-card>. In sideboards, <auto-card>Settle the Wreckage</auto-card> has returned as well. Every Azorius Control list is different, but these are relevant aggregate trends.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Lotus_Field____7c52cde2-0140-46c8-989c-86cf7014077b===

<p><auto-card>Lotus Field</auto-card>, at 5.8% of the record-weighted metagame, has made a comeback as the premier combo deck in Pioneer, perhaps with the intention to prey on Izzet Phoenix. The game plan is to find <auto-card>Lotus Field</auto-card>, get another copy via <auto-card>Thespian's Stage</auto-card>, and untap those lands with <auto-card>Hidden Strings</auto-card> and <auto-card>Pore Over the Pages</auto-card>. This allows you to generate loads of mana in a single turn. Through some wild combination of <auto-card>Emergent Ultimatum</auto-card>s, wishes, and tutors, you then generally put <auto-card>Omniscience</auto-card> into play, grab <auto-card>Approach of the Second Sun</auto-card> from your sideboard, and cast it twice to win the game.</p>

<p>From <i>The Brothers' War</i>, The Stone Brain could be a problem for this deck. Previously, <auto-card>Karn, the Great Creator</auto-card> would grab <auto-card>Damping Sphere</auto-card> to nullify <auto-card>Lotus Field</auto-card>, but that artifact was easily destroyed by <auto-card>Boseiju, Who Endures</auto-card>. Now, Karn unlocks The Stone Brain to exile <auto-card>Mastermind's Acquisition</auto-card>, after which the list shown above may no longer be able to win. I'd expect <auto-card>Lotus Field</auto-card> players to add <auto-card>Fae of Wishes</auto-card> // Granted to diversify their win conditions.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Keruga_Fires____d75bcc76-58c6-4a83-8bf4-1545fcfbf43e===

<p>Keruga Fires, at 5.1% of the record-weighted metagame, has rapidly emerged as a prominent archetype over the past few weeks, perhaps also with the intention to prey on Izzet Phoenix. The key cards in the deck are <auto-card>Keruga, the Macrosage</auto-card> and <auto-card>Fires of Invention</auto-card>. <auto-card>Fires of Invention</auto-card> essentially doubles up your mana while allowing you to spend your lands on <auto-card>Kenrith, the Returned King</auto-card>'s activated abilities. <auto-card>Keruga, the Macrosage</auto-card> comes with a substantial companion restriction, but it can create massive card advantage, especially when you control <auto-card>Fires of Invention</auto-card>.</p>

<p>When playing against this deck, remember that their only ways to do something for less than three mana are <auto-card>Bonecrusher Giant</auto-card>'s adventure, <auto-card>Mystical Dispute</auto-card> from the sideboard, and <auto-card>Leyline Binding</auto-card>. Always keep an eye on their domain count because that determines the cost of <auto-card>Leyline Binding</auto-card>.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Bant_Spirits____b73035d1-ff03-4d2c-8e26-592dea42f55e===

<p>Bant Spirits, at 4.3% of the winner's metagame, is the most prominent home for <auto-card>Mausoleum Wanderer</auto-card>, <auto-card>Shacklegeist</auto-card>, and <auto-card>Supreme Phantom</auto-card>. There's also Mono-Blue Spirits with <auto-card>Curious Obsession</auto-card> and <auto-card>Geistlight Snare</auto-card>, which crushed the Explorer rounds of <a href="https://www.magic.gg/events/magic-world-championship-xxviii" target="_blank">World Championship XXVIII</a>, but it has been seeing comparatively less play in Pioneer in recent weeks.</p>

<p>When playing against Bant Spirits, be wary of <auto-card>Spell Queller</auto-card> when they have three mana untapped or four mana for a <auto-card>Collected Company</auto-card>. Think twice before jamming your best spell on turn three into open mana. Likewise, remember that <auto-card>Rattlechains</auto-card> can counter your spot removal spells.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Gruul_Vehicles____889397f6-5719-4773-91e8-817baa7b22a5===

<p>Gruul Vehicles, at 3.5% of the record-weighted metagame, rose to prominence early in October. It's a novel midrange deck whose best draws use <auto-card>Llanowar Elves</auto-card> or <auto-card>Elvish Mystic</auto-card> to ramp into a turn-two <auto-card>Reckless Stormseeker</auto-card>. If you can grant haste to <auto-card>Esika's Chariot</auto-card>, a creature stolen by <auto-card>The Akroan War</auto-card>, or <auto-card>Skysovereign, Consul Flagship</auto-card>, then you'll be dominating the battlefield by turn three or four. <auto-card>The Akroan War</auto-card> is particularly potent against Green Devotion, and <auto-card>Skysovereign, Consul Flagship</auto-card> can singlehandedly defeat Rakdos Midrange.</p>

<p>When playing against this deck, keep a close eye on their companion after sideboard. If they don't reveal <auto-card>Jegantha, the Wellspring</auto-card>, then that generally means that they boarded in <auto-card>Embercleave</auto-card>, so watch out for that. Another interaction to be aware of is that with the third chapter of <auto-card>The Akroan War</auto-card> on the stack, they can tap the stolen creature to crew one of their vehicles.</p>

<p>From <i>The Brothers' War</i>, Obliterating Bolt should be a small upgrade over <auto-card>Lava Coil</auto-card>.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Abzan_Greasefang____5db1aea3-23ad-4c04-8347-1a7d3ddc606a===

<p>Abzan Greasefang, at 3.1% of the record-weighted metagame, is a combo deck with a decent midrange backup plan. The dream is to put <auto-card>Parhelion II</auto-card> into the graveyard on turn two and to crew it with <auto-card>Greasefang, Okiba Boss</auto-card> on turn three. The latest versions have mostly moved <auto-card>Witherbloom Command</auto-card> to the sideboard, instead favoring the duo of <auto-card>Stitcher's Supplier</auto-card> and <auto-card>Eldritch Evolution</auto-card> to increase consistency in the main deck. The archetype has been waxing and waning over the past months based on the popularity of <auto-card>Leyline of the Void</auto-card> and <auto-card>Karn, the Great Creator</auto-card> (which completely shuts down <auto-card>Parhelion II</auto-card>'s crew ability).</p>

<p>When playing against this deck, remember that the best time to kill Greasefang depends on the situation. If they have lots of spare creatures, then kill Gresefang in their main phase before it can trigger. If they have no other pilots, then kill it with the trigger on the stack so that <auto-card>Parhelion II</auto-card> returns to their hand. Also, if you board in <auto-card>Unlicensed Hearse</auto-card>, then consider leaving a 2-power creature untapped so you turn it into a creature in response to a <auto-card>Witherbloom Command</auto-card> that attempts to destroy it.</p>

<p>From <i>The Brothers' War</i>, <auto-card>Diabolic Intent</auto-card> may be an interesting option if you'd want more than four copies of <auto-card>Eldritch Evolution</auto-card>.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Dimir_Control____ce58b85f-d0bc-4a9d-9fd6-6fd47d6ad8e7===

<p>Dimir Control, at 2.8 of the winner's metagame, is a relatively new archetype on the competitive Pioneer stage, with no consensus build whatsoever. There's countermagic, removal, discard, planeswalkers, and card draw, but the precise cards differ a lot. <auto-card>Extinction Event</auto-card> is arguably better than <auto-card>Supreme Verdict</auto-card> in the current metagame because it can exile <auto-card>Old-Growth Troll</auto-card> and <auto-card>Cavalier of Thorns</auto-card>.</p>

<p>When playing against this deck, remember the static ability of <auto-card>Narset, Parter of Veils</auto-card>. Don't discard to <auto-card>Fable of the Mirror-Breaker</auto-card>, and try not to trigger <auto-card>Ledger Shredder</auto-card> on your own turn.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Rakdos_Sacrifice____1eb993a0-dcbc-43df-95bd-a80754dcb53a===

<p>Rakdos Sacrifice, at 2.8% of the winner's metagame, is based on the trio of <auto-card>Mayhem Devil</auto-card>, <auto-card>Cauldron Familiar</auto-card>, and <auto-card>Witch's Oven</auto-card>. Together, it creates a once-per-turn loop that drains your opponent, shoots two damage and lets you block for free. This combo appears in both Rakdos Sacrifice and Jund Sacrifice, but the two-color variant with the cleaner mana base has become more prominent.</p>

<p>When playing against this deck, kill <auto-card>Mayhem Devil</auto-card> on sight and be weary of the latest hotness: <auto-card>Kari Zev's Expertise</auto-card> alongside <auto-card>Village Rites</auto-card>. Not everyone has it, but it's a potent combo especially against <auto-card>Old-Growth Troll</auto-card> or <auto-card>Cavalier of Thorns</auto-card>. To mitigate the impact, keep multiple blockers untapped.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Selesnya_Angels____33967caf-5ed2-4199-8496-1eda2284fc88===

<p>Selesnya Angels, at 2.2% of the winner's metagame, is another tribal deck on the rise. Payoffs for focusing on the Angel tribe include <auto-card>Youthful Valkyrie</auto-card>, <auto-card>Bishop of Wings</auto-card>, and <auto-card>Giada, Font of Hope</auto-card>. <auto-card>Righteous Valkyrie</auto-card> and <auto-card>Resplendent Angel</auto-card> have the right creature type, and they love the life gain provided by <auto-card>Bishop of Wings</auto-card>.</p>

<p>From <i>The Brothers' War</i>, Brushland could be an upgrade for the mana base. Also, Kayla's Reconstruction is worse then <auto-card>Collected Company</auto-card> but still worth considering. For reference, in this deck with 12 two-drops and 15 three-drops, <auto-card>Collected Company</auto-card> would put 1.84 creatures with total mana value 5.0 on the battlefield in expectation, which is a gain of 1.0 mana. Kayla's Reconstruction for X=2 would put 1.91 creatures with total mana value 5.28 on the battlefield in expectation, which is a gain of 0.28 mana. Not great, not terrible.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Enigmatic_Incarnation____ce7e9e50-7e31-4d61-ab5c-abf4204aab72===

<p><auto-card>Enigmatic Incarnation</auto-card>, at 2.2% of the record-weighted metagame, has become a Pioneer mainstay ever since <i>Dominaria United</i> added <auto-card>Leyline Binding</auto-card>. The dream is to cast <auto-card>Leyline Binding</auto-card> on turn two or turn three, followed by <auto-card>Enigmatic Incarnation</auto-card> on turn four. This allows you to turn your six-mana enchantment into <auto-card>Titan of Industry</auto-card>, which will rule the battlefield on turn four.</p>

<p>When playing against this deck, you should generally try to win the game before they draw all colors of mana and deploy their key pieces. When given the chance, they will quickly take over the game with <auto-card>Fires of Invention</auto-card> and <auto-card>Yorion, Sky Nomad</auto-card> from the companion zone.</p>

<h1>Looking Ahead</h1>

<p>In the hands of experienced pilots, all archetypes shown above are capable of doing well at a Regional Championship or RCQ. There is something for everyone, whether you like aggro, midrange, control, ramp, or combo. And I haven't even gotten to some of the more fringe Pioneer archetypes!</p>

<p><i>The Brothers' War</i> will surely also have an impact on Pioneer. I already mentioned several cards while going over the top archetypes, but new archetypes may emerge as well. Brushland could herald the return of Selesnya Aura decks, and there are several enablers for wacky new combos. For example, Gwenna, Eyes of Gaea goes infinite in combination with <auto-card>Acererak the Archlich</auto-card> and <auto-card>Kinnan, Bonder Prodigy</auto-card>. The rewards for breaking the format with a spicy brew are huge, and many Regional Championship competitors will be trying their best. I'm looking forward to seeing everyone's innovations.</p>

<p>As a reminder, the first Regional Championship season will start this weekend with events in <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Tournament/View/12649" target="_blank">U.S.A</a>, <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Tournament/View/12521" target="_blank">Europe</a>, and <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Tournament/View/12349" target="_blank">Brazil</a>. By Sunday evening, nearly 100 players will have made the Pro Tour. I'll be vying for a slot myself, and I'm excited to see who will prove to be the best in their region. To follow along, don't miss the live streaming coverage from U.S.A. and Europe!</p>]]></description></item><item><title>The Week That Was: Regional Championships Rise</title><link>https://magic.gg/news/the-week-that-was-regional-championships-rise</link><guid>https://magic.gg/news/the-week-that-was-regional-championships-rise</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>The Pro Tour is back, and for thousands of competitors across the world the path there continues this weekend at a Regional Championship.</p>

<p>The Pro Tour champions of tomorrow are forged in the tournaments of today, and the path to competitive heights is clearer than it has been in some time. That's best exemplified by the reigning World Champion Nathan Steuer, a 20-year-old who has come from winning local tournaments to winning online tournaments to winning <i>Magic Online</i> Championships to winning <a href="https://magic.gg/news/the-week-that-was-the-greatest-steuer-ever-told" target="_blank">the World Championship at <i>Magic</i> 30 last month</a>.</p>

<p>As competitive play returns to tabletop, the stage is reset in a way almost never seen before in <i>Magic's</i> 30-year history of pro play. There are still plenty of legends in their own right playing the game at the highest levels, but there's no denying that the door is open more than ever before for someone to looking to make their mark on the rejuvenated competitive <i>Magic</i> scene.</p>

<p>For months, players have been hitting the tournament circuit, going from store to store to secure an invitation for the Regional Championship, and a six-week stretch of the best competitors <i>Magic</i> has to offer is about to begin across the globe. That begins with a four-continent kickoff this weekend as players across North and South America, Europe and Asia hit the ground running in our first Regional Championship weekend.</p>

<p>The full schedule looks like this:</p>

<h1>What's at Stake</h1>

<p>The last couple of years have been interesting, to say the least, when it comes to covering competitive <i>Magic</i>. From the introduction of <i>MTG Arena</i> to learning how to make coverage happen in a fully remote world, add in the rotation of the game's top players and teams in that time and you have a world where the previous things I took to be true no longer held up. Grand Prix Top 8s? Still a useful metric, except for the hundreds of players who have made their way up the competitive ranks entirely in a time of online play. <i>MTG Arena</i> lifetime win percentages? How useful is that when you're talking about a proven Hall of Famer?</p>

<p>Without the ins and outs of the weekly grind, fewer events have come to mean more. And even with that we've seen a consistent stream of the new best in the world demonstrate one part of <i>Magic</i> that has always been – and I suspect always will be – true.</p>

<p>One event can change a life.</p>

<p>That's what's on the line when we talk about the Regional Championships to follow, and those are the stories we'll be looking to tell. These aren't just one-off events that award a trophy and some cash – the top players from each Regional Championship will earn themselves an invitation to the first Pro Tour of 2023, taking place February 17-19, 2023 at <a href="https://mcphiladelphia.mtgfestivals.com/" target="_blank">MagicCon: Philadelphia</a>. For some future champion out there, their path to the top of the Pro Tour begins now. Not to mention that there's even more on the line here – some of the very best finishers will also punch their ticket to the next <i>Magic</i> World Championship.</p>

<h1>What to Watch For</h1>

<p>All of which means that for many players these are the biggest events to hit the tournament circuit in years. And at least one <a href="https://twitter.com/Mengu09/status/1591893862511173632" target="_blank">burgeoning chef</a> moonlighting as a <i>Magic</i> champion is treating the Regional Championship in Sofia, Bulgaria with all the attention it deserves.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">On my way to Sofia with <a href="https://twitter.com/PivoUlivo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@PivoUlivo</a> to join the rest of the testing house for the Regional Championship. Excited for this week! 🤩 🇧🇬 <a href="https://t.co/hTqSSWmcIB">pic.twitter.com/hTqSSWmcIB</a></p>&mdash; Andrea Mengucci (@Mengu09) <a href="https://twitter.com/Mengu09/status/1592133828541550593?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 14, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>With the return of the Pro Tour, it only makes sense that someone would resurrect the pro testing house. An age-old tradition that faced a pause during the pandemic is back at the Regional Championships courtesy of ringleader (and Mythic Invitational winner) Andrea Mengucci. Historically, Pro Tours would fall quickly after the release of the latest Standard set, and over the years the biggest teams figured out the best way to get ahead of the field was to lock themselves in a house with the best testing teammates they could find, emerging from seclusion two weeks later with the next format-breaking deck.</p>

<p>And plenty of that happened. But along the way, the testing house experience became more than just a data crunch: it was a rite of passage in the competitive <i>Magic</i> world, and the place where players made some of their most enduring memories whether the process yielded the next Caw-Blade or the tournament's worst deck.</p>

<p>So with the Regional Championship once again bringing together most of the best players across Europe, Mengucci joined forces with former World Champion Javier Dominguez and Portuguese legend Márcio Carvalho to bring things back in style.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/353LTOD4colHh1S48xVIxr/3b93a1fdf4d9f82da31c71aea97db157/281x225-2021-MPL-Andrea-Mengucci-Front.png" /><p class="embedImageCaption">Andrea Mengucci</p></div></div><br />

<p>"We wanted to live the old glory days again and treat this like a true Pro Tour," Mengucci explained. "We've had it. I was able to bring in new people, including my friends Marco del Pivo and Tian fa Mun, who have never lived this experience before and I knew could bring a lot to the team," he said. "Testing has been amazing; I love discovering new things. But walking 30 minutes in the wood in the rain in November wasn't as good!"</p>

<p>For the dozen or so members of the Sofia testing house, that memory will blend in with the hundreds of games of Pioneer they're playing right now, right in between Mono-Green Devotion and the latest serving of #MenguCuisine.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Baccalà con patate. A very traditional way to cook cod, reminds me of both my granmothers. 😊 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/menguccicuisine?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#menguccicuisine</a> 🇮🇹 <a href="https://t.co/Nuu07dqGdx">pic.twitter.com/Nuu07dqGdx</a></p>&mdash; Andrea Mengucci (@Mengu09) <a href="https://twitter.com/Mengu09/status/1591893862511173632?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 13, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>For Mengucci, it's all part of the experience. And as someone who has accomplished so much in <i>Magic</i> – he's won the World <i>Magic</i> Cup, the million-dollar Mythic Invitational, and posted seven Top Finishes in all – it's a return to the experience of the Pro Tour gathering that drives him in <i>Magic</i> right now. Since his incredible run that culminated in an Invitational victory, Mengucci has shifted his focus more to his true passion in <i>Magic</i>: content creation. His articles, "veedeos" and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/andreamengucci" target="_blank">Twitch stream</a> are can't-miss events every week, and he's maintained that success while remaining a world-class competitor at the same time. And with the Pro Tour on the horizon, the Italian is ready to tick a few more boxes off in his illustrious career.</p>

<p>"I hope to qualify for all of the Pro Tours in 2023, but really my true goal is to make it to the [<i>Magic</i>] Hall of Fame," he admitted. "I've been focusing more on work and less on competitive <i>Magic</i>, but I've been waiting for Wizards to bring it back after stopping nominations in 2019."</p>

<p>That motivation has led Mengucci to great heights before, and this weekend could be the first step toward the next milestone. One event can change the course of a career – or kickstart one to ever-greater heights. And with a new wave of players he's showing the ropes to, Mengucci is enjoying the ride.</p>

<h1>All Eyes on Atlanta, Sofia</h1>

<p>While the Regional Championships are the most visible event in years for every region's top players, the next six weeks will also be an extremely interesting stress test of Pioneer. The public consensus of those like Mengucci who are deep in testing for the event is a resulting… shrug.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I’m sure someone out there has a broken pioneer deck for the RCs and is just laughing at all of us who can’t find anything good</p>&mdash; Will Krueger (@Will__Krueger) <a href="https://twitter.com/Will__Krueger/status/1592890557269184513?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 16, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>That raises the stakes even higher for the first weekend of events, when players will square off across four countries and several Twitch broadcasts. It begins with Sofia, which will be streamed at <a href="https://www.Twitch.tv/legacyeuropeantour" target="_blank">Twitch.tv/legacyeuropeantour</a>. The commentators are Matej Zatlkaj, TheWillHallExp, Filipa Carola, and HarryMTG. Soon after, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/DreamHackMagic" target="_blank">coverage will begin in Atlanta</a>.</p>

<p>That's a lot of eyes on a relatively unexplored format still finding its footing. Mono-Green Devotion is undoubtedly the leader in the clubhouse but, by all accounts it's got some weaknesses that players will be aiming to exploit. And how things play out this first weekend is sure to impact things in the weeks ahead, as we look toward large Championship events in Canada and Japan, among others, next week. Looming over it all is the release of <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/products/the-brothers-war" target="_blank"><i>The Brothers War</i></a><i></i>, which is sure to throw a wrench into the format and send players inside testing houses across the world up the wall as they try get an edge on the competition.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Awake at 5.40 AM in the last day of testing for RC. Too many ideas and need much more practice. I feel unprepared this time.</p>&mdash; Andrea Mengucci (@Mengu09) <a href="https://twitter.com/Mengu09/status/1593087907258302465?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 17, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The more things change, the more they stay the same. And with the Pro Tour back and the Regional Championships kicking things off in earnest, I couldn't be more excited for it. And some things will never change, no matter how many thousands of games get played in testing houses.</p>

<p>While qualifiers for the second Regional Championships are underway, the very first Regional Championships are coming up in little over a week! More on that at the end of this article.</p>

<h1>Standard Metagame Snapshot</h1>

<p><a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/formats/standard" target="_blank">Standard</a> is a rotating format that currently allows expansion sets from <i>Innistrad: Midnight Hunt</i> forward.</p>

<p>To provide a metagame snapshot, I used all <a href="https://www.mtgo.com/en/mtgo/decklists" target="_blank"><i>Magic Online</i> decklists</a> from Standard Preliminary, Standard Qualifier, Standard Showcase Challenge, and Standard Challenge events held between October 19 and November 7. In addition, I used top decklists from <a href="https://magic.gg/events/magic-world-championship-xxviii" target="_blank"><i>Magic</i> World Championship XXVIII</a>, <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Tournament/View/12467" target="_blank">The Pizza Box: Standard Slice</a>, <a href="https://www.hareruyamtg.com/en/deck/result?pageSize=&amp;eventName=&amp;archetypeIds=&amp;dateFrom=2022%2F10%2F19&amp;dateTo=&amp;capacityFrom=&amp;capacityTo=&amp;card=&amp;player=&amp;eventName=%E3%80%90WPN+Premium+Store+Exclusive%E3%80%91Chanpions+Cup+Premium+Quarifier+in+Nagoya&amp;grades=grades&amp;public_status=private" target="_blank">Nagoya Premium RCQ</a>, and <a href="https://gamesquare.tw/game-deck-list.php?id=136" target="_blank">Castelo RCQ</a>. The majority of these tournaments took place after the <a href="https://magic.gg/decklists/magic-world-championship-xxviii-standard-decklists" target="_blank">World Championship decklists</a> were revealed.</p>

<p>By assigning to each deck a number of points equal to its number of match wins minus its number of match losses, I derived the following record-weighted metagame breakdown. It may be interpreted as a winner's metagame that you can expect to see at the top tables. Archetype names hyperlink to a well-performing decklist closest to the aggregate of the archetype.</p>

<p>The most-played nonland cards were <auto-card>Fable of the Mirror-Breaker</auto-card>, <auto-card>Reckoner Bankbuster</auto-card>, <auto-card>Make Disappear</auto-card>, and <auto-card>Cut Down</auto-card>.</p>

<p>Standard has been in a constant state of flux over the past month. At first, after <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/october-10-2022-banned-and-restricted-announcement" target="_blank">the ban</a> of <auto-card>The Meathook Massacre</auto-card> shook up the metagame, Esper Midrange emerged as the Deck to Beat. Indeed, Esper Midrange formed the majority of the <a href="https://magic.gg/decklists/october-2022-qualifier-weekend-day-2-4-win-decklists" target="_blank">4+ win decks from the October Qualifier Weekend</a> and the <a href="https://magic.gg/decklists/magic-world-championship-xxviii-standard-decklists" target="_blank">Standard decks submitted for <i>Magic</i> World Championship XXVIII</a>.</p>

<p>Yet the World Championship also showed that Esper Midrange could be beaten, as Izzet Tempo, Mono-Blue Tempo, and Grixis Midrange all posted positive records against it. We've been seeing more <auto-card>Haughty Djinn</auto-card> decks ever since, and Grixis Midrange has taken over both Jund Midrange and Esper Midrange.</p>

===decklistId:_Nathan Steuer_Magic World Championship XXVIII_10_28_2022_0f5087ce-a25e-4ad7-93f8-5e52a5144b15===

<p><a href="https://magic.gg/news/the-week-that-was-the-greatest-steuer-ever-told" target="_blank">Nathan Steuer</a> not only confirmed that he is the best <i>Magic</i> player in the world right now but also showed that Grixis Midrange was the best way to tackle the October Standard metagame. Relying on the power of <auto-card>Make Disappear</auto-card>, <auto-card>Fable of the Mirror-Breaker</auto-card>, and <auto-card>Invoke Despair</auto-card>, the deck has a small edge against Esper Midrange at the cost of a slightly worse matchup against the rest of the field.</p>

<p>While we saw Grixis Midrange, Esper Midrange, Mono-Blue Tempo, Jund Midrange, and Izzet Tempo at <a href="https://magic.gg/events/magic-world-championship-xxviii" target="_blank">the World Championship</a>, the sixth archetype in today's Standard breakdown is a fresh development.</p>

===decklistId:Esper_Legends_Jujubean__2004___b1e82d61-a1e0-4f3b-b703-148cf060e0be===

<p>Esper Legends is fueled by <auto-card>Plaza of Heroes</auto-card>; <auto-card>Thalia, Guardian of Thraben</auto-card>; and <auto-card>Otawara, Soaring City</auto-card>. These cards enable a completely different take on the color combination. The list shown above has zero noncreature spells to maximize Thalia and a whopping 29 lands to support large numbers of legendary lands.</p>

<p>With enough legendary creatures to reduce the channel cost, <auto-card>Otawara, Soaring City</auto-card> effectively turns into an Island/<auto-card>Unsummon</auto-card> split card, which is worth running four copies of. As always, the lands reveal what is possible in any format, and the deck building possibilities enabled by these legendary lands are still getting explored.</p>

<p>The importance of lands is worth bearing in mind as <i>The Brothers' War</i> enters the format. The new set releases online on Tuesday November 15 and worldwide on Friday November 18. For Standard, I expect that the most important additions will be the nonbasic lands.</p>

<p><auto-card>Brushland</auto-card>, <auto-card>Llanowar Wastes</auto-card>, <auto-card>Underground River</auto-card>, and <auto-card>Battlefield Forge</auto-card> will improve the mana bases of various multicolor decks. <auto-card>Battlefield Forge</auto-card> and <auto-card>Brushland</auto-card> may single-handedly enable Boros Aggro and Selesnya Aggro as viable options. In addition, Fortified Beachhead will enable a white-blue Soldiers archetype, and Mishra's Foundry will boost all kinds of mono-color decks.</p>

<p>The set introduces many powerful spells as well, of course. In particular, the dream of melding Urza, Lord Protector; Mishra, Claimed by Gix; or Titania, Voice of Gaea should get your brewing gears turning. But in the end, mana bases form the foundation of a format, and the consistency at which you can cast your spells or use your mana is the main driver of a deck's competitive viability. Since <i>The Brothers' War</i> introduced many powerful nonbasic lands, I think it will have a large impact on the format, and it'll be exciting to see how Standard will develop.</p>

<p>The most-played nonland cards were <auto-card>Fatal Push</auto-card>, <auto-card>Thoughtseize</auto-card>, and <auto-card>Fable of the Mirror-Breaker</auto-card>.</p>

<p>In the table, I've added up and down arrows to signify the biggest changes compared to <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/metagame-mentor-pioneer-metagame-roundup-october-2022" target="_blank">last month's Pioneer metagame roundup</a>. As you can see, Izzet Phoenix has been on the rise, whereas Rakdos Midrange and Abzan Greasefang took a plunge.</p>

<p>Yet the biggest news is the re-emergence of two archetypes: Keruga Fires and Dimir Control. They were not a significant part of last month's competitive metagame, but they have risen up in the ranks in recent weeks. If you plan to compete in an upcoming Pioneer event, then it's useful to be aware of these decks.</p>

===decklistId:Keruga_Fires_Pancake_Sock___3f411cf7-c0b4-4553-9f84-a3c87b351291===

<p>Keruga Fires is built around <auto-card>Keruga, the Macrosage</auto-card> and <auto-card>Fires of Invention</auto-card>. <auto-card>Fires of Invention</auto-card> essentially doubles up your mana while allowing you to spend your lands on <auto-card>Kenrith, the Returned King</auto-card>'s activated abilities. <auto-card>Keruga, the Macrosage</auto-card> comes with a substantial companion restriction, but it can create massive card advantage, especially when you control <auto-card>Fires of Invention</auto-card>.</p>

<p>After <i>Dominaria United</i> introduced <auto-card>Temporary Lockdown</auto-card> and <auto-card>Leyline Binding</auto-card>, many players were excited to try these enchantments in <auto-card>Enigmatic Incarnation</auto-card> shells. It took a while for deck builders to catch on to their synergy with <auto-card>Keruga, the Macrosage</auto-card>, but based on recent results, the archetype has legs.</p>

===decklistId:Dimir_Control_Gabriel_Nassif___e024a23c-2830-4d37-a282-d2bdfc29f580===

<p>Hall of Famer Gabriel Nassif started a trend by brewing a Dimir Control deck with <auto-card>Narset, Parter of Veils</auto-card>. Besides a singleton <auto-card>Ertai Resurrected</auto-card>, there aren't any notable gains from <i>Dominaria United</i>, but the color pair has always had a good combination of countermagic, discard, spot removal, card draw. Pioneer even offers <auto-card>Extinction Event</auto-card> as a sweeper.</p>

<p><i>The Brothers' War</i> will surely also have an impact on Pioneer. Besides the lands—<auto-card>Brushland</auto-card> in particular could improve the mana base of Selesnya Aura decks—the set offers various new toolbox artifacts for <auto-card>Karn, the Great Creator</auto-card>. For example, Cityscape Leveler, Haywire Mite, The Stone Brain, Woodcaller Automaton, and The Stasis Coffin. Green Devotion remains on top of the format, and it can only get better.</p>

<p>Another interesting new option is <auto-card>Diabolic Intent</auto-card>, which could enable combos in sacrifice-themed decks. Speaking of combos, how about <auto-card>Phyrexian Portal</auto-card> in a <auto-card>Refurbish</auto-card> deck? Arcane Proxy to copy <auto-card>See the Truth</auto-card>? Gwenna, Eyes of Gaea to go infinite with <auto-card>Acererak the Archlich</auto-card> and <auto-card>Kinnan, Bonder Prodigy</auto-card>? <auto-card>Fauna Shaman</auto-card> in a <auto-card>Prized Amalgam</auto-card> deck? Yotian Dissident in <auto-card>Hardened Scales</auto-card>? There are options aplenty, and with the first Regional Championships fast approaching, the rewards for breaking the format with a spicy brew can be enormous.</p>

<h1>Modern Metagame Snapshot</h1>

<p><a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/formats/modern" target="_blank">Modern</a> is a nonrotating format based on expansion sets, core sets, and Modern Horizons sets from <i>Eight Edition</i> forward.</p>

<p>To provide a metagame snapshot, I used all <a href="https://www.mtgo.com/en/mtgo/decklists" target="_blank"><i>Magic Online</i> decklists</a> from Modern Preliminary and Modern Challenge events held between October 19 and November 7. In addition, I used top decklists from the <a href="https://events.axionnow.co.uk/Information/GIGAModTop8Oct22" target="_blank">GIGA Modern at Axion Now's The Gathering</a>, <a href="https://www.aarebogemagic.ch/2022/10/28/swiss-magic-masters-2022/" target="_blank">Swiss <i>Magic</i> Masters 2022</a>, <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Tournament/View/11716" target="_blank">NRG Series $5K Trial Newark</a>, and <a href="https://www.magic.gg/news/metagame-mentor-modern-decks-for-the-magic-30-beta-draft" target="_blank"><i>Magic</i> 30 Beta Draft Championship</a>.</p>

<p>The most-played nonland cards were <auto-card>Lightning Bolt</auto-card>; <auto-card>Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer</auto-card>; and <auto-card>Expressive Iteration</auto-card>.</p>

<p>The metagame has not seen major upheavals after <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/october-10-2022-banned-and-restricted-announcement" target="_blank">the ban</a> of <auto-card>Yorion, Sky Nomad</auto-card>. Izzet Murktide put up several good finishes over the past few weeks, and Four-Color Omnath players have embraced different companions.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Izzet_Murktide____f8c59b99-0803-47f9-8133-82eb49852585===

<p>Izzet Murktide remains a good deck choice in Modern, with game against the field. It combines cheap cantrips, efficient interactive spells, and the best one- or two-mana threats in the Izzet colors to quickly overpower everyone.</p>

<p>The main development is that most lists have started to run <auto-card>Blood Moon</auto-card> over <auto-card>Archmage's Charm</auto-card>. Four-color decks like <auto-card>Indomitable Creativity</auto-card> are weak to <auto-card>Blood Moon</auto-card>, and <auto-card>Abundant Growth</auto-card> has been disappearing after the Yorion ban. As a result, <auto-card>Blood Moon</auto-card> is well-positioned right now, and you should keep it in mind when deciding which lands to fetch.</p>

===decklistId:Aggregate_Four-Color_Omnath____57d6c558-7dd1-48af-b932-2710e79246ed===

<p><auto-card>Omnath, Locus of Creation</auto-card> remains exceptionally powerful when combined with fetch lands, and companions other than <auto-card>Yorion, Sky Nomad</auto-card> are viable as well. Four-Color Omnath players have been trying out <auto-card>Kaheera, the Orphanguard</auto-card> and <auto-card>Keruga, the Macrosage</auto-card>, and while there is no consensus yet, Kaheera builds have put up the best numbers so far.</p>

<p>Compared to the 80-card lists of yore, typical cuts have been <auto-card>Ice-Fang Coatl</auto-card>, <auto-card>Abundant Growth</auto-card>, and the <auto-card>Traverse the Ulvenwald</auto-card> package. The aggregate list over the past few weeks is more controlling, featuring spells like <auto-card>Teferi, Hero of Dominaria</auto-card> and <auto-card>Leyline Binding</auto-card>. But given that there are so many different builds going around, this probably isn't even the deck's final form yet.</p>

<p>Modern is a large format, so new expansion sets are unlikely to cause enormous changes. However, Third Path Iconoclast has my attention. <auto-card>Young Pyromancer</auto-card> nearly won <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptrix" target="_blank">a Modern Pro Tour in 2018</a>, and this new variant can be triggered via <auto-card>Mishra's Bauble</auto-card> or <auto-card>Mox Amber</auto-card>. Moreover, it produces artifacts, which boosts your <auto-card>Urza's Saga</auto-card> tokens and helps cast <auto-card>Thought Monitor</auto-card>. In an artifact-centric go-wide brew, Third Path Iconoclast could easily make a Modern impact.</p>

<p>Another thing that is always worth doing when evaluating new sets for Modern is to look for one-mana cards with unique effects, as they might be worth including in decks with <auto-card>Urza's Saga</auto-card> or <auto-card>Chord of Calling</auto-card>. From <i>The Brothers' War</i>, Haywire Mite stands out as an interactive option.</p>

<h1>Looking Ahead</h1>

<p>This weekend, November 11-13, highlights include the Black Lotus Prerelease at the <a href="https://mtgsummit.com/" target="_blank"><i>Magic</i> Summit</a> and the $30K Pioneer tournament at <a href="https://scgcon.starcitygames.com/event/scg-con-philadelphia-2022-2/" target="_blank">SCG CON Philadelphia</a>.</p>

<p>"<i>Magic</i> is many different things to many different people."</p>

<p>That's a phrase I've worn out over the last decade but I've found that not only is it true, it's more true than ever before. Over 30 years of evolution in <i>Magic</i>, the tent has always expanded to welcome in more ways to play the game, more places to play the game, and more people to play the game with.</p>

<p>But even that doesn't do it justice. Because <i>Magic</i> is more than a game. It always has been. It's always been The Gathering, and over time that tent has expanded from Type 1.5 and Type 2 in 2002 all the way to <i>Magic</i> 30 in Las Vegas a few weeks ago, where many of the people in the room were content to play no tournaments at all – they were there to share their love of all things <i>Magic</i>, far beyond the limits of sixties and sideboards.</p>

<p>That much was evident as soon as you walked into the convention hall. Because this wasn't a <i>Magic</i> tournament; even though <a href="https://magic.gg/events/magic-world-championship-xxviii" target="_blank"><i>Magic</i> World Championship XXVIII</a> happened (<a href="https://magic.gg/news/the-week-that-was-the-greatest-steuer-ever-told" target="_blank">and crowned Nathan Steuer its champion</a>), <i>Magic</i> 30 was a celebration of all things <i>Magic</i>, past, present and future. The World Championship was next to a live Commander show, which was the prelude to a packed house for an interview with Richard Garfield himself, which then led into panels about the lore behind the game and the finer details of life on Dominaria.</p>

<p><i>Magic</i> has been many things to many people over the past 30 years. But one thing has been constant: it's always been about the people, not the <i>Magic</i>. And today I want to recognize a few of them who made <i>Magic</i> 30 the spectacle it was, building on the work done by the people who have shaped <i>Magic</i> into the gathering it is today.</p>

<p>Meet Evan Braun. Perhaps better known as <a href="https://twitter.com/DarkPactCosplay" target="_blank">DarkPactCosplay,</a> or as <auto-card>Ashiok, Nightmare Weaver</auto-card>, or as the Milwaukee native who helped to grow <i>Magic</i> in their hometown by putting together free get-togethers for newer players.</p>

<p>Or, as they're known after <i>Magic</i> 30, the winner of best-in-show at <i>Magic</i>'s first large-scale cosplay competition.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Your phobias and doubts have aged like a fine wine, hidden beneath a veneer of resolve. I am here to crack open the bottle. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MagicTheGathering?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MagicTheGathering</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MTG?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MTG</a> <a href="https://t.co/QStLDLPEfN">pic.twitter.com/QStLDLPEfN</a></p>&mdash; Dark Pact Cфsplay, Nightmare&#39;s Muse (he/they) (@DarkPactCosplay) <a href="https://twitter.com/DarkPactCosplay/status/1589710287959363585?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 7, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>"I've been cosplaying since 2017 when my local store in Milwaukee, Open Shield Tavern, did a small cosplay competition. I was immediately hooked by the community of people I met," he recalled. "I loved it. Ever since that night, I've been going to conventions like GenCon and cosplaying."</p>

<p>They've created some amazing cosplays in that time. From the first character Braun worked on for an impromptu cosplay at the LGS, his theater background, ingenuity and more than anything his perseverance has led to some incredible moments.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Since I have so many new followers, I want to introduce myself! I am Dark Pact Cosplay, your local cosplay cult leader. With your devotion and worship, I forge dark and terrible costumes and props from my favorite pieces of fiction. Links to all socials are in my bio! <a href="https://t.co/M83gWNzNs4">pic.twitter.com/M83gWNzNs4</a></p>&mdash; Dark Pact Cфsplay, Nightmare&#39;s Muse (he/they) (@DarkPactCosplay) <a href="https://twitter.com/DarkPactCosplay/status/1587151507358629889?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 31, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>When <i>Magic</i> 30 was announced with a cosplay competition, Braun knew he wanted to be there. But cross-country trips aren't always in the budget–especially when trying to create and travel with large pieces of cosplay apparel–and Braun was resigned to missing the opportunity.</p>

<p>"Then I found out about the <a href="https://magic.gg/news/magiccon-philadelphia-new-perspectives-grant-program" target="_blank">New Perspectives Grant Program</a>, so I applied for that and shared my experience with setting up game nights at the pub for new players," he explained. "I ended up receiving it, which was just wild–never in a million years would I have been able to go if not for that. I'm so thankful for them giving me and the other nine amazing individuals the opportunity."</p>

<p>And Braun made the most of it. They spent weeks planning and preparing the cosplay, and then a furious two weeks before the event making sure everything was ready to go ("con-crunch" was a new term I learned from Braun this week! I'm sure fellow cosplayers can relate).</p>

<p>"I've been playing since <i>Born of the Gods</i>, ever since I first got the intro deck with <auto-card>Eater of Hope</auto-card> on the front," he explained. "I played Standard for a while, and I began watching creators like the Professor and the Command Zone that kept me in the game. Now I'm at <i>Magic</i> 30 getting to meet people I've looked up to for years. I was so star-struck, but amazing, established cosplayers like <a href="https://twitter.com/goberthicks" target="_blank">Olivia Gobert-Hicks</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/TappyToeClaws" target="_blank">Tappy Toe Claws</a> were backstage talking me up the entire time. To have people like that who I've looked up to for years be so nice and wonderful, I was so overwhelmed by how nice and welcoming the community is. I made so many new friends; the overall vibe in the community is amazing and I will always remember that above anything else."</p>

<p>Of course, there was plenty of <i>Magic played</i> at <i>Magic</i> 30 as well, including one format that those of us who weren't around for drafts in 1993 have never experienced: the <i>Beta</i> draft.</p>

<p>It was a fitting way to celebrate <i>Magic</i>'s 25th anniversary (we even did a <i>Beta</i> draft at the Pro Tour), and as unopened <i>Beta</i> packs become ever rarer, it was a headline event at <i>Magic</i> 30 as well. Tournaments throughout the convention fed into the Top 8 draft, and large crowds gathered around to watch players crack packs that had been sealed for longer than some of them had been alive. And while I can't say much about the gameplay – it turns out Wizards has learned a <i>lot</i> about draft formats in the past three decades – it's undeniably cool to watch players break out the gloves and sleeves and crack some of the packs that started it all.</p>

<p>"The <i>Beta</i> draft was just about the only reason I made the trip," he explained. "Large conventions aren't really my thing, but I planned on playing multiple qualifiers for the draft."</p>

<p>It only took Hinkle, a 22-year veteran of the game and former Pro Tour competitor with two Grand Prix Top 8s to his name, one qualifier to get there.</p>

<p>"I hadn't done a serious Rochester draft since I don't know when, so that was a nice nostalgia trip and everyone's reaction to the number of basics in packs was pretty entertaining too," he said of the draft. "I was the lucky one whose pack contained a <auto-card>Time Walk</auto-card> in the second pack opened, and to top it off I got to draft a deck full of X spells so it was a ton of fun to play. As far as winning, it was a major rush. It was by far my most successful finish in the 20+ years I've been playing <i>Magic</i>."</p>

<p>Two <i>Magic</i> 30 stories with two very different motivations, bound together by the magic of the gathering. That's what the celebration of Magic's 30 years was, all set to the backdrop of the World Championship and the rich history of the Pro Tour. And like those who came before them, Braun and Hinkle and Steuer are adding their own chapters to <i>Magic</i>.</p>

<p>There's room enough for everyone in this gathering—and it's "the gathering" that helps us remember.</p>

<p><i>(Note: Kazuyuki Takimura remembrance provided by Wizards of the Coast.)</i></p>

<p>With the return of the Pro Tour at <a href="https://magic.gg/news/magiccon-philadelphia-and-the-2023-magiccon-schedule" target="_blank">MagicCon Philadelphia</a>, gatherings grow once more with the best tabletop <i>Magic</i> players in the world meeting—and battling—to become the next champion. From across the world, connections form that reach beyond the tournaments as friendships are forged.</p>

<p>Recently, one of Japan's greatest players passed. Kazuyuki Takimura may be renowned for winning Pro Tour <i>Battle for Zendikar</i> in 2015 but his accomplishments extend far deeper into the Japanese <i>Magic</i> community.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/6xzttWHCTUHXdbBNj1DYMk/211681fae69c1bf17cb6f5a1eb148593/1920x1280-Kazuyuki-Takimura-Pro-Tour-BFZ-Winner-Trophy.jpg" /><p class="embedImageCaption">Kazuyuki Takimura, winner Pro Tour Battle for Zendikar</p></div></div><br />

<p>In addition to his five Grand Prix Top 8, including at win at Grand Prix Kyoto 2016 with teammates Yuki Matsumoto and Yuuki Ichikawa, Takimura shared his skill and helped build Team Kusemono for the Pro Tour Team series—packed with some of Japan's greats. That team continued on into online play and ushered to the stage more strong players, such as Riku Kumagai, that continue the excellence Takimura exemplified.</p>

<p><i>(Note: Remembering Mort provided by Brian David-Marshall.)</i></p>

<p>The <i>Magic</i> coverage family lost someone very dear to us recently. The name John "Mort" Mortensen might not be well known to even the most die-hard follower of Pro Tour coverage over the years, but if you followed any cable from any camera, microphone or steady-cam to the backstage area they would all lead to Mort's chair. He was the person—along with his hand-picked, amazingly talented Think-a-Tron team—that made it all work. And to be clear: Mort was at the vanguard of streaming game play long before the term "esports" was ever coined.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/31ClbjEBLOK4SviYln4gXQ/7d8140c36ba5cc13da3ad11525ea04cb/1024x1365-Mort-Think-A-Tron-Chair.jpg" style="width: 450px;" /></div></div><br />

<p>When I arrived on the coverage scene Mort was already there. An irascible curmudgeon who made it possible to watch some of the greatest moments in the history of <i>Magic</i> and not just read about them. And he continually pushed the envelope on what was possible. What started out as downloadable video files on the Wizards website grew up to become embedded YouTube links. Text articles about how a deck worked became an on camera discussion with the deck's designers from the floor of the event. And eventually those short videos and Top 8 coverage became live streams with multiple studios that ran from before Round One until the winner's interview.</p>

<p>Someone who worked closely with Mort and his team throughout a lot of that evolution was Wizards of the Coast Play Studio member Mike Rosenberg.</p>

<p>"Mort was more than a technical director for <i>Magic</i> coverage in all of its iterations from era to era of tournament systems. He was instrumental in the development of the news desk as we moved to the live broadcasting medium back in 2012, and over the years continued to find ways to evolve the approach to covering Swiss-style tournaments with multiple rounds each day over each iteration of the <i>Magic</i> Pro Tour's coverage," Rosenberg shared. "One such innovation was with equipment to detail clearer, legible board states and to allow for zoom to see and even read <i>Magic</i> cards present on a table from the overhead. This technical concept was put into full effect during Pro Tour 25th Anniversary when broadcasting the <i>Magic: The Gathering</i> Beta Rochester Draft live and, later, in various feature matches and events beyond that, zooming in on complex board states to break down the sheer number of creatures and other cards present and active in a game."</p>

<p>In addition to being at the cutting edge with his technical direction, Mort had an entire other side of him touring the world as a musician with his band The Mono Men, a hugely influential act that grew out of the Pacific Northwest punk and grunge scenes. He was often flying off from Pro Tours in one far-flung location to some other corner of the globe to tour with his band for throngs of adoring fans. He was a rock star in all senses of the word—but he never acted like one.</p>

<p><i>Magic: The Gathering</i> Hall of Famer Randy Buehler was someone who, as a commentator in the booth, worked with Mort throughout his career in coverage.</p>

<p>"His secret history as a grunge musician was not something he ever brought up, but totally made sense to me when I learned about it. I still can't believe he's gone," Buehler said.</p>

<p>Mort was punk in the absolute best sense of that word. He did not suffer fools gladly, he would always figure out how to cut through the bullshit (I am owed one curse word from my time on coverage and I will cash it in here) and get stuff done, and ultimately his gruff exterior contained a deep well of friendship, loyalty, and creativity. And if you were a member of the coverage team putting yourself out there you could have no better champion on your side, even if behind the scenes you strained his patience just a little bit.</p>

<p>Pro Tour commentator, and host of the Limited Resources podcast, Marshall Sutcliffe recounted one of his first times working with Mort.</p>

<p>"I remember doing one of my first shows with him, and he was so nice and encouraging and made sure I was comfortable on air," Marshall explained. "But then he forgot to switch his mic off and cursed about me moving or looking at the wrong camera or something, but he didn't know I could hear it. Then he came back on with me and was super nice and encouraging. It was so funny because it gave me a glimpse of all the crap he was dealing with me being new and not really getting it yet, but he never let me know, at least not on purpose. I told him that I had heard what he said and we both laughed about it after. I'll miss him."</p>

<p>Someone else Mort worked closely with was Deb Slater. Deb was his right hand on the Pro Tour and a dear friend to him away from it. She has organized a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/in-memory-of-mort" target="_blank">GoFundMe</a> for Mort's daughters and her words about Mort's crowning achievement in a storied career are a perfect note to end this memorial with.</p>

<p>"John will be remembered as an esteemed trailblazer in his professional field of video production, a rock star in the music world and an amazing friend," Slater shared. "But the most important role to him was as a loving father of his two daughters, Madeline and Annabelle."</p>

<p>SCG events began in 2009 with tight event halls and tighter budgets as they sought to recreate the success previously seen only by the Wizards-sponsored Grand Prix circuit. It was a bold endeavor in a period of economic uncertainty, and it was a risk that they took in the name of growing the game. The first advertised SCG Open was in April at SCG's home in Roanoke, Virginia, and the prize pool was $1,000.</p>

<p>Things have changed quite a bit since then.</p>

<p>For starters, the SCG circuit—now known as SCG CON—is the largest and most well-known in North America. It has been the home for the rise of now-household <i>Magic</i> names. Frankly, there's way too many players here to highlight without leaving out someone I should name, so instead I'll just share the story of one player who lived the promise the SCG circuit offered at a time when there were few other options.</p>

<p>Brian Braun-Duin was a Friday Night <i>Magic</i> kind of player when he began. Like many of you reading this, he eventually dipped his toes into the next step—a PTQ in his area. When the SCG series came around, he gave it a shot.</p>

<p>It didn't go great for him. He lost, sometimes a lot. It was at times a harsh reminder that there were levels in competitive <i>Magic</i>, and he had a long way to go; not everyone is born into the game a <i>Magic</i> prodigy like many of those whose names have graced Pro Tour Top 8s at a young age.</p>

<p>But it was the perfect steppingstone experience for someone looking to level up their game, and BBD kept at it. He was the quintessential SCG grinder, traveling across the country with the circuit and battling week in and week out in a way that tested skills that even the Pro Tour didn't necessarily test. It was a long journey for Braun-Duin, and he documented it extensively in weekly writing as he shared his sometimes-harrowing tales of the work it took to truly improve, even if it was often a tumultuous trajectory.</p>

<p>But improve he did. A lot. And he rose to the top of the SCG ranks. Then the Pro Tour ranks. Then, in 2016, Brian Braun-Duin won the <i>Magic</i> World Championship.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/7g7f8en5rSDbAcr6Gz2uqQ/58b7fa44322abeaab28d9a55da5a9617/BBD-2016wc-trophy_1_.jpg" /><p class="embedImageCaption">Brian Braun-Duin, 2016 Magic World Champion</p></div></div><br />

<p>That's the pedigree the SCG circuit brings to every event—the knowledge every entrant has that <i>Magic</i> stars were forged in these battlefields, and that you're just as likely to play against a well-known pro or content creator as you are your friend who made the car ride with you to the event. It's a cachet that has only grown over the years, because while BBD may be the best example of the benefits of playing these tournaments, he's far—<i>far</i>—from the only one-day Pro Tour Top 8 member or winner who got their start on the SCG streets.</p>

<p>Which brings us to today, SCG CON Columbus and Brady Munroe.</p>

<h1>Munroe's Modern Mastery</h1>

<p>As the return of tabletop <i>Magic</i> events has played out, SCG CON has played a key role for North American competitors, and a few weeks ago in Columbus that meant a full trio of high-stakes Modern tournaments. Large prize pools and Modern means a selection of the game's best will turn out to compete, and Columbus was no exception. Pro Tour competitor (when he's not busy being entertaining as heck in the commentary booth) Corey Baumeister was one of several accomplished players to add another big finish to their resume along with Pete Ingram and Ross Merriam, all of whom were piloting a version of the <auto-card>Underworld Breach</auto-card> combo deck that <a href="https://magic.gg/news/the-week-that-was-the-very-model-of-a-modern-major-series" target="_blank">Jesse Robkin took the finals using at an NRG Open</a> a few weeks earlier.</p>

<magic-cards>
  Underworld Breach
</magic-cards>

<p>Those are players you may have heard of. They have long resumes and Top 8s in more cities than they can remember. But like I said, the biggest draw of these events to me is the newer players following in the footsteps of the many who came before them.</p>

<p>That's where Munroe comes in. His passion for card games was sparked as a child, and he grew up playing <i>Yu-Gi-Oh!</i> with friends at his local game store, Alternate Universes. When <i>Magic</i> eventually made its way into his life back in 2019, he was ecstatic to find out there was a path toward high-stakes tournaments and a dream he could watch come true for someone at the Pro Tour every few months. Like BBD before him, Munroe's own ascent had begun.</p>

<p>Three years later, he's a champion. Munroe won the massive $20,000 Modern tournament in Columbus, and his story is proof that the role the SCG circuit has served players for almost fifteen years is still going strong.</p>

<p>"The first set I drafted was <i>Rivals of Ixalan</i>—I already had a big competitive drive from playing <i>Yu-Gi-Oh!</i> for many years, so I was equally interested in playing <i>Magic</i> tournaments with higher and higher stakes," Munroe recalled. "That summer, I made Top 8 at a modern PPTQ, and in fall of 2019 I finished second in a <i>Magic Online</i> Modern challenge. A few more Top 8s and together this progression solidified the idea to myself that I was good at Constructed."</p>

<p>All of which came just in time for competitive <i>Magic</i> play to move to online venues, and as the landscape around the game changed, Munroe continually adapted. He served as the president of the <i>Magic</i> club at Carnegie Mellon University—an institution that was the home to future <i>Pro Tour</i> Hall of Famers and champions in <i>Magic</i>'s early competitive days.</p>

<p>When in-person events began to return earlier this year, Munroe saw a renewed opportunity to live out those <i>Magic</i> dreams delayed and jumped right in.</p>

<p>"The majority of larger events that I have traveled to in the past couple of years have been SCG events," he explained. "And I am glad that they host these conventions, because one of the best parts of <i>Magic</i> is the gathering—the ability to see a bunch of friends and meet new cool people, and hang out for an entire weekend is amazing. I've been actively looking for various Constructed tournaments to play in, both local weekend 1-2ks, and reasonably drivable larger events such as the SCG CON event and the Legacy Pit Open."</p>

<p>Munroe was looking for a new weapon of choice in Modern for Columbus, and as he drifted in and out of Izzet Murktide and tried out various flavors of Modern combo, he flashed back to a deck he had enjoyed in the past.</p>

<p>"I knew that I really enjoyed playing artifact prison decks, so I decided to try out prison Tron; the third Modern deck I played ever was UG/UR Whir of Invention Prison, which helped me fall in love with artifacts and <auto-card>Ensnaring Bridge</auto-card> in particular," Munroe explained. "Then when <auto-card>Oko, Thief of Crowns</auto-card> came out that fall, the deck became significantly worse, so I switched over to the Urza/Emry/Jeskai Ascendancy combo deck until <auto-card>Mox Opal</auto-card> was banned), which so far is my favorite Modern deck that I have played."</p>

<magic-cards config="fan">
  Karn, the Great Creator
  Ensnaring Bridge
  Mystic Forge
  Chalice of the Void
</magic-cards>

<p>"So, to specifically prepare for this tournament, I used various lists posted on MTGGoldfish as well as some of the sentiments shared by other Prison Tron players from the artifact prison Discord. Pretty soon before the event, I decided that I wanted to play a copy of <auto-card>Warping Wail</auto-card>, which I was thankfully able to borrow from my carmate Brian Coval."</p>

<p>It worked, <auto-card>Warping Wail</auto-card> and all. Munroe finished third after the Swiss rounds, and after a tight three-game match against Five-Color Indomitable Creativity in the quarterfinals, Munroe posted back-to-back 2-0 victories to take the title.</p>

===decklistId:Prison_Tron_Brady_Munroe___3cd4172d-a9bb-478e-a0f7-21c058a35a17===

<p>With his best finish to date now under his belt, Munroe is looking toward the future and the Pro Tour he can now reach—and he aspires to add his name to the list of greats who got started with a Top 8 SCG run.</p>

This was, after all, the biggest match of his life and the one that would define his future as a competitive <i>Magic</i> player, and coming against one of the best players in the room. This was a moment where champions were made, stars rising to the occasion or falling to the wayside in their pursuit of the <i>Magic</i> World Championship.</p>

<p>So with barely contained nerves, Steuer sweated every draw step as if it were his last. Agonized over every decision, every attack or block. Played like everything was on the line, like he was at the World Championship and playing against a Hall of Famer like Reid Duke.</p>

<p>The year was 2015, and young Nathan Steuer was playing in his first-ever Grand Prix Day Two.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/6taCpZS4HHxMU3VobJqnql/8bd3b355d7d6968639d79e65b8cd5c46/1920x1280-Nathan-Steuer-Day-2-Grand-Prix-San-Diego-2015.jpg" /><p class="embedImageCaption">Nathan Steuer, Day 2 Grand Prix San Diego 2015</p></div></div><br />

<p>And while he may have only been at the World Championship in his mind, he <i>was</i> playing against Hall of Famer Reid Duke.</p>

<p>"That's what I remember most about [Grand Prix San Diego 2015], getting a feature match and then beating Reid for the best finish of my career," Steuer recalled. "That was the first time I remember feeling like I could beat a really good player.</p>

<p>"Now I'm playing next to him at the World Championship."</p>

<p>It's been quite the journey for the <a href="https://magic.gg/events/magic-world-championship-xxviii" target="_blank"><i>Magic</i> World Championship XXVIII</a> winner.</p>

<p>Steuer first picked up <i>Magic</i> at summer camp in 2010 and rose through the ranks of competitive play. Soon he was playing six or seven days a week at his local game store, and it wasn't long before Grands Prix, <i>Magic Online</i>,<i></i> and <i>MTG Arena</i> play followed.</p>

<p>Steuer is the rare case of a "prodigy" who not just lived up to expectations but blew past all of them–including his own. Even at that first Grand Prix Day Two against Duke all those years ago Steuer was pegged among the next generation of elite <i>Magic</i> players, and he took that to heart. He sought out guidance from those better than him, he practiced with other up-and-coming players in his area, and all along he nurtured a dream that snuck into his mind in those tense moments against one of his <i>Magic</i> idols in Duke.</p>

<p>That formative experience was fresh in his mind during the closing rounds of <i>Magic</i> World Championship XXVIII, when he faced down Hall of Famers, seasoned World Championship competitors, and opponents of the highest caliber in every round.</p>

<p>"The World Championship was as mentally taxing as it was anything else," Steuer said, introspective in the days following his incredible run from the lower bracket to <a href="https://magic.gg/news/title-match-of-magic-world-championship-xxviii" target="_blank">defeat Eli Kassis in the finals</a>. "Every round was such an intense experience, and it was a battle. It feels incredible to have gone through all of that and to have won ... it's an actual dream or fantasy, even, that I've had since I started playing and discovered I could qualify for the Pro Tour."</p>

<p>For 12 years those who know Steuer best watched him give everything he had to <i>Magic</i>. And at the World Championship, with all its bells and whistles on display, they finally had the opportunity to watch the game give something back: the fulfilment of a dream that's occupied more than half of Steuer's life.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">My nephew <a href="https://twitter.com/Nathansteuer1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Nathansteuer1</a> is KICKING BUTT at the Magic:The Gathering world championships! We are watching on Twitch, uncomprehending yet very proud!</p>&mdash; Marjorie Ingall (@MarjorieIngall) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarjorieIngall/status/1586865353476513792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 30, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>It was a dream so close to Steuer's heart, he couldn't bring himself to think about it during his incredible run. He wore his emotions on his sleeve throughout the tournament, including in a memorable moment after he lost what was a win-and-in for the Top 4. When he dropped that match, he saw his World Championship hope fade before his eyes—and with it that dream born 12 years ago.</p>

<p>But history—and his tiebreakers—were on his side. Steuer made the Top 4 of <i>Magic</i> World Championship XXVIII despite the final-round loss, and the rest became history. Just history the 20-year-old kept as far from his mind as possible.</p>

<p>"Honestly, I spent a lot of energy <i>not</i> thinking about the idea of winning the World Championship," he explained. "I feel like I fought the whole weekend to keep my mind in check. It was amazing with the World Champs and the stage and everything, but I wanted to keep my focus on playing <i>Magic</i> like I have all year.</p>

<p>"Even going into the finals, it was something I pushed out of my mind. It wasn't until the very final game, when I was in a good spot on board, that I started to let myself consider it."</p>

<p>In other words, Steuer may have been the last person at the World Championship to realize what has become more and more obvious over the past two years as the American has taken down online tournament after online tournament – two <i>Magic Online</i> Champions Showcase titles attest to that – and he cruised through the most challenging rounds of <i>Magic</i> imaginable in the World Championship.</p>

<p>Nathan Steuer is the best player in the world right now.</p>

<p>In a world of storied <i>Magic</i> professional careers that span decades and reputations that are often measured in years rather than months, it's rare for such a major tournament to showcase a transition so starkly. <i>Magic</i> World Championship XXVIII featured its share of past Pro Tour winners and Hall of Famers, but it also featured a host of younger players who grew up hoping for the chance to be paired against Reid Duke and have now come of age in the <i>MTG Arena</i> era of competition.</p>

<p>The 32-player World Championship field was filled with the best of this bunch. Steuer has spent the lsat few years testing with a handful of notable young players who also qualified for the World Championship, including David "Tangrams" Inglis, Sam Rolph, and Simon Nielsen. The shift captivated the competitive <i>Magic</i> world and is sure to be a dominant storyline again as we look toward the Pro Tour in 2023.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I’m just a fanboy here while those kings do their work.</p>&mdash; Michael Sigrist (@MSigrist83) <a href="https://twitter.com/MSigrist83/status/1586183920982204416?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 29, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Steuer has what even the best <i>Magic</i> professionals spend a lifetime chasing but never achieve. A World Championship changes things in a way no other tournament can, so what's next for the reigning champ?</p>

<p>Not all that much has changed since 2015.</p>

<p>"I want to win a Pro Tour," he said with a laugh. Premier competitive tabletop play will be found at <a href="https://twitter.com/wizards_magic/status/1586900840551714816" target="_blank">Magic Con Philadelphia</a> with the return of the Pro Tour. "I really want to Top 8 one, and winning one would kind of be the last thing to check off the list. But I'll start with practicing for the first Pro Tour back next year and doing everything I can to work at it like I did the World Championship, and hopefully make it to a Top 8."</p>

<p>Modest enough, coming from a player who has thus far achieved every goal he has set his sights on in competitive <i>Magic</i>. But as he already looks ahead to the next event, he's also finding more time to explore other aspects of <i>Magic</i> he hasn't had the chance to while chasing the World title.</p>

<p>"I've found that I really enjoy the teaching aspect of <i>Magic</i>," he explained. "When I was coming up, I had a lot of help from good players and adults around me who helped me play in events and level up my game. Now I'm spending more time coaching and doing the same for other players."</p>

<p>In the immediate future, we can expect more of the same from Steuer. He was already qualified for next year's <i>Magic</i> World Championship even before winning this year's—yes, he's now <i>double</i> qualified—and he remains the most accomplished player on the best testing team in the world. With so many titles under his belt, the <i>Magic</i> world in 2023 will be defined by Steuer and his peers, just like 2022.</p>

<p>Well, with maybe one difference.</p>

<p>"I cannot wait to have my face on a card that will hopefully be competitive!" Steuer gushed. "I've seen previous winners get to <a href="https://magic.gg/news/the-elite-spellbinder-paulo-vitor-damo-da-rosa" target="_blank">play with the card they designed</a>, and it's an amazing thing. I had my first planning call with Wizards on the card this week, and that's when it really began to sink in that I was the world champion."</p>

<p>The <i>Magic</i> 30 Championship was the biggest Modern event since the <auto-card>Yorion, Sky Nomad</auto-card> ban, and the winner's metagame held several surprises.</p>

<h1>The World Championship</h1>

<p>But first, allow me to say congratulations to <i>Magic</i>'s new World Champion, Nathan Steuer!</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/Z3Sbi9athPqufjbO5j1Cl/2ef9b6c6c8f43dd402ec85f3789e12ba/1920x1080-MWC-XXVIII-Gallery-Nathan-Steuer-With-Trophy.jpg" /></div></div><br />

<p>Nathan Steuer, one of the youngest members of the <i>Magic</i> World Championship XXVIII field, had risen through the ranks of competitive play online over the past few years. But his main previous successes were on <i>Magic Online</i>, where he had won the prestigious Champions Showcase twice. Last weekend, he was able to prove that he's also the best of the best at the highest possible competitive <i>Magi</i>c stage. You can find all the details on the <a href="https://magic.gg/events/magic-world-championship-xxviii" target="_blank"><i>Magic</i> World Championship XXVIII event coverage page</a>, but he impressed everyone by navigating complicated matchups with a level of skill befitting a World Champion.</p>

<p>To clinch the trophy and to have the honor of having his likeness feature on a future <i>Magic</i> card, he had to display mastery in both Standard and Explorer. In Standard, the most popular deck by far was Esper Midrange. It went 19-19 in non-mirror matches throughout all the World Championship Standard rounds. Many of those losses were at the hands of Nathan Steuer and <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/251300" target="_blank">his Grixis Midrange deck</a>; <auto-card>Corpse Appraiser</auto-card> turned out to be an excellent way to break the metagame. <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/251335" target="_blank">Izzet Tempo</a> and <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/251342" target="_blank">Mono-Blue Tempo</a> went 3-0 against Esper Midrange, so <auto-card>Haughty Djinn</auto-card> was a good choice as well. Jund Midrange and Jund Reanimator went 0-5 and 1-6 respectively against Esper Midrange, so they turned out to be poor choices for the field.</p>

<p>In Explorer, Mono-Blue Spirits was the best deck choice for the field by far. With a 17-5 non-mirror record, it put multiple players into the Top 4 playoffs. Most other archetypes hovered around the 50% winrate mark, with small sample sizes making it difficult to point out significant results. <a href="https://mtgmelee.com/Decklist/View/251330" target="_blank">Rakdos Midrange</a>, however, had the worst performance of all: 0-6 against the field. While Explorer differs from Pioneer—for example, Nythkos, Shrine to Nyx is not legal, which means fewer Devotion decks with <auto-card>Karn, the Great Creator</auto-card>, more artifact-reliant decks that crush Rakdos Midrange, and fewer anti-Devotion aggro decks that are weak to Rakdos Midrange–I have to imagine that the metagame in both Explorer and Pioneer will shift towards less Rakdos Midrange. Also, even though <auto-card>Spell Queller</auto-card> is not available in Explorer, fans of the tribe may want to give another look at Mono-Blue Spirits in Pioneer, as <auto-card>Curious Obsession</auto-card> can single-handedly win games.</p>

<h1>The Modern Qualifiers for the <i>Magic</i> 30 <i>Beta</i> Draft</h1>

<p>While Nathan Steuer was winning the World Championship, there was another major event on the other side of the <a href="https://magic.gg/news/magic-30-tickets-and-events-details" target="_blank"><i>Magic</i> 30</a> event hall: the <i>Magic</i> 30 Championship. Friday and Saturday featured four 224-player Modern qualifiers, making for nearly 1000 entrants in total, and the Top 8 from each qualifier advanced to the Top 32 on Sunday.</p>

<p>After two brutal single-elimination rounds, again with their Modern decks, the last eight standing on Sunday then get to the <i>Limited Edition Beta</i> Rochester Draft. In Rochester Draft, players take turns drafting from all cards opened in a booster pack, and all picks are known by each player. It's a high skill way to draft as there's no hidden information of what cards were opened and who may be playing them.</p>

<p>It was quite a spectacle, as iconic cards like <auto-card>Time Walk</auto-card>, <auto-card>Plateau</auto-card>, and <auto-card>Underground Sea</auto-card> were opened to the cheers of the crowd.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">8 players will soon be opening these <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Magic30?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Magic30</a> <a href="https://t.co/cbNqCpHEkf">pic.twitter.com/cbNqCpHEkf</a></p>&mdash; ⌽✯ 𝕋𝕙𝕖𝕎𝕚𝕝𝕝ℍ𝕒𝕝𝕝𝔼𝕩𝕡 ✯⌽ ➡️ Magic30 (@TheWillHallExp) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheWillHallExp/status/1586826191557709824?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 30, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>I received the paper Modern decklists of almost all 32 players who advanced to Sunday, and I'm excited to share them in this article today. First, here is the overall metagame breakdown.</p>

<br />

<p>Based on these results, <auto-card>Indomitable Creativity</auto-card> and Jeskai Breach are the Decks to Beat in Modern now. Both put many players in the Top 32, plus two in the Top 8. Rakdos Undying, Hammer Time, and Rhinos all put up solid results as well.</p>

<p>One of the biggest surprises was Merfolk, which put two players in the Top 8. The archetype has been growing in popularity ever since <i>Dominaria United</i> added <auto-card>Vodalian Hexcatcher</auto-card>, and this weekend marked its breakout. If you venture into a Modern tournament now, then be sure to factor in the possibility that an untapped <auto-card>Aether Vial</auto-card> on two counters may result in your noncreature spells getting countered.</p>

<p>Another surprise was a relatively poor showing of Izzet Murktide, Yawgmoth, and <auto-card>Living End</auto-card>. I don't know if they simply weren't popular in the qualifiers or whether they were unable to convert into the Top 32, but I had expected to see more of them.</p>

<p>In the remainder of this article, I'll provide all available decklists, grouped by archetype. I included the names of only the players who made the Top 8 because many others were not properly legible. The decklists that I received contained one duplicate, which I removed, and missed one Jeskai Breach player that <a href="https://twitter.com/TheWillHallExp/status/1586820246559604737" target="_blank">other sources</a> indicated had made the Top 8. So, I operate under the assumption that these two paper decklists were unfortunately swapped while collecting them for this article. Additional errors may not be impossible, but I was able to independently verify most lists as belonging to Sunday competitors. In any case, the remaining 31 decklists give an excellent snapshot of the current Modern metagame.</p>

<h1>Indomitable Creativity</h1>

===decklistId:Indomitable_Creativity_Justin_Rouse_Top_8__af1bed87-a8e7-4265-97df-30616a77c29b===

===decklistId:Indomitable_Creativity__Top_32_at_the_Beta_Draft_Qualifier__9530b3bb-c2d9-4bfd-ba2c-612c13f87413===

<p><auto-card>Indomitable Creativity</auto-card> is a top-tier deck in the current Modern metagame. The game plan is to fetch for <auto-card>Dwarven Mine</auto-card>, then use the namesake spell to transform the 1/1 token into a game-winning creature. <auto-card>Archon of Cruelty</auto-card> is the most common one. Thanks to <auto-card>Leyline Binding</auto-card> and <auto-card>Wrenn and Six</auto-card>, there's plenty of interaction in the early game.</p>

<p>The card choices of the two Top 8 players patch specific strategic holes. For context, <auto-card>Blood Moon</auto-card> and <auto-card>Orvar, the All-Form</auto-card> have became more prominent in recent weeks as answers to the ever-more-popular <auto-card>Indomitable Creativity</auto-card> archetype. Yet the lists of the Top 8 players show ways around them:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Justin Rouse's sideboard contains <auto-card>Abundant Growth</auto-card>, which helps beat <auto-card>Blood Moon</auto-card>.</li>
	<li>Wan Tingfeng's decklist contains <auto-card>Serra's Emissary</auto-card>, which is not affected by <auto-card>Orvar, the All-Form</auto-card>. (Orvar can be discarded to <auto-card>Archon of Cruelty</auto-card> to copy it and take over the game, so it's awesome sideboard tech, but it's useless against <auto-card>Serra's Emissary</auto-card>.)</li>
</ul>

<h1>Jeskai Breach</h1>

===decklistId:Jeskai_Breach_Chas_Hinkle_Top_8__95b326c0-bd03-46f1-a683-f8d163da9896===

===decklistId:Jeskai_Breach__Top_32_at_the_Beta_Draft_Qualifier__5ce77767-6f78-47b1-a355-7ac6be401f7f===

<p>Jeskai Breach is also a top-tier Modern deck, and it can win in various ways. One option is to combo off by repeatedly milling yourself. This involves sacrificing <auto-card>Mishra's Bauble</auto-card> or <auto-card>Mox Amber</auto-card> to <auto-card>Grinding Station</auto-card> and recasting the zero-mana artifact via <auto-card>Underworld Breach</auto-card>. You loop until you win the game with <auto-card>Thassa's Oracle</auto-card>. But if you don't draw the combo, then you can also win a fair game by attacking with <auto-card>Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer</auto-card>; <auto-card>Ledger Shredder</auto-card>; or <auto-card>Urza's Saga</auto-card> tokens.</p>

<p>I unfortunately did not receive the decklist of Michael Lee, one of the two Jeskai Breach players in the Top 8. The other, Chas Hinkle, made the most of his Beta draft experience.</p>

<h1>Rakdos Undying</h1>

===decklistId:Rakdos_Undying__Top_32_at_the_Beta_Draft_Qualifier__978c3793-d76f-4b27-adb9-10f1306b2b00===

===decklistId:Rakdos_Undying__Top_32_at_the_Beta_Draft_Qualifier__883f6801-828a-46b2-8316-2b9ae28e1c6b===

<p>The dream with Rakdos Undying is to evoke <auto-card>Grief</auto-card> of <auto-card>Fury</auto-card> on turn one, then cast <auto-card>Feign Death</auto-card> or <auto-card>Undying Malice</auto-card> to return it to the battlefield. In case of <auto-card>Grief</auto-card>, this yields two pain-free <auto-card>Thoughtseize</auto-card>s and a 4/3 menace on turn one. In case of <auto-card>Fury</auto-card>, it produces a 4/4 double striker on turn one. Both can leave opponents feeling like they were scammed out of playing a fair game.</p>

<p>One list has a fascinating combo: <auto-card>Lightning Skelemental</auto-card> plus <auto-card>Village Rites</auto-card>. The 6/1 haster gives the deck a more aggressive bent, and being able to sacrifice it to draw two cards is a sweet deal. Note that there is no synergy with <auto-card>Undying Malice</auto-card> because you also have to sacrifice <auto-card>Lightning Skelemental</auto-card> at the end of the opponent's end step.</p>

<h1>Hammer Time</h1>

===decklistId:Hammer_Time__Top_32_at_the_Beta_Draft_Qualifier__09e814aa-14ad-48af-92e9-600421cdd325===

===decklistId:Hammer_Time__Top_32_at_the_Beta_Draft_Qualifier__2a4fc828-60a5-49e9-ada3-44f9443103e6===

===decklistId:Hammer_Time__Top_32_at_the_Beta_Draft_Qualifier__494abc44-df91-472c-87ce-551f32351016===

<p>Hammer Time put three players in the Top 32, but all fell in the single-elimination rounds. The main goal of the deck is to attach <auto-card>Colossus Hammer</auto-card> for free with <auto-card>Sigarda's Aid</auto-card> or <auto-card>Puresteel Paladin</auto-card>. A turn-two kill is even possible with the right opening hand: <auto-card>Sigarda's Aid</auto-card> and <auto-card>Ornithopter</auto-card> on turn one, followed by double <auto-card>Colossus Hammer</auto-card> on turn two. Kills on turn three or turn four are more realistic and, thanks to <auto-card>Urza's Saga</auto-card> and <auto-card>Stoneforge Mystic</auto-card>, consistent.</p>

<h1>Merfolk</h1>

===decklistId:Merfolk_Jon_Paton_Top_8__84820ad9-b7a0-4195-a0ec-8e15b0890c14===

===decklistId:Merfolk_Jonathon_Zaczek_Top_8__7be5806e-795e-4b59-be85-11eec2ff7a20===

<p>Two Merfolk players made it to the Top 8, marking a breakout performance for the tribe. It has been slowly growing in popularity ever since <i>Dominaria United</i> added <auto-card>Vodalian Hexcatcher</auto-card>, which is particularly powerful against combo decks relying on expensive spells like <auto-card>Indomitable Creativity</auto-card>.</p>

<p>The two decklists have small differences in their creature bases, such as whether to use <auto-card>Harbinger of the Tides</auto-card> or <auto-card>Cursecatcher</auto-card>. Sideboard tweaks like <auto-card>Spreading Seas</auto-card> are also spicy, as they can turn on the islandwalk ability on <auto-card>Lord of Atlantis</auto-card>. If you have to decide between the two decklists, then I would trust the card choices of legendary Merfolk master Jonathon "Nikachu" Zaczek!</p>

<h1>Rhinos</h1>

===decklistId:Rhinos__Top_32_at_the_Beta_Draft_Qualifier__a891b897-2246-43e7-a376-e1132d032e13===

<p>Rhinos doesn't use <auto-card>Yorion, Sky Nomad</auto-card> anymore, and there are now several variants involving either <auto-card>Leyline Binding</auto-card> or <auto-card>Blood Moon</auto-card> in the main deck. But all of them try to cascade into <auto-card>Crashing Footfalls</auto-card> on turn three. I like the spicy <auto-card>Become Immense</auto-card> in one of the lists; it can lead to a lot of damage when pumping targeting trampling Rhinos or a double-striking <auto-card>Fury</auto-card>.</p>

<h1>Burn</h1>

===decklistId:Burn__Top_32_at_the_Beta_Draft_Qualifier__49781099-7d68-4602-8584-2f71f651e06c===

===decklistId:Burn__Top_32_at_the_Beta_Draft_Qualifier__3ecf9847-caa1-41d6-86ff-330758c676d4===

<p>The one surprise to point out here is two copies of <auto-card>Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer</auto-card> in the main deck of one of the two lists. I recently proposed this change several weeks ago because in my experience, the best draws from Burn are the ones where you stick one or two early creatures as repetitive damage sources. By going from 12 to 14 creatures, you increase the probability of having a creature in your opening hand from 81% to 86%, which is significant. It's nice to see other players find success with this as well.</p>

<h1>Four-Color Omnath</h1>

===decklistId:Four-Color_Omnath_Harrison_Kanfer_Top_8__c651ea0b-e3a8-48f2-8e38-863825235731===

<p>This 60-card list is how Four-Color Omnath can look like with <auto-card>Kaheera, the Orphanguard</auto-card> instead of <auto-card>Yorion, Sky Nomad</auto-card>. The list is controlling in nature and almost seems like an Azorius Control deck splashing for <auto-card>Omnath, Locus of Creation</auto-card>; <auto-card>Expressive Iteration</auto-card>; and <auto-card>Wrenn and Six</auto-card>. Indeed, with <auto-card>Teferi, Hero of Dominaria</auto-card> and <auto-card>Jace, the Mind Sculptor</auto-card> in the flex slots, there is a lot of interaction and card advantage in the late game. This may be the new look of Four-Color Omnath.</p>

<h1>Other Archetypes</h1>

<p>The remaining archetypes are singletons that did not survive the single-elimination rounds yet showcase the diversity of the Modern format.</p>

<p><a href="https://magic.gg/news/return-of-the-pro-tour-your-path-to-playing-magic-at-the-highest-level" target="_blank">The new Path to the Pro Tour is already underway</a> and as players are competing to qualify for the first Pro Tour of 2023—"Pro Tour 1" taking place in Philadelphia, PA, USA—we have more details for you on the qualifying round for the second Pro Tour next year, "Pro Tour 2."</p>

<h1>Upcoming Regional Championship Qualifiers</h1>

<p>The qualifying round for the Regional Championships for Pro Tour 2 starts October 1, 2022, and runs through December 18, 2022. Participating WPN stores as well as larger organizers will be running Regional Championship Qualifiers (RCQs) that provide invitation to the Regional Championship for their respective region. These Regional Championships will take place in the first quarter of 2023 and qualify players for Pro Tour 2 later in 2023.</p>

<p>This round of RCQs includes new promos you can earn competing in these events within your region—and this time, they feature new, never-before-seen art in a borderless treatment:</p>

<p>Eli Kassis. One of the veterans of the field. The longtime pro who has consistently upped his game over the years, his hard work paying off with a title at the Neon Dynasty Championship.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/3B9rCrrmjeKUXpimWtAMf8/97bea2b79627971586d1dbcf3cbe3fd7/1920x1280-MWC-XXVIII-Nathan-Steuer-Trophy.jpg" /><p class="embedImageCaption">Nathan Steuer</p></div></div><br />

<p>Nathan Steuer. The wunderkind and <i>Magic Online</i> endboss who has risen through the ranks of competitive play online over the past three years and put it all together in 2022 with a string of event victories, a World Championship qualification and now a finals run.</p>

<p>Two friends and competitors, now facing off where only one would earn the title of <i>Magic</i> World Champion.</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><embed-iframe fallback-img="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/1TzbKdTr0eC7lEIZh8S2hP/21f407e22dca180089c98aa97de01080/1920x1080_Blue_Background_Full.png" has-consent="true"   src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=ThirstyFancyChowderTooSpicy-6YZTnUFd2eXogmqH&autoplay=false" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" height="561" width="920"></embed-iframe></p>

<p>As the finals opened, Kassis led with a pair of the flexible <auto-card>Wedding Announcement</auto-card>, while a pair of <auto-card>Make Disappear</auto-card> provided Steuer with a reactive opening hand. Instead, Steuer found <auto-card>Fable of the Mirror-Breaker</auto-card>, which he opted to deploy over leaving up interaction.</p>

<p>Fable proved one of the strongest cards in a wide variety of formats, and Steuer followed his first with a second copy. It led to a flow of Treasures, powering the second <auto-card>Make Disappear</auto-card> on Kassis' turn.</p>

<magic-cards>
  548443
  Make Disappear
  548399
</magic-cards>

<p>Ahead on both card selection and mana, Steuer found himself in commanding position to deploy what might be his best card against the Esper MIdrange decks: <auto-card>Invoke Despair</auto-card>, and it was aptly named. A bunch of sacrifices later, Kassis fell to the clean-up <auto-card>Liliana of the Veil</auto-card> that destroyed his hand.</p>

<p>It was a lightning-fast first game that turned on a dime; the second clash in the match was the complete opposite. Neither player cast a spell until the fourth turn, when <auto-card>Bloodtithe Harvester</auto-card> on Steuer's side opened the floodgates.</p>

<p>From there, an <auto-card>Anointed Peacekeeper</auto-card> for Kassis (naming the <auto-card>Infernal Grasp</auto-card> that did indeed reside in Steuer's hand) gave him the lead in tempo, and a follow-up Kaito Shizuke put him ahead on cards as well. On the defensive, Steuer tried to block with a <auto-card>Bloodtithe Harvester</auto-card>, only for it to fall to a channeled <auto-card>Eiganjo, Seat of the Empire</auto-card>. That exchange cleared the path for Kassis to resolve <auto-card>The Wandering Emperor</auto-card>, and a follow-up <auto-card>Raffine, Scheming Seer</auto-card> a turn later was more than though to beat Steur's land-heavy hand and send the pair into a third game.</p>

<magic-cards>
  548337
  555414
  548538
</magic-cards>

<p>The decider (of the first match of the best-of-three) saw competing three-drops resolved, as Steuer had <auto-card>Fable of the Mirror-Breaker</auto-card> against Kassis' <auto-card>Kaito Shizuki</auto-card>. Both players had found their engines and the match hinged on who could best leverage it, though it certainly took some time to sort out. The reflection of Kiki-Jiki gave Steuer a steady stream of <auto-card>Corpse Appraiser</auto-card>s while Kassis leaned on Kaito and Raffine for his cards.</p>

<p>The result? As it has often in this format, Raffine's schemes proved superior to all other forms of card advantage, and a massive attack with four creatures allowed Kassis to pump an unblockable token to epic proportions to take down the first match of the World Championship final.</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><embed-iframe fallback-img="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/1TzbKdTr0eC7lEIZh8S2hP/21f407e22dca180089c98aa97de01080/1920x1080_Blue_Background_Full.png" has-consent="true"   src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=SavoryCheerfulCoyoteTakeNRG-gY6zXAnHIRgMon2v&autoplay=false" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" height="561" width="920"></embed-iframe></p>

<p>The opening game of the second match played out differently than the first. Neither player was able to get out to a huge early advantage, but both set up value engines with <auto-card>Reckoner Bankbuster</auto-card> for Steuer and <auto-card>The Wandering Emperor</auto-card> for Kassis. When Steuer attempted to fight back with a planeswalker of his own, <auto-card>Liliana of the Veil</auto-card> ran headlong into <auto-card>Ertai Resurrected</auto-card>. It was a game-defining play for Kassis, who followed up with <auto-card>Ao, the Dawn Sky</auto-card>.</p>

<p>Ao fell from the sky thanks to <auto-card>Infernal Grasp</auto-card>, but even more concerning for Kassis was completely whiffing on its trigger and finding nothing to put into play. That forced a chump-block to save his Emperor from Bankbuster, and Kassis was forced to pass the turn back ahead on board but with his shields down. Would Steuer capitalize on the moment?</p>

<p>He could, and did. He played a seventh land and lined things up perfectly for both a Sheoldred of his own as well as a Fable. That eliminated the advantage Kassis had hoped to gain, and when another <auto-card>Invoke Despair</auto-card> followed Steuer had again taken the first game of the match.</p>

<p>This time it was the second game of the match that went fast. Steuer landed an early <auto-card>Reckoner Bankbuster</auto-card>, but when it fell to a removal spell and he had no answer for the Sheoldred that followed, he scooped his cards up quickly to move to game three.</p>

<p>That meant that Kassis was now just one game away from winning the World Championship title. But a slow start with match point on the line meant he couldn't deploy <auto-card>Negate</auto-card> to head off <auto-card>Fable of the Mirror-Breaker</auto-card>. When Steuer transformed it into its creature side and began to accumulate value, Kassis looked for a way back into the game. <auto-card>Sanctuary Warden</auto-card> was a start, but it wasn't enough. Steuer found interaction on the top of his deck and finally broke his losing streak against Kassis evening up the title match with one match apiece.</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><embed-iframe fallback-img="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/1TzbKdTr0eC7lEIZh8S2hP/21f407e22dca180089c98aa97de01080/1920x1080_Blue_Background_Full.png" has-consent="true"   src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=BlightedWealthyOxLitty-MgPMLWjYRTur-_Qb&autoplay=false" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" height="561" width="920"></embed-iframe></p>

<p>This was it. One final match with the title on the line. A World Champion was about to be crowned.</p>

<p>But to start, Kassis would have to do it short on lands. He failed to find a fourth as Steuer systematically rstopped his early plays via countermagic, removal, and then <auto-card>Liliana of the Veil</auto-card>. That put Kassis heavily on the back foot and at just 10 life while Steuer built a battlefield with <auto-card>Corpse Appraiser</auto-card> and more. Sheoldred from Steuer was the final blow.</p>

<p>This time Game 2 belonged to Kassis. Steuer couldn't find blue mana, and the duo were quickly on to the final game, with absolutely everything attached to it.</p>

<p>A second turn <auto-card>Reckoner Bankbuster</auto-card> from Steuer forced the action from Kassis, but that left the door open for Steuer to deploy the topdecked <auto-card>Fable of the Mirror-Breaker</auto-card> to the board. And when Steuer untapped with Fable, he devised a gameplan around protecting a reflection of Kiki-Jiki. That meant holding up countermagic as Kassis struggled to make land drops, and several turns later the Reflection was ready to begin copying creatures–protected by a pair of counterspells.</p>

<p>That fourth land Kassis needed never came. But the <auto-card>Corpse Appraiser</auto-card> from Steuer did, and a it was all over. Nathan Steuer had battled back from dropping three matches in the row to Kassis, claiming the final victory screen of the weekend.</p>

<p><a href="https://magic.gg/events/magic-world-championship-xxviii" target="_blank"><i>Magic </i>World Championship XXVIII</a> kicked off on Friday with 32 competitors who spent the past year working toward this moment. We were treated to two days of incredible competition through three formats that all brought their own challenges, not to mention the nerves that only an event like a World Championship can bring.</p>

<p>Now here we are, with the final four from the fracas battling it out in a double-elimination bracket for the title of World Champion.</p>

<p>Here's how the Top 4 played out.</p>

<h1>The Upper Bracket</h1>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/xGdRqXfNJWGi4ZazNSMF2/2d908d7435f315c5462d4d2761350498/Magic-World-Championship-XXVIII-Top-4-Player-Bracket-00.jpg" /></div></div><br />

<p>Round 14 of <i>Magic </i>World Championship XXVIII came packed with as much drama as possible, as many final rounds do. In this case, and no players secured the 11 wins nededto guarantee themselves a Top 4 spot, things stood more open than usual. That brought on the biggest match of young Nathan Steuer's life: a clean win-and-in against Eli Kassis, who stood atop the crowded standings.</p>

<p>The result was a heartbreaking match for Steuer, who came up just short. But when the dust settled and the tiebreakers were sorted out, it was Steuer who occupied the fourth and final spot on the Sunday stage, following Kassis after he secured the top slot. That meant that the first match of the Top 4 bracket would be a rematch of Round 14, and an opportunity for Steuer to avenge his Historic loss with a trip back to Standard.</p>

<p>After the players split the first two games, it all came down to a third to decide the match. And as players traded resources back and forth it looked like the Grixis Midrange deck piloted by Steuer would do what it was designed to do: grind out the Esper Midrange deck that was piloted by 69% of the field and the three other members of the Top 4.</p>

<p>But <auto-card>Sanctuary Warden</auto-card> changed all that. Kassis landed the bomb Angel and used it to stave off defeat long enough for Sheolded, the Apocalypse to arrive. Another incredibly close match between the pair, and another going to Kassis.</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><embed-iframe fallback-img="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/1TzbKdTr0eC7lEIZh8S2hP/21f407e22dca180089c98aa97de01080/1920x1080_Blue_Background_Full.png" has-consent="true"   src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=SpicyBusyPlumageUWot--MIyWEEvCXKyLc-q&autoplay=false" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" height="561" width="920"></embed-iframe></p>

<p>The other match of the semifinals featured Sarap and Tóth battling in an Esper Midrange mirror. Or, more accurately, the <auto-card>Wedding Announcement</auto-card> mirror. Both players flooded the board with tokens and the grindy games were everything the midrange mirror promised to be. Combat became increasingly tricky and each player looked for a way to go over the top.</p>

<p>After a narrow victory in the opener, Tóth found a way to go over the top in the next game, though perhaps not in the way he expected; Sarap got stuck on three lands and a much healthier mix of mana allowed Tóth to slowly pull ahead on board until his army of tokens grew too large for Sarap to match.</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><embed-iframe fallback-img="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/1TzbKdTr0eC7lEIZh8S2hP/21f407e22dca180089c98aa97de01080/1920x1080_Blue_Background_Full.png" has-consent="true"   src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=BlindingGeniusPangolinHassaanChop-VnjINI6nK0GD2gEg&autoplay=false" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" height="561" width="920"></embed-iframe></p>

<p>Next up was the Upper Finals. The winner between Kassis and Tóth would move on to the best-two-of-three-matches Title Match while the loser would await either Steuer or Sarap from the Lower Semifinals.</p>

<p>The two teammates had met twice previously in the tournament, splitting the matches with Tóth coming out on top in Standard. But in the rematch it was all Kassis all the way, as he leveraged a stream of high-level threats against an off-balance Tóth forced into a reactive role.</p>

<p>The second game played out similarly, with Sheolded doing the heavy lifting to prop up Kassis while <auto-card>Raffine, Scheming Seer</auto-card> did what it has done all weekend: sculpt the perfect hand while growing a board presence. The curve out allowed Kassis to take the driver's seat in the deciding game, until <auto-card>Ludevic, Necrogenius</auto-card> arrived to seal the deal.</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><embed-iframe fallback-img="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/1TzbKdTr0eC7lEIZh8S2hP/21f407e22dca180089c98aa97de01080/1920x1080_Blue_Background_Full.png" has-consent="true"   src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=ExpensiveAmazingAlbatrossKAPOW-_K41C-J7MH4Pxq40&autoplay=false" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" height="561" width="920"></embed-iframe></p>

<p>With that, the first Title Match participant was in. Kassis, who has been a longtime Pro Tour player with eight Grand Prix Top 8s and two wins to his name, has truly broken through over the past several seasons with two Top Finishes including a victory at the Neon Dynasty Championship. Now he found himself to add the one trophy he's missing: the world title.</p>

<h1>The Lower Bracket</h1>

<p>With that, all that remained was to determine who would meet Kassis in the World Championship Title Match.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/7vJgx9jui5MQILT34SjT4o/e1a79e76b350b6441740744176e7f5f0/Magic-World-Championship-XXVIII-Top-4-Player-Bracket-04.jpg" /></div></div><br />

<p>It began with Steuer and Sarap, where an unfortunate day for Sarap continued as he failed to keep up with Steur's value engines in the first game, then fell apart in the second as he couldn't find an answer to <auto-card>Fable of the Mirror-Breaker</auto-card>.</p>

<p>The powerful enchantment was the reason Steuer chose to play a Grixis deck over Esper, and it paid off with a quick 2-0 victory that sent Steuer to the lower final against Tóth.</p>

<p>In the Title Match, Kassis awaited the winner. It would be his teammate Tóth, or a prodigious competitor who took the online world by storm?</p>

<p>Steuer wanted another shot at Kassis, and thanks to <auto-card>Invoke Despair</auto-card> that's exactly what he would get. Steuer's contorted manabase supported the difficult-to-cast sorcery, but doing sopaid off the Lower Finals as he was able to cast the game-winning bomb after both players had whittled each other out of resources.</p>

<p>A long and complex first game had gone Steuer's way, and the next game proved it was his day: Tóth never found a third land, and a few turns later Steuer won his way into the Title Match and one more rematch against Kassis.</p>

Competitors were back to battle for their place in the Top 4 through six rounds of Explorer, the third format for the weekend and one left wide open by the small field. With nerves, matchups, and math to manage, the Saturday sprint to elimination rounds provided all the drama that only a World Championship can provide, and it didn't disappoint.</p>

<p>We also thought we knew what the road to the Top 4 might look like. A pair of the youngest players in the tournament in Julian Wellman and Nathan Steuer had outpaced the field on Friday, and early in Day Two it looked like they might cruise into Sunday. But as the early rounds faded into the afternoon, so too did the leaders of the field. As we entered the final rounds of Explorer, everything was still on the table and no one had locked the 11 wins for a Top 4 berth.</p>

<p>The scrum of players battling it out for win-and-ins was a joy to watch. When the dust settled, one leader had managed to squeak into the Top 4 of <i>Magic</i> World Championship XXVIII.</p>

<h1>From Explorer to the Top 4</h1>

<p>The unique challenge presented by the World Championship was that players must have a mastery of <i>three</i> separate formats to do well: <i>Dominaria United</i> Draft, Standard, and Explorer, a more recent addition to formats on <i>MTG Arena</i> (that's every Pioneer legal card there).<i>.</i> And no matter how well players did in Draft and Standard on Day One, it would all be for naught if they couldn't bring see it through with performance in Explorer.</p>

<p>A diverse field offered up incredible games all day, including what was almost certainly of the match of the day in Round 11, as Jakub Tóth and his team's well-positioned Mono-Blue Spirits deck tore through a field of powerful-but-sometimes-clunky decks like <auto-card>Greasefang, Okiba Boss</auto-card> and <auto-card>Transmogrify</auto-card>-into-<auto-card>Titan of Industry</auto-card> (or <auto-card>Hornet Queen</auto-card>) combos.</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><embed-iframe fallback-img="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/1TzbKdTr0eC7lEIZh8S2hP/21f407e22dca180089c98aa97de01080/1920x1080_Blue_Background_Full.png" has-consent="true"   src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=PoliteUglyHerringStrawBeary-Z9RxTV5mY-9dVHFJ&autoplay=false" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" height="561" width="920"></embed-iframe></p>

<p>Backed up by creatures that could poke in early damage (and be boosted by <auto-card>Supreme Phantom</auto-card>), the Spirits deck backed up its aggressive starts with <auto-card>Curious Obsession</auto-card> and a host of countermagic to keep the other decks off balance. Between <auto-card>Rattlechains</auto-card>, <auto-card>Mausoleum Wanderer</auto-card> and the countermagic the mono-blue deck could play at instant speed and choose between deploying creatures or interacting with the stack. They even put <auto-card>Leyline of Combustion</auto-card> in the sideboard, unable to cast it in the main deck at all, for the anticipated <auto-card>Witch's Oven</auto-card> and <auto-card>Cauldron Familiar</auto-card> sacrifice decks.</p>

<p>It was a brilliant, effective plan that propelled its five pilots to strong finishes.</p>

<p>"We really liked the deck. Greasefang was our best matchup," explained Kassis, who finished as the only undefeated 6-0 Explorer player. "During our testing we played five matches between the two decks, and then switched sides for five more; Spirits won them all. That helped us feel more comfortable with it."</p>

<p>It was clear that the field was ready for Abzan Greasefang. In addition to Kassis, Jakub Tóth also punched his Top 4 ticket with a "spirited" run on Saturday, his final victory coming over Jim Davis in an incredibly intricate Spirits mirror in Round 14. <auto-card>Supreme Phantom</auto-card> is great; all four of them is <i>even better</i> and in an absolute heartbreaker for Davis he ended up one creature short.</p>

<p>Tóth's incredible run had at least one fan ready for more to come.</p>

<p>The next player to lock up their spot was Sarap. One of the best underdog stories this year, his win-and-in for Worlds would come against none other than the defending World Championship himself: Yuta Takahashi. The Japanese titan put together a strong second-half run of his own to move into Top 4 contention, and found himself on the verge of the back-to-back opportunity, but Sarap and his army of "Temur Rhinos" (<auto-card>Transmogrify</auto-card> into <auto-card>Titan of Industry</auto-card>, then choose to make a 4/4 Rhino token) knocked off the previously undefeated-on-Day Two Takahashi to secure the second Top Finish of his career and the biggest finish for him to date.</p>

<p>That left one spot to fill, and as the field flattened throughout the day it was a tossup where things would land. And with Kassis having already locked his spot, Steuer had a clean win-and-in. But he fell to a turn-zero <auto-card>Leyline of Combustion</auto-card> in the final round, leaving him to sweat tiebreakers as all waited for the final spot to fill.</p>

<p>And in the span of just a few minutes, the wunderkind who dominated online play this year went from the depths of defeat to the heights of making the final rounds of a World Championship.</p>

<p>With that, the Top 4 of <i>Magic</i> World Championship XXVIII was set!</p>

<h1>Looking Ahead</h1>

<p>If the first two days of the World Championship were all about fighting through a myriad of unique challenges across multiple formats, the final day is all about mastery of Standard. With three Esper Midrange decks and Steuer's Grixis Midrange flavor, the games are sure to feature lots of critical decisions and plenty of <auto-card>Raffine, Scheming Seer</auto-card>s.</p>

<p>Steuer will have a chance against Kassis to avenge his Round 14 loss: they'll meet in the first round tomorrow in a Grixis-Esper matchup. Meanwhile, Tóth and Sarap will battle in the Esper mirror. It's a double-elimination format, affording all four players ample opportunity to advance to the best-of-three-matches Title Match.</p>

<p>Sarap may be the best Limited player in the <i>Magic</i> World Championship XXVIII field, though he still refers to himself as a "future professional <i>Magic</i> player." Originally from Europe but living in Columbia, Sarap has found his success largely through digital <i>Magic,</i> rising to the top of the <i>Magic Online</i> leaderboards. He qualified for <i>Magic</i> World Championship XXVIII with a memorable run through the New Capenna Championship working with David Inglis and an invite-clinching victory over fellow qualifier Zachary Kiihne in the Top 8.</p>

The culmination of a season of play, a series of set championships, a monthslong points race and a final, furious flurry of testing, <a href="https://magic.gg/events/magic-world-championship-xxviii" target="_blank"><i>Magic</i> World Championship XXVIII</a> is the pinnacle of competitive play and the biggest tournament of these players' lives. Ensconced in the spectacle that is <i>Magic</i> 30, everything came down to this.</p>

<p>And in one of the biggest moments in their lives, Julian Wellman and Nathan Steuer came up clutch. Two of the field's youngest players showed they're ready to take on the World Championship, and both finished the day 7-1 after meeting as the final two undefeated players late. Along the way we journeyed through <i>Dominaria United</i> draft and five Standard rounds featuring a field full of Esper and several players who came prepared to take advantage of that fact. Here's how we got there.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align: right or left or center;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="//images.ctfassets.net/ryplwhabvmmk/4jYrvjGoNB7qYfCLwG00E1/1562eb8e6641728f45aeffca22b9d2f9/1920x1080-MWC-XXVIII-EOD1-Wellman-and-Steuer-Lead-the-Way.jpg" /><p class="embedImageCaption">Team Handshake teammates Nathan Steuer and Julian Wellman stand atop the field at 7-1.</p></div></div><br />

<h1>Deft Dominaria United Drafters</h1>

<p>It's rare for a draft format to divide opinions weeks after its release, but <i>Dominaria United</i> is the rare set to do that. With dozens of multicolor cards, kicker cards, and a bevy of mana fixing lands, the format has proven to be a classic.</p>

<p>Perfect for a World Championship showdown.</p>

<p>This weekend brought Limited back to the highest levels of competitive play, to the delight of many in the field. For longtime players such as Reid Duke, Mike Sigrist, and Shota Yasooka, it was a welcome return to a staple of the Pro Tour. But for some of the newer players who qualified for this event largely via online Constructed play, Draft was both a major point of emphasis and the source of their biggest concerns.</p>

<p>Any doubts were laid to rest quickly though. The largest testing team in the field, <a href="https://magic.gg/news/joining-forces-for-magic-world-championship-xxviii" target="_blank">and by far the most successful team of the past season</a>, dominated the <i>Dominaria United</i> draft at a level reserved for some of the most masterful team performances in Pro Tour memory.</p>

<p>More than enough to impress at least one former World Champion.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Apparently Team Handshake had a 17-4 record in draft (excluding teamkills) for an 81% winrate!

<p>After three rounds of Draft, all four undefeated players hailed from the Team Handshake squad:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Julian Wellman</li>
	<li>Nathan Steuer</li>
	<li>Jonny Gutman</li>
	<li>Tristan Wylde-Larue</li>

<p><i>That's</i> how you take a field by storm.</p>

<p>"We had a testing team of nine people, so we were able to get complete draft pods to practice in and I think that really helped us," explained Wylde-LaRue, who finished Friday 5-3.</p>

<p>"I knew lots of people liked the base-green domain decks and would pick the lands highly. I liked drafting Jeskai the most, but other people weren't as high on it. I ended up first-picking <auto-card>Shivan Devastator</auto-card> and then moved into white in the middle of pack one. I also picked up <auto-card>Weatherlight Compleated</auto-card>, which is a card I had never played before. Some people I showed my deck thought a Grizzly Bear would be better. But after playing three rounds with it, it was definitely way better than that!"</p>

<p>And with that, we were off to the Standard races.</p>

<h1>The Kids Are All Right (On Top of the Standings)</h1>

<p>The biggest takeaway from Day One of <i>Magic</i> World Championship XXVIII was clear: the torch has been passed in competitive <i>Magic.</i></p>

<p>As the players converged on Las Vegas, we all wondered whether the latest generation of online-first players could manage the pressure of the moment against seasoned vets like Reid Duke and Logan Nettles (both of whom also got their start on <i>Magic Online</i> many years ago), as the World Championship brought together competitors who all qualified in a myriad of unique ways. And after one day of competition and a leaderboard filled with competitors who got their competitive start on <i>MTG Arena</i> over the last few years, that question has been answered.</p>

<p>The Hall of Famers are still here. But resumes don't win matches: players do. Eight rounds of Day One play showcased that everyone at the World Championship was capable of staring down even the best to ever play the game without blinking.</p>

<p>Wellman and Steuer led the way. Two of the most successful online players this year, with Steuer the endboss of <i>Magic Online</i> Champions Showcase events and Wellman spearheading incredible success at Championships across the season, met in Round 5 of <i>Magic</i> World Championship XXVIII still undefeated.</p>

<p>It was Wellman who emerged unscathed from the battle, and he would cruise into Day Two from there adjusting to the bright lights and stage of the World Championship.</p>

<p>As the dust settled on the Standard rounds, the other takeaway was that the 68% Esper Midrange field may have actually been more open than expected.</p>

<p>Wellman blazed a path with Izzet Tempo as Jean-Emmanuel Depraz chased right before with Mono-Blue Tempo deck, the pair cut their way through a field of <auto-card>The Wandering Emperor</auto-card> and <auto-card>Raffine, Scheming Seer</auto-card>.</p>

<h1>Looking Ahead</h1>

<p>Players shift gears Saturday morning as they return for Day Two and six rounds of the exciting Explorer format. It's a challenging triple format event (along with Draft and Standard) that tests the mettle of the players by putting a spotlight on whether any team was able to gain a true advantage against the field. You can <a href="https://magic.gg/decklists/magic-world-championship-xxviii-explorer-decklists" target="_blank">find all the Explorer decklists online now</a>, with <a href="https://magic.gg/news/the-7-spiciest-explorer-decks-at-magic-world-championship-xxviii" target="_blank">the seven spiciest of them as highlighted by Hall of Famer Frank Karsten</a>.</p>

<p>As Steuer and Wellman lead the way, we'll watch six rounds of Explorer setting a Top 4 returning Sunday.

Players can earn individual card rewards (ICRs) and in-game cosmetics for wins.</p>

  </div>
<p>Midweek <em>Magic </em>began as FNM at Home in March of 2020, developed to keep the fun of Friday Night <em>Magic</em> events alive when players couldn't visit their local game stores. Thankfully, in-store play slowly resumed in many locations, and Friday Night <em>Magic</em> returned.</p>
<p>We didn't want to lose the fun and community around FNM at Home, so we updated our FNM at Home event to take place from Tuesdays to Thursdays and renamed it Midweek <em>Magic</em>. Now, you can enjoy <em>Magic </em>during the week on <em>MTG Arena</em> and then connect with your friends at your local game store for fun, in-person Friday Night <em>Magic</em> events, too!</p>

<!-- Midweek Magic Schedule -->
<p><em>Updated February 13, 2023</em>
    <p>Midweek <em>Magic</em> events begin on Tuesdays at 8 a.m. PT and end on Thursdays at 8 a.m. PT (UTC -08:00).</p>

  </li>
  <li><strong>March 7–9: On the Edge</strong></em><br />

<p>While making original <em>Innistrad</em>, one of our challenges was resisting the pull to make everything black. The world had a black center, and it would have been easy to just make every monster black, but <em>Magic</em> has five colors that need to be evenly balanced (although design did try to do a few more black cards than the other colors, but development nixed it for Limited balance reasons—that's why you're unlikely to see something like <em>Torment </em>or <em>Judgment</em> again), which means every monster couldn't be in black. After examining the ethos of Werewolves, we decided that it was about Humans reverting to their primal nature and that we could set them in red and green.</p>

<p>Fast-forward to <em>Innistrad: Midnight Hunt</em> vision design. We knew we wanted a Werewolf focus for the set, so we decided it would be cool to add them in a third color. Black was the obvious choice. It was the color the first three Werewolves had been in, all pre-<em>Innistrad</em>, and the one we'd resisted picking in the first place. So, we added three black Werewolves to the set, a vertical cycle (one common, one uncommon, and one rare). Shady Traveler // Stalking Predator, the common, was just made to be a French vanilla (i.e., a creature with just creature keywords and no other rules text) Werewolf with menace.</p>

<p>We looked at creature keywords exclusive to black (deathtouch or lifelink) but found menace just worked better. For the uncommon, Baneblade Scoundrel // Baneclaw Marauder, we did look at giving it something that black would do that neither red or green would (barring flanking from many years ago), granting -1/-1 to blockers. The backside had a trigger when blocking creatures died, and we made it life loss rather than damage to feel more black than red.</p>

<p>For the rare, Graveyard Trespasser // Graveyard Glutton leaned even more into black color pie space. First up, we gave it ward with discard, something only black would do. Second, we had it exile cards from the graveyard (an ability primary in black) and had it drain the opponent if that was a creature card (an effect unique to black and, interestingly, the combination of red-white). All three cards were designed to play nicely with other Werewolf cards if you wanted to try playing a black-red, black-green, or black-red-green Werewolf deck.</p>

<p>But we didn't stop there. Was there a way to get a Werewolf in white and blue? Neither color was a great fit for Werewolves, so we tried something a little different. What if the front side was white or blue and when it turned into a Werewolf, it became either red or green?</p>

<p>We chose to make white turn into the red Werewolf and blue into the green Werewolf as those were enemy colors. The trick was to make sure the backside was close enough mechanically to the front color, as that's the color of mana you needed to cast it so that it didn't break the color pie while feeling like the right color on the back.</p>

<p>With Moonrage Brute, it gained first strike, an ability shared by red, white, and ward—pay 3 life, an ability that white and red share, but done in the way we do it in red (white, blue, and green use a mana payment as a base, whereas black and red use a life payment). It ended up protecting the creature, so that felt like an acceptable bend in white. Seafaring Werewolf has two abilities, can't be blocked, an ability primary in blue, and "curiosity" (drawing a card when you deal combat damage), an ability shared between green and blue.</p>

<p>I'm happy that the Werewolf set was able to get a creature of each color that can become a Werewolf.</p>

<p><strong>Cathar Commando </strong></p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Cathar Commando" src="https://media.wizards.com/2021/mid/en_oUP44cToxT.png" /></p>

<p>Two quick comments about this card:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Part of rejiggering white consisted of us looking at subtle ways to help the color. I know normally when I talk about white recently, it's in the context of card drawing or ramping, but there are other facets we've been exploring. We have made the choice to upgrade flash in white from tertiary to secondary (look for a new mechanical color pie article coming later this year) as part of this master plan. We think it will help white feel a little more defensive, but in a way that helps white win the game rather than just stall.</li>
	<li>After making so many vanilla 3/1s for 1W over the years, it's interesting for me to see us make cards strictly better than it. Cathar Commando is better in two ways than the vanilla. I'm curious to see what the future holds for 1W 3/1's.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Curses</strong></p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Curse of Silence" src="https://media.wizards.com/2021/mid/en_vEJssIW9Fb.png" /><img alt="Curse of Surveillance" src="https://media.wizards.com/2021/mid/en_Dj66bd8PF7.png" /></p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Curse of Leeches" src="https://media.wizards.com/2021/mid/en_4GGMSIryyP.png" /><img alt="Curse of Shaken Faith" src="https://media.wizards.com/2021/mid/en_17jUdpj3Mt.png" /></p>

<p>I'm writing this article before the players have seen the set, but I already know a common question I'm going to receive, so I figured I'll just get ahead of the issue. Where's the green Curse? The set has exactly four Curses, one in each color except green. What's going on? There are two different answers, so I'll give them both. For every set before I write my various articles, I take time to go through and look at all the cards. While I'm very involved in all the vision designs of the premier sets, usually two years goes by between my handing them off and them seeing print. (I do peek my head in from time to time in sets downstream in that two-year span.) That means many things change, and even when things stay the same, I've worked on a lot of sets since.</p>

<p>While looking through the file, I often will take notes. Which cards might be fun for my teaser? Which cards might make good card-by-card stories? Which cards do I have questions about to ask the set design lead or the creative lead? While looking through the file, I was tagging all the Curses as cards I might want to talk about. I created them many years ago, so I thought maybe I'd share the story of their evolution. Seeing one in white, one in blue, and one in black, I assumed they were a cycle. When the red one popped up, I added it to my list. But then when I got to green, there wasn't one.</p>

<p>This prompted a flashback to original <em>Innistrad</em>. We'd purposefully put Curses in every color but white to show how white was the last holdout in a world of monsters. Then we put a white Curse in <em>Dark Ascension</em> to show how bad it's gotten for the Humans that even white got a Curse. My plan got a little derailed though when Erik Lauer, the lead developer of original <em>Innistrad</em>, unaware of my plans (I'd failed to spell it out in my handoff design document) cut the green Curse from the set. "Not again," I thought to myself.</p>

<p>So, I wrote a text to Ian Duke, the co-set design lead on the set (Erik handed the set off to him midway through set design) and asked, "Where's the green Curse?" Ian informed me that it wasn't a cycle. For most of set design, there wasn't a Curse in black either, so no one thought of it as a cycle. The black one got added very late to fill a hole, and no one on the set design team noticed because it wasn't a pattern they were thinking about. I know it's very easy to spot things after the fact, but when you've been intimately involved with a file for a long time, it's sometimes hard to notice things as things slowly change each day. My best comparison is how people see differences in my kids that I hadn't processed because I'd seen them every day and, thus, the change happened so gradually that I wasn't aware of it.</p>

<p>Which leads us to the larger question—why isn't green getting Curses? In fact, there have only ever been two green Curses, and both were done in a cycle of Curses. The answer is green's mechanics don't lend themselves well to Curses. Curses are meant to be enchantments that add negative consequences to players, and that just isn't something very easy to do with green's suite of abilities.</p>

<p>I will acknowledge publicly that I believe making exactly four, one in each color and not in the fifth color (without a specific reason to do so—there have been actual reasons we purposefully made incomplete cycles in the past) is an error on our part. I'm a big believer in aesthetics and people's inherent need for pattern completion, so I get how this is going to annoy some people. Sorry about that. It truly wasn't on purpose. I can say, as the creator of Curses (inspired, interestingly enough, by <em>Un-</em> cards), I'm happy to see that we keep making more and that they're popular with certain players.</p>

<p><strong>Gisa, Glorious Resurrector </strong></p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Gisa, Glorious Resurrector" src="https://media.wizards.com/2021/mid/en_xHnK18ti3w.png" /></p>

<p>Gisa Cecani started as a character created by the <em>Innistrad </em>flavor text writers as a fun voice for Innistrad. She and her brother Geralf both created Zombies, but she did it through necromancy, the black way, and her brother did it through science, the blue way. Neither Gisa nor Geralf were in <em>Innistrad</em> block because we didn't realize the popularity their flavor text would bring them (and from a schedule standpoint, we do flavor text after most of the design is done), but finally managed to make them a shared card in <em>Eldritch Moon</em>. Gisa then got her first solo card in <em>Commander (2014 Edition)</em>.</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><auto-card>Gisa and Geralf</auto-card> <auto-card>Ghoulcaller Gisa</auto-card></p>

<p>Here's the story of her card's evolution in <em>Innistrad: Midnight Hunt</em>. First up, here's the initial design printed in this slot:</p>

<p class="mvtext"><strong>Ludevic of Ulm 2.0 (version 1)</strong><br />
2UB<br />
Legendary Creature — Human Wizard<br />
4/4<br />
4: Exile target instant or sorcery card from your graveyard. Return target creature card from your graveyard to the battlefield. It becomes a Zombie in addition to its other types and gains "Whenever this creature deals combat damage to an opponent, you may copy the exiled card and cast the copy without paying its mana cost."</p>

<p>Yes, the first card printed in this slot wasn't for Gisa at all. It was a design for Ludevic, a different Zombie maker. Ludevic did get a card, which I'll talk about next week, but it ended up being moved to another slot in the file. More on that design when we get there. So, here's the first design for this slot that was actually for Gisa:</p>

<p class="mvtext"><strong>Gisa &amp; Geralf, Spooky Siblings (version 2)</strong><br />
2BB<br />
Legendary Creature — Human Warlock<br />
4/4<br />
4, Exile an instant or sorcery card from your graveyard: Return target creature card from your graveyard to the battlefield. It becomes a Zombie in addition to its other types and gains "Whenever this creature deals combat damage to an opponent, you may copy the exiled card and cast the copy without paying its mana cost."</p>

<p>It's the same design as the original Ludevic except it was changed from a blue-black card to a mono-black card. I think the change came about partly because Ludevic was wanted for a different design and partly because the card as designed could be done as a mono-black card and didn't require any blue. (Also, technically, the card's exile cost was no longer targeted—a subtle difference, but one with rules implications.) Okay, what mono-black character raises Zombies from the graveyard? Gisa, of course. I'm not sure why this version included her brother Geralf. Geralf is clearly a blue character, and the card is mono-black. I assume this is why Geralf gets dropped from the next incarnation.</p>

<p class="mvtext"><strong>Gisa, Zombie Master (version 3)</strong><br />
2BB<br />
Legendary Creature — Human Wizard<br />
4/4<br />
Whenever a nontoken creature an opponent controls dies, return that card to the battlefield under your control. It's a black Zombie in addition to its other colors and types and gains "This creature can't block" and "When this creature deals damage, sacrifice it."</p>

<p>I believe the key reason this card got changed was because they wanted to integrate the decayed keyword as it was something specific to this set, but it also allowed them to design a card that was a little more Gisa in feel. Ludevic is more creative in his Zombie making. Gisa just enjoys making a lot of Zombies. The idea that every creature of the opponent that dies becomes a Zombie for you felt cool and the decayed mechanic allowed us to be much more aggressive with the costing. The final card basically has the same general function but makes use of the exile zone to slow the card down a little. I believe it lost making a black Zombie for rules text space limitations.</p>

<p><strong>Liesa, Forgotten Archangel</strong></p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Liesa, Forgotten Archangel" src="https://media.wizards.com/2021/mid/en_pqD77UH5Mh.png" /></p>

<p>In original <em>Innistrad</em>, we met three sister Angels—Bruna, Gisela, and Sigarda. They were all white and each had a different second color (blue, red, and green, respectively). In the short story "<a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-story/gaze-blank-and-pitiless-2016-03-09" target="_blank">A Gaze Blank and Pitiless</a>," we learned that there was a fourth sister who was white and black. As is usually the case, once we mention the existence of a new character, players ask us to make a card for them. So, in <em>Commander Legends</em>, we made [autocard]Liesa, Shroud of Dusk[/autocard].</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><auto-card>Liesa, Shroud of Dusk</auto-card></p>

<p>But we were back on Innistrad, and it turns out Liesa wasn't dead anymore (Avacyn had originally killed her—tune in to the web fiction to find out how and why she's back), so that meant we had to make a new card for her. Although, as you will see, it took a little while for us to make a card for her. Here's the first card designed for this slot:</p>

<p class="mvtext"><strong>Nadia Markov (version 1)</strong><br />
WB<br />
Legendary Creature — Vampire Noble<br />
2/3<br />
Whenever you sacrifice a creature, target opponent sacrifices a creature.</p>

<p>The first version of this card was Nadia Markov. I'm not exactly sure who she is, but obviously she's a member of the Markov clan (aka related to Sorin). It was a variant on [autocard]Grave Pact[/autocard], but instead of triggering when any of your creature dies, it just triggers when you sacrifice a creature. Vampires and creature sacrifice are a great flavor match, so it's an area we play around with in most sets that have a major Vampire component.</p>

<p class="mvtext"><strong>The Ermodun Family (version 2)</strong><br />
WB<br />
Legendary Creature — Human<br />
2/3<br />
1, Sacrifice a creature: Put a +1/+1 counter on each creature you control.</p>

<p>The next version changed a bunch of things. First, instead of a member of the Markov family, it became a whole other family, this time Human cannibals instead of Vampires. My guess on this was the Markovs play a big role in <em>Crimson Vow</em>, so I think they wanted any Markovs there. Second, instead of being a sacrifice reward, it became a card that made use of sacrifice. Third, unlike the previous design, this design has a white element to it with the +1/+1 counter effect. Nadia could have been a mono-black design. This led to the next version:</p>

<p class="mvtext"><strong>The Ermodun Family, Cannibal Clan (version 3)</strong><br />
WB<br />
Legendary Creature — Human<br />
2/3<br />
2, Sacrifice another nontoken creature: Create X 1/1 white Human creature tokens, where X is the sacrificed creature's power.</p>

<p>This next version kept the same flavor but changed the output to a different white effect, making 1/1 Humans creature tokens. This effect was a little more powerful, so they had to up its activation cost. The team wasn't happy with this design in playtest though, so they tried something very different:</p>

<p class="mvtext"><strong>Angel of Purgatory (version 4)</strong><br />
2WB<br />
Creature — Angel<br />
3/3<br />
Flying<br />
Whenever another nontoken creature you control dies, return that card to its owner's hand.</p>

<p>This version became an Angel. It protected your creatures by sending them to your hand instead of the graveyard when they die.</p>

<p class="mvtext"><strong>Liesa, Life's Burden (version 5)</strong><br />
4WB<br />
Legendary Creature — Angel<br />
5/5<br />
Flying<br />
Whenever another nontoken creature you control dies, return that card to its owner's hand at the beginning of the next end step.</p>

<p>I think this is the point where the Creative team figured out Liesa was going to be in the story and was looking for a card for her. Well, how about the white-black Angel? Once it was Liesa, that meant it had to get bigger. Her <em>Commander Legends</em> card had been a 5/5. The Set Design team also added a delay for getting the creature card back to avoid combo issues with sacrifice outlets.</p>

<p class="mvtext"><strong>Liesa the Hidden Angel (version 6)</strong><br />
2WWB<br />
Legendary Creature — Angel<br />
4/4<br />
Flying, lifelink<br />
Whenever another nontoken creature you control dies, return that card to its owner's hand at the beginning of the next end step.</p>

<p>The next version tweaked the card to make it closer to Liesa's last version. The mana cost was made to match, and she was given lifelink. To do that, they changed her from a 5/5 to a 4/5. The printed version is close to this one with two changes. She went from a 4/4 to a 4/5 and they added in a mirrored effect where the opponent's creatures can never come back when they die.</p>

Plus, before this column is over, I have a cool new preview card to show you, something for the Zombie fans out there.</p>

<h1>The Monster Squad</h1>

<p>To introduce design teams, I have the team lead do the introductions. First up, Ethan Fleischer is going to introduce the <em>Innistrad: Midnight Hunt</em> Vision Design team.</p>

	<p><strong>Ethan Fleischer (vision lead)</strong></p>

	<p>I've been designing <em>Magic</em> sets for about ten years now, including recent sets like <em>Kaldheim</em> and <em>Modern Horizons 2</em>. I brought my love of classic film to bear on this, the sixth set on Innistrad. If you think you see a reference to German expressionism in there somewhere, it's really there. I think my favorite actor has got to be Lon Chaney Jr.; there's just something so sympathetic about the roles he plays.</p>

	<p><strong>Doug Beyer (creative lead)</strong></p>

	<p>Doug is the creative director for <em>Magic</em>, but he's an accomplished game designer as well. One of his recent brainchildren was <em>Jumpstart</em>. Doug took the ideas that the Vision Design team had and transformed them into an exciting storyline, which influenced the worldbuilding of the set. Doug is always great to work with, but sometimes his breath smells like raw meat.</p>

	<p><strong>George Fan (designer emeritus)</strong></p>

	<p>George is a game designer with some impressive credits under his belt, including <em>Plants vs. Zombies</em> and <em>Octogeddon</em>. He took a contract position to design <em>Magic</em> with us for twelve months, bringing a lot of exciting new ideas to the teams he was on. George is one of the sweetest guys I have ever met. Every few weeks, he practically begged us to lock him into one of the conference rooms; "For your own safety," he said. How considerate is that?</p>

	<p><strong>Ari Nieh</strong></p>

	<p>Ari was the winner of the<em> Great Designer Search 3</em> and has quickly risen to leading design teams of her own, which you all will get to see before too much more time has passed. Ari's solid understanding of design principles and <em>Magic</em>'s best practices served her well on <em>Innistrad: Midnight Hunt</em>'s Vision Design team. However, whenever someone would suggest a multirole card design that would serve as a "silver bullet" to solve several problems as once, Ari would wince and look decidedly uncomfortable. I have no idea what that was all about.</p>

	<p><strong>James Rose</strong></p>

	<p>During the day, James works on the <em>MTG Arena</em> team as a user experience designer. During the night, he is one of <em>Magic</em> design's best-kept secrets. He has become one of my go-to designers to have on my teams. His schedule was always a bit erratic, though; every full moon, he would spend his nights roaming the moors. Managing these kinds of quirks is all part of leading a team of creative people.</p>

	<p><strong>Mark Rosewater</strong></p>

	<p>Mark is the head designer for all of <em>Magic</em>. His experience leading vision design for the original<em> Innistrad </em>and his general media savviness made him an invaluable addition to the team. Normally, Mark wears a different tee shirt every day, and each week had a theme that we'd try to guess. Once or twice a month, Mark shows up at work looking exhausted, wearing nothing but a pair of ragged pants. This makes guessing the theme for that week especially challenging.</p>

	<p><strong>James Wyatt (creative lead emeritus)</strong></p>

	<p>James currently works on <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>, but during <em>Innistrad: Midnight Hunt</em>'s vision design, he was a member of <em>Magic</em>'s Worldbuilding team. James is a longtime veteran writer of tabletop games. He ushered <em>Innistrad: Midnight Hunt</em>'s worldbuilding through the early stages before handing the reigns over to Doug Beyer. James's mane of hair is barely restrained, and he usually has a lupine gleam in his eyes, but I'm sure there's nothing suspicious about that.</p>

	<p><strong>Ian Duke (co-set lead)</strong></p>

	<p><em>Innistrad: Midnight Hunt</em> marks my first set design lead role in a few years, so, naturally, I'm super excited for its release. I previously lead <em>Oath of the</em> <em>Gatewatch</em>, <em>Kaladesh</em>, and <em>Hour of Devastation</em> (as well as several non-Standard releases) before taking a hiatus to help spin up the Play Design team as its initial technical lead. During that time, I also served as a strong second experienced designer for the leads of <em>Dominaria</em>, <em>Guilds of</em> <em>Ravnica</em>, <em>War of the Spark</em>, <em>Throne of</em> <em>Eldraine</em>, <em>Theros Beyond Death</em>, and <em>Zendikar</em> <em>Rising</em>, so I managed to keep from becoming rusty on the card design front. I've traditionally specialized in working on game balance and format health, and that experience and skillset translates well to many of the tasks a design lead needs to manage.</p>

	<p><strong>Erik</strong> <strong>Lauer</strong><strong> (co-set lead)</strong></p>

	<p>Erik and I were co-leads for <em>Innistrad: Midnight Hunt</em>, with Erik receiving the vision design handoff from Ethan and leading the first half of set design while I led the final portion. Erik is one of our most seasoned and skilled design leads, with over a decade of experience. He is uniquely talented at the structural portion of set design, making sure that the set themes and mechanics play well and complement each other to create a cohesive whole. Erik's work paved the way for the second half of set design very well, as most of the foundation that Erik set in place held through to the final product.</p>

	<p><strong>Mark Gottlieb</strong></p>

	<p>Another experienced veteran, Mark Gottlieb stands out as one of the best designers at coming up with novel mechanics and individual card designs. Mark contributed a tremendous number of designs that made it into the final set. He was a great help as a strong second to me once Erik handed off, as Mark's intuition for what makes an awesome <em>Magic</em> set and ability to keep designs simple and elegant always kept us on course. I'd worked closely with Mark recently on <em>Theros Beyond Death</em>, and he's always one of my favorite people to be on a design team with.</p>

	<p><strong>Ari Nieh</strong></p>

	<p>Ari's work on the set predated my taking over as lead, but we did have a bit of overlap working together as Set Design team members. Ari did great work helping to fill out the early card file as the team experimented with themes and mechanics. As the person in charge of white's color pie, Ari was a great resource for the me and team during a time when the studio was actively trying to expand white's portion of the color pie and its power level in various formats.</p>

	<p><strong>Reggie Valk</strong></p>

	<p>One of the newer folks among the Studio X designers (at least at the time of our work on <em>Innistrad: Midnight Hunt</em>), Reggie brought a fresh perspective as a <em>Magic</em> mega-fan just coming in from the "wilds" of outside Wizards's walls. He's one of the most passionate designers I've had the pleasure of working with and contributed many card designs that made it into the final file. Reggie joined the <em>Innistrad: Midnight Hunt</em> team before I did and ended up being the Set Design team member with the longest continuous involvement. He was great at filling me in with why earlier decisions had been made and what alternatives had been tested so we could move forward without slipping into previous pitfalls.</p>

	<p><strong>Melissa DeTora</strong></p>

	<p>For most of my stretch as set lead, Melissa was our resident play designer, assigned to specialize in game balance aspects of set design. In addition to helping us tweak and tune numbers and power level, she also contributed numerous card designs. Melissa has a great knack for identifying which cards and play patterns are fun and which are not, helping us weed out card designs that were trading off too much fun for the sake of novelty or cleverness.</p>

	<p><strong>Michael Majors</strong></p>

	<p>Before Melissa joined the team, Michael was the play designer assisting Erik during the earlier portions of set design. While I wouldn't end up working with Michael directly on the set until the Standard testing stages, his early file comments and balance work set up the set for a great handoff from Erik to myself. Michael is one of our most experienced play designers at working on various Constructed formats, and he helped ensure the set had plenty of great well-balanced designs for Standard, Modern, Commander, and beyond.</p>

	<p><strong>Andrew Brown</strong></p>

	<p>Andrew is my successor as play design technical lead, and these days, he often hops on each Set Design team toward the end of the process to help shepherd it into our Standard format playtesting process, otherwise known as "Future Future League" (FFL). Andrew and I worked closely together to balance the card file for both competitive and casual play alike. He also set the full force of the Play Design team to work on playtesting the Limited format, especially Booster Draft, to give the set one final round of balance and polish.</p>

	<p><strong>John Penick</strong></p>

	<p>John is a designer with strong game-balance skills who had worked on and off with the Play Design team as well as on a variety of other game projects. He joined us toward the end of set design as part of a cross-disciplinary exchange. I greatly appreciated having John's fresh perspective and game-balance experience, and he helped us with many of the finishing touches.</p>

<h1>Making Monsters</h1>

<p>While Werewolves are the focus of this set, it's still Innistrad, which means there are four other major creature types to care about.</p>

<p><strong>Zombies</strong></p>

<p>One of the challenges of designing Zombies on Innistrad is our desire to capture the pop culture feel of Zombies. In movies and on television, Zombies aren't particularly scary in the singular. They're not that fast, they're not that smart. If you're prepared for them and you know how to kill them, it's not that difficult to deal with a single zombie. What makes Zombies scary is that there's never just one. There's always a horde of Zombies that follow the first one you encounter, and there are only so many you can fight before they overwhelm you. We've always tried to capture that feel in Innistrad sets, that it's the horde that's going to kill you.</p>

<p>During <em>Innistrad: Crimson Vow</em> vision design, we decided to explore what other resources might be available to capture this feeling. We looked at Zombie creature tokens, always 2/2 black Zombies, and asked if there was another way to use them. Some of my favorite Zombie cards from original <em>Innistrad </em>allowed you to acquire a large amount of Zombie creature tokens to overrun the opponent, but it wasn't the kind of thing we could do easily at low rarities. Was there a way to create a Zombie horde at common and uncommon? That was the task we set out to solve.</p>

<p>We started by asking if we could just do more Zombie creature token creation at low rarities. What if there were spells that created a Zombie as an add-on to the spell—it was a creature that came with a Zombie creature token or an instant or sorcery that made one in addition to its effect. The problem was that we'd locked in Zombies as being 2/2 creature tokens (and that started long before original <em>Innistrad</em>), and it was too big of an effect to add on without significantly raising the mana cost of the spells. That's when we came up with a novel idea. What if we gave the Zombie tokens a downside to make them weaker to allow us to include them on spells?</p>

<p>The biggest problem tokens create is that they gum up the board and keep the opponent's creatures from attacking. Okay, we'll add "can't block." We tried that, and it was still too good. We then asked ourselves what kind of play pattern we wanted. We liked the idea of slowly building up your Zombie army and winning the game by attacking with a horde. That was exactly the flavor we wanted to capture. That led us to the drawback "when it attacks, sacrifice it at the end of combat." The idea was that each Zombie token basically had one attack. You wanted to save it until it was the right time to use it. Playtesting showed us that sometimes it was in a horde but that at other times it was finding an opportunity when you can get through. This way, your opponent had to treat the Zombie creature tokens as a potential threat.</p>

<p>During development, they ended up keywording that ability as decayed. Now I realize that drawback mechanics aren't historically popular, so it's easy to say, why should I be excited for creature tokens that are way worse than normal? Because it allows us to give them to you at a much cheaper cost and it creates a new play pattern that's very interesting. Much of the team was skeptical at first, but as we played them, everyone fell in love with them because they're flavorful and impactful in a way that's not always obvious at first blush. They ended up being so popular in R&amp;D, in fact, that the <em>Innistrad: Midnight Hunt</em> Set Design team decided to move forward with the mechanic. (Set Design teams can use future mechanics as needed because the future design team has more time to find a replacement.) Every Zombie creature token in the set has decayed. I know this mechanic is probably going to create some skepticism at first glance, but I promise you, it plays well.</p>

<p>Before I move on, my preview card today is a card that uses decayed. Click below to see Tainted Adversary.</p>

	<p>Tainted Adversary is part of a mythic rare cycle of creatures, each with a keyword and the ability to pay mana as an enters-the-battlefield effect to create both +1/+1 counters on the creature and another in-color effect.</p>

<p><strong>Spirits</strong></p>

<p>Two weeks ago, I showed you the <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/innistrad-design-handoff-document-2021-08-23" target="_blank">design handoff document from original <em>Innistrad</em></a>, and in the article, I noted that I felt Spirits deserved more of a mechanical identity than they received. <em>Innistrad: Midnight Hunt</em> does not suffer from that problem. In fact, we gave them a whole new mechanic. Let me explain how it happened.</p>

<p>While trying to figure out how best to make use of transforming double-faced cards (TDFCs), we explored other facets of how we could use them to represent transformation. Part of this exploration was to look at each of the five main creature types and figure out what kind of transformation made the best flavor sense. For Spirits, the thing that stood out was that they didn't start out as Spirits. At one point, they were alive, but when they died, they became Spirits. That's a cool transformation. The earliest version of this involved creatures with a death trigger that put them back on the battlefield transformed. It turned out that having a creature die into another creature was strong, so we ended up making cards that looked very weak. That's when we thought about the aftermath mechanic from <em>Amonkhet</em> block, where you played the card as one spell from your hand but as a different spell from your graveyard. What if we combined aftermath with flashback to make cards that could be cast as one creature from your hand and a different creature, always a Spirit, from your graveyard.</p>

<p>This led us to create a mechanic, what we called disturb, that allowed you to cast the card from the graveyard and have it enter the battlefield transformed. As this was the Spirit mechanic that was trying to capture the transformation I talked about above, the front side is always a living creature, usually a Human, and the backside is always a Spirit. This way, you get the flavor of things dying and then returning as Spirits. The flavor was great, and it allowed us to use TDFCs in a new way. I do want to mention two other things. One, not every Spirit in the set has disturb, but the majority do. Two, the Vision Design team created a different mechanic for the Spirits, but when <em>Innistrad: Midnight Hunt</em> took the decayed Zombie creature tokens from <em>Innistrad: Crimson Vow</em>, they traded them the Spirit mechanic (as each made more mechanical sense in the other set). I'll talk about that Spirit mechanic when I do my <em>Innistrad: Crimson Vow</em> preview articles.</p>

<p><strong>Humans</strong></p>

<p>As is most often the case, things aren't going so well for the Humans of Innistrad. Oddly, being surrounded by monsters isn't the safest thing. Some of the Humans have turned to witchcraft to protect themselves from the monsters (in particular, the Werewolves in the story), and we wanted to find a mechanic to capture the flavor of witchcraft. To do their witchcraft, the Humans have banded together at an event called the Harvesttide.</p>

<p>Since original <em>Innistrad</em>, the Humans' two biggest strengths have been their willingness to work together and their adaptability. We were hoping the witchcraft mechanic could play both these up. The first version we tried was a kicker-like mechanic where you could tap three creatures to enhance the spell. Tapping creatures ended up being too much of a cost, so we tried to approach the problem from a different vantage point. What if the spell just required three creatures, sort of a creature version of metalcraft from <em>Scars of Mirrodin</em> (which was a threshold mechanic that required three artifacts). That ended up being a little too easy. What if you had to have three creatures but they had to have something in common?</p>

<p>Sharing the same creature type? It was already the Human mechanic, so that wasn't really asking for enough.</p>

<p>Sharing the same mana value? It seemed like an odd thing to care about and wasn't particularly flavorful.</p>

<p>Sharing the same power? This one was a little more interesting but was too easily solved with 1/1 creature tokens.</p>

<p>That's when the design team decided to flip the requirement. What if instead of sharing the same power, you had to have three creatures each with a different power? This was a task that was a little more complicated, so it couldn't be done too easily but was doable enough that it could be accomplished. The ability ended up being called coven. It mostly went on creatures but was also able to go on other card types. (Non-creature spells get a little more of a boost, as the creature gives you one of the three creatures you need.)</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Candlelit Cavalry" src="https://media.wizards.com/2021/mid/en_MFQZeq2IGO.png" /></p>

<p><strong>Vampires</strong></p>

<p><em>Innistrad: </em><em>Crimson Vow</em> is to Vampires what <em>Innistrad: Midnight Hunt</em> is to Werewolves, so of all the tribes in the set, Vampires was the one we were least worried about. The next set was going to have lots of goodies for the Vampire fans. <em>Innistrad: Midnight Hunt</em> was still going to have Vampires as a viable Draft archetype/Constructed deck theme, so we wanted to make sure they had a mechanical identity; it just didn't need to be a named mechanic. What we ended up with was a theme. Many of the Vampires have triggers that care about if your opponent has lost life during your turn. This could come from damaging them with creatures or spells, something black and red can do. It also plays nicely with Vampires from other sets.</p>

<p><strong>Devils</strong></p>

<p><em>Innistrad</em> was the first set to have multiple Devils in it. <em>Innistrad: Midnight Hunt</em> has two Devil cards and one card that creates Devil tokens (and yes, they're 1/1s that deal 1 damage to any target when they die).</p>

<h1>And the Rest</h1>

<p>Part of returning to a world for the third time is that there are some expectations to meet, and the design teams worked hard to fit in as much as they could. Here are some returning things in <em>Innistrad: Midnight Hunt</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Flashback</strong></p>

<p>Flashback first premiered in <em>Odyssey</em> but was a big part of the success of original <em>Innistrad</em>. While our second return to the plane didn't include them, we decided our third visit should. (And yes, this is why they weren't in <em>Strixhaven</em>.) There are a whole bunch of new flashback cards.</p>

<p><strong>Curses</strong></p>

<p><em>Innistrad</em> introduced Curses, Auras that enchanted players and gave them negative abilities. <em>Innistrad: Midnight Hunt</em> has four new ones.</p>

<p><strong>Transformation</strong></p>

<p>Transforming double-faced cards are a staple of Innistrad sets (well, other than <em>Avacyn Restored</em>), so obviously <em>Innistrad: Midnight Hunt</em> has a bunch. In fact, two cards in every <em>Innistrad: Midnight Hunt</em> booster should be TDFCs. And yes, most of them have daybound/nightbound or disturb, but there are a number of other cards that transform in different ways.</p>

<p><strong>The Graveyard</strong></p>

<p>What would a gothic horror plane be without a lot of references to the graveyard? It's been a staple of previous visits to Innistrad, and this time is no exception. In addition to flashback and disturb (two mechanics that work in the graveyard), there are a lot of other individual cards that reference it in various ways.</p>

<p><strong>Investigate</strong></p>

<p>Investigate (and Clues) was a popular mechanic from <em>Shadows over Innistrad</em>, so we've included five new ones.</p>

<p><strong>The Number Thirteen</strong></p>

<p>Thirteen is a superstitiously unlucky number, so Innistrad sets like to make use of the number in rules text. Three different cards reference the number thirteen.</p>

I'm going to start telling you the story of the set's design and show off a cool new preview card (it's a Werewolf!). You know, business as usual, except with more Werewolves. I guess business as usual in Innistrad.</p>

<h1>Where the Wolves Are</h1>

<p>Our story today starts all the way back in the summer of 1994. There was a new set coming out called<em> Legends</em>. That meant that I had to camp out in front of the game store for an hour before it opened because I'd learned that if you don't buy a <em>Magic</em> set the day it comes out, it becomes a lot harder to get your hands on it. I'd found a game store in Westwood, the city where UCLA is, that had ordered a lot of <em>Legends</em>, so that was where I went to buy mine. I ended up buying four booster boxes, three of which I opened that day and one which I put away in a closet. One of the cards I opened was this one:</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><auto-card>Lesser Werewolf</auto-card></p>

<p>I remember reading the name and getting excited. <em>Ooh, what's a <auto-card>Lesser Werewolf</auto-card>?</em> But then I read the rules text. <em>Okay, if I have enough mana, I could use it to kill a blocker or an attacker while blocking</em>. But why temporarily reduce its power? And what exactly in the design conveyed the idea of transformation? It just felt like a swing and a miss, which was disappointing because I really wanted <em>Magic</em> to have a cool Werewolf.</p>

<p>Let's go forward a little less than a year to early 1995. I was freelancing for Wizards writing various things for seven different parts of the company (which included both R&amp;D and <em>The Duelist</em>) when I got an interesting email. Was I interested in starting an external playtest group? I would need to put together a play group of four to eight individuals to be sent playtesting material for upcoming sets. All we had to do was play with it, collect notes on our playtest, and send them back to R&amp;D. I said yes, that was something I would like to do.</p>

<p>I got a bunch of my <em>Magic</em> friends from Los Angles together (it's where I was living at the time), and we made a playtest group. The first set we were sent to playtest was <em>Homelands</em>. The playtest cards were pieces of cardboard that had been printed out and cut into roughly the shape of a <em>Magic</em> card (although a little shorter and squatter). The first thing we did at our very first meeting was open up the box of playtest cards and look at them. One of the first cards I looked at was this card.</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><auto-card>Greater Werewolf</auto-card></p>

<p>I was very excited when I read the name. <em><auto-card>Greater Werewolf</auto-card></em>. That had to be better than <auto-card>Lesser Werewolf</auto-card>. I enthusiastically shouted, "It's a Werewolf!"</p>

<p>Then I read the card. Five mana for a 2/4 that permanently harmed creatures that blocked it. "Oh," I said, "it sucks." I looked through the rest of the set eager to find another Werewolf, but none were to be found. <em>Magic </em>was now zero for two with Werewolves.</p>

<p>Fast-forward to 2000. I was now working in R&amp;D at Wizards and was on the design team for <em>Judgment</em>. It was the third set in the <em>Odyssey </em>block, and we were experimenting with different types of designs with one of the block's mechanics, threshold. One idea we were playing with was having a few threshold creatures that were double-edged swords when you reached threshold. Yes, they got better, but there was some danger built into the transformation. This resulted in the following card making it to print:</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><auto-card>Treacherous Werewolf</auto-card></p>

<p>The card wasn't designed to be a top-down Werewolf. We'd used lycanthropy as a flavor for some of the threshold cards, so the Creative team felt this might be a good place to make a Werewolf. It was clearly a better card than the first two Werewolves (it at least incorporated transformation), but it still was far from a slam-dunk design.</p>

<p>Fast-forward to 2009. It's early in the design of original <em>Innistrad</em>. We'd decided that we wanted creatures that were monsters and that had to include Vampires, Zombies, and Werewolves (Spirits got added a little later). I was eager to figure out top-down designs for each of our monsters.</p>

<p>I started that meeting by pulling out copies of <auto-card>Lesser Werewolf</auto-card>, <auto-card>Greater Werewolf</auto-card>, and <auto-card>Treacherous Werewolf</auto-card> from my pocket. "These are the Werewolves of <em>Magic</em>. We can do better. In fact, I think the key to whether this set is going to be a success is if we can figure out how to execute well on Werewolf cards. <em>Magic</em>'s done Vampires successfully. <em>Magic</em>'s done Zombies successfully. But it hasn't succeeded with Werewolves yet. This is where we're going to focus our energies today."</p>

<p>I ended up making a bunch of rules that defined what a Werewolf had to do (two states, transformation, etc.—you can read more about it in <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/were-wild-things-are-2011-10-03">my article from Werewolf Week</a>). This would lead to Tom LaPille suggesting we make use of the double-sided card technology that <em>Duel Masters</em> (the Japanese TCG that Wizards makes) was using. We did, and you all have probably heard me tell that story twenty times.</p>

<p>Today's story goes down a different path. There were numerous ideas suggested, not just double-faced cards. One of the main mechanics in the set (and one on my preview card today) got its origin in something I pitched as a possible way to solve the Werewolf issue other than using double-faced cards.</p>

<p>I called my idea day/night. Here's how it worked. When you played a Werewolf, you went and fetched a card from outside the game (yes, while <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Adventures in the Forgotten Realms</em> finally did this with dungeons, we've been playing with this idea for a long time). It involved a double-sided card with one side representing day and the other side representing night. Each side had a track with three spots on it. You'd start on the first spot on the day side. Then, every time a player casted a spell, the track would advance. When they were on spots one, two, and three, it would be day, and when they were on spots four, five, and six, it would be night. The player would move from spot six to spot one, and the Werewolves would change their side based on whether it was day or night.</p>

<p>The mechanic played well, but it just wasn't as exciting as double-faced cards, so we ended up pulling it from the set. However, it was the inspiration for the "Werewolf mechanic" (the trigger that transformed Humans into Werewolves and Werewolves into Humans) we put in <em>Innistrad</em> and has appeared on all Werewolves since (with the sole exception of <em>Eldritch Moon</em>, which did them a little differently). I honestly didn't think we'd ever see the day/night mechanic again, but the past does have a way of turning up when you least expect it.</p>

<h1>What a Hackathon</h1>

<p>Fast-forward another bunch of years, this time to 2018. In 2017, R&amp;D had started doing something called Hackathons where we took the week off from our normal responsibilities and used the time to brainstorm ideas for future products. Both <em>Modern Horizons</em> and <em>Jumpstart </em>were a byproduct of the first Hackathon. Seeing how successful the first Hackathon had been, I asked permission to do a Hackathon on future <em>Magic</em> mechanics. I ended up running the Hackathon, and I did so by breaking up the ideas into six different categories.</p>

<p><strong>Team #1: Planeswalkers</strong> – This team explored doing some bottom-up planeswalker designs to find cool mechanical hooks that we could later find characters for.</p>

<p><strong>Team #2: Story Beats</strong> – This team looked at upcoming story beats to figure out if we could use those as jumping-off points to inspire new designs.</p>

<p><strong>Team #3: Reexamining Old Assumptions</strong> – This team went back and reexamined decisions <em>Magic</em> had made in its past to explore what might have happened if we had made a different decision. Might there be cool mechanics if we were willing to question old choices?</p>

<p><strong>Team #4: Backlog Mechanics</strong> – This team looked at all the mechanics we'd tried but hadn't used to see if there were cool mechanics buried in the work of our past.</p>

<p><strong>Team #5: Frames</strong> – This team explored the potential that came with our new willingness to be more aggressive with alternate frames. Were there mechanics that we couldn't have done before but now could using frame design as a resource.</p>

<p><strong>Team #6:</strong> <strong>Outside Components </strong>– This team explored mechanics that required you having components beyond your deck of cards.</p>

<p>I found my five other team leaders and let them pick which team they wanted to run. I ended up leading Team #6 because it was the most "out of the box" team and no one else knew quite what to make of it. Within my team, I subdivided ideas into the different categories I was interested in exploring.</p>

<p>I don't want to get too deep into the subcategories, as some of them involve cool stuff coming down the road, but I will talk about one subsection, what I called "external cards." The idea of this section asks how we can use a card from the deck to bring another card to the game from outside the deck. Those cards didn't necessarily have to be traditional <em>Magic</em> cards but any component that could be printed on a card. Dungeons are a good example of a printed mechanic from this category.</p>

<p>To help get the team's creative juices flowing, I started by doing a talk where I ran through all the things that we'd tried in the past but hadn't done in this category. One of those things was the day/night mechanic from original <em>Innistrad</em>. When I talked about it, other team members were intrigued by it, so we decided to spend some time messing around with it to see what kind of designs we could make.</p>

<p>One of the big innovations was the idea that if you had this component, you could do more than just transforming double-faced cards. There could be plenty of one-sided cards that either turned on or off or changed their function depending on whether it was day or night. The more we played with it, the more we enjoyed it, so in the final presentation for the team (each team gave a presentation at a Tuesday <em>Magic</em> meeting about what they had discovered—they did a write-up as well), I pitched day/night as a possible future mechanic with potential.</p>

<h1>Start the <em>Hunt</em></h1>

<p>Fast-forward a little over a year later, and I'm at the first meeting of vision design for <em>Innistrad: Midnight Hunt</em>. We're talking about things we could do for our third trip to Innistrad, and I say, "I have something—something that owes its very existence to the world of Innistrad." I pull out the decks for the mechanic we'd made during the Hackathon and play them with the team.</p>

<p>Ethan Fleischer, who was the lead vision designer of the set, said he liked the cards that cared about day/night and liked the basic structure but was skeptical of the flip condition. (While many things had changed, it still had a track that moved as spells were cast.) He suggested we try some other triggers and see how they played.</p>

<p>So, we did. We made a long list of different triggers we could care about and playtested various versions. One thing we tried involved using the same trigger the Werewolves already use. Not only would it be easier to remember, as the "Werewolf mechanic" is pretty integral to most Innistrad sets, but it would also allow all the old Werewolves (again, except the ones from <em>Eldritch Moon</em>) to play similarly to the ones in this set. Once we playtested it, it became instantly apparent that's what we should be using.</p>

<p>Once we had the day/night mechanic, which would be changed to daybound/nightbound, we started exploring what kinds of things it would let us do. There ended up being four major areas.</p>

<p><strong>1. It could tie other transformations to the Werewolves.</strong></p>

<p>While most of the daybound/nightbound cards would be Werewolves, it allowed us to take other cards that thematically connect and also have them link to the daybound/nightbound cycle. For example, for the first time, you'll see some other card types change at the same time as Werewolves transform.</p>

<p><strong>2. We could make non-transforming cards care.</strong></p>

<p>Daybound/nightbound creates a state that other cards can care about, even ones that don't transform. For example, we can make cards that get stronger based on whether it's day or night. In design, we tried both, but Set Design found that the flavor leaned on things being more powerful at night.</p>

<p><strong>3. We can care about the transformation itself.</strong></p>

<p>Another thing we found fun in playtesting was that we can create cards, and ultimately a deck archetype, that doesn't care about it being day or night specifically but triggers whenever it changes from one to another. While it's fun making a deck that works hard at constantly making it night (this is mostly how Werewolf decks play), it's also fun to create a deck that's trying to switch it as much as possible. This theme shows up in white, blue, and red.</p>

<p><strong>4. Things can enter on the nightbound side.</strong></p>

<p>Daybound/nightbound also has one other interesting quirk. The mechanic allows cards to sense which state it is in when they enter the battlefield and transform accordingly. That means, for example, if you're playing a Werewolf deck, and it's night, your Werewolves will enter on their Werewolf side. (I should point out that the old Werewolves that don't have daybound/nightbound won't do this, although they will still transform at the same time as the daybound/nightbound ones, so the cards will play together well.)</p>

<p>I do want to stress that just because daybound/nightbound exists, that doesn't mean that all the transforming double-faced cards (TDFCs) are connected to it. In fact, there's an entire other mechanic, which I'll get into next week, that we tied into TDFCs. Part of the fun of visiting Innistrad is exploring what we can do with TDFCs, and while the Werewolves are back in force, there are plenty of TDFCs doing other things.</p>

<p>Once we realized that daybound/nightbound was going to be a key component of the set, we decided it would be fun to lean into Werewolves as a theme. As I explained above, Vampires, Zombies, and Spirits get a lot more face time on other worlds, so Innistrad is the place where we can give Werewolves some extra love. One of the ways we did this, beyond just printing more Werewolves than any previous Innistrad set, was by allowing them to exist outside their normal home of red and green (those two colors are still their primary colors). We decided that we would give them a third color option and give the remaining two colors a cameo (i.e., one card that transformed into a Werewolf). It didn't take much talking to realize that the obvious third color for Werewolves to appear in was black, so you'll find three black Werewolves in the set. White and blue each got one card that is their color on the front but transforms into either a red or green Werewolf on the back.</p>

<p>It turns out one of the cards, the white one, is my preview card today. So, without further ado, I think it's time to meet Brutal Cathar.</p>

</div>

<p>You'll notice we split the difference on the back between what overlapped and what didn't in red and white. Both colors have first strike, but white normally has ward for mana while red has ward for life. This allowed it to have a red feel while still working with a white mana cost. While I'm not showing the blue Werewolf cameo today, I can say it transforms into a green Werewolf.</p>

<p>For those worried that we wouldn't give enough goodies to the other main creature types (Human, Spirit, Vampire, and Zombie), fear not. Humans and Spirits each have a new mechanic, Zombies get a new type of Zombie token, and Vampires have an unnamed mechanical theme (and remember, Vampires get their own focused set in <em>Crimson Blood</em>). I'll walk through all that next week.</p>

<h1>It's a Full Moon Tonight</h1>

This includes talking about larger goals, themes, mechanics, and structure. I started showing these off years ago, and they were a big hit, so now whenever we get to a set where I led the vision design, I share the document. Here are the ones I've previously published:</p>

<p>"Lacrosse" is our return to New Phyrexia. It's the penultimate chapter in the Phyrexian war storyline. The challenge of this set was to deliver on the world of New Phyrexia in a way that satisfies the needs of our enfranchised fans, who are very familiar with the Phyrexians, and our less-enfranchised fans, many of whom are unaware of what the Phyrexians are (while they hit a major horror trope, they are a unique <em>Magic</em> creation, and thus a little less resonant in a vacuum). This led to the following goals for the set:</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">There was a big worry at Wizards that a Phyrexian storyline might be off-putting to some portion of the audience for two main reasons. One, their imagery can be intense. Two, they're a <em>Magic</em> creation, which means that some of our audience won't be familiar with them. Those two concerns were front and center in the creation of <em>Phyrexia: All Will</em> <em>Be One</em>, with the first item more of a worry for the art department. This led us to the decision that we'd only have one set where the Phyrexians would make up most of the set. Everywhere else, they would be present, but in smaller doses.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>1. Deliver on a set that captures the essence of the Phyrexians mechanically. </strong></p>

<p>The Phyrexians are <em>Magic</em>'s oldest villain (first showing up in <em>Antiquities</em>, the game's second expansion) and have appeared in numerous sets over the years. We've made many mechanical connections to the Phyrexians, and "Lacrosse" vision design had to figure out which ones would lead to the best set while also meeting player expectations. Our goal was to capture the promise of a "Phyrexian set."</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">As I explained in my initial design article, I'm a huge fan of the Phyrexians and chose to lead this set's vision design because I knew making Phyrexian fans happy without upsetting the players who didn't like them or weren't familiar with them was a tricky tightrope for design to walk.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>2. Design a set that is approachable to players who might be unfamiliar with the Phyrexians. </strong></p>

<p>The trick to this goal is designing a set that feels cohesive and flavorful unto itself. Part of doing this included recognizing the trope space we were playing in, what we dubbed "alien horror," where the threat is something otherworldly and invasive. We used creatures like the aliens from the <em>Alien</em> franchise, the Borg from <em>Star Trek,</em> and the body snatchers from <em>Invasion of the Body Snatchers</em> as inspiration to tap into a new type of horror (in contrast to the more traditional gothic horror that <em>Innistrad</em> sets play with), one where an alien threat acts like a virus infecting those it comes into contact with. TV Tropes dubs this trope "The Assimilator."</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">In the early days, we could just pick broad themes. <em>Innistrad </em>was the horror set that could capture all the horror tropes. As we make more and more worlds, we're finding we need to find subsections of popular genres, such as horror. We talked about this early in design. What type of horror could this set be without stepping on the toes of <em>Innistrad</em>? Leaning into the archetype that the Phyrexians are based on got us to thinking of this set as "science-fiction horror."</p>
</div>

<p><strong>3. Give the players a chance to feel the joy of playing the Phyrexians.</strong></p>

<p>In the past, the Phyrexians have always been set up as "the other," the villain you're facing. Because this set represents a world conquered by the Phyrexians and is primarily filled by Phyrexians (they account for around 80 percent of the creatures in the set), we wanted the set to give players a chance to sample what it's like to be the Phyrexians. While we were mostly using mechanics the audience was familiar with (to meet the first goal), it was important for us to create an overall environment that felt new and fresh. The novelty of this set is not the component pieces, but how they fit together to create an environment the players haven't experienced before.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">When I was leading the design for <em>Dark Ascension</em>, I was very focused on capturing the feel of the humans. From a storytelling standpoint, they were the protagonists. But Tom LaPille, the lead developer for the set (this is before the vision design, set design, and play design model), reminded me that the coolest thing about the set was the monsters, not the humans. Because of that lesson, I always try to focus on the coolest thing about the set and whether it will be fun for players to be that thing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Knowing that <em>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</em> was going to be mostly Phyrexians, I wanted the design to capture fun aspects of being Phyrexian. This meant it had to have a style of play and a feel that was joyous in the execution of using the cards. It was going to feel villainous, but it had to do so in a fun way. This was another tricky task for the design teams.</p>
</div>

<p>Here are the mechanics the Vision Design team has put into the set:</p>

<h3>Poison</h3>

<p><em>Scars of Mirrodin</em> block strongly connected the Phyrexians with the poison alternative-win condition (you lose the game when you get ten poison counters), as it played into the Phyrexians-as-disease metaphor. The Vision Design team felt the audience expectation for poison would be high enough that we were obligated to find a way to make it work in the set. Our goal was to figure out how to use poison while solving some of the issues <em>Scars of Mirrodin </em>block had with it.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">The infect mechanic was both flavorful and polarizing. While we spent a little time looking at infect in early vision design, I knew in my heart that it was unlikely to make it to print. My bigger goal was to find a way to salvage poison. I'm a huge fan of alternative-win conditions, and there's something about poison that makes it feel special.</p>
</div>

<p>The biggest problem was the "silo issue." Because creatures with infect dealt poison in place of damage, it was difficult to mix poison and non-poison strategies. You tended to go all in on one strategy and avoid the other. We wanted to find ways where poison and non-poison could mix within deck strategies. We found three ways to do this:</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;"><em>Scars of Mirrodin</em> had a lot more proliferate in it as a way to create more crossover between the two sides, but we had to scale it down for play design reasons.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>1. Using poisonous rather than infect</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Corrupted Tyrannax</strong><br />
3G<br />
Creature — Phyrexian Beast<br />
3/3<br />
Poisonous 2 <em>(Whenever this creature deals combat damage to a player, that player gets two poison counters.)</em><br />
Trample</p>

<p>Poisonous N is a creature mechanic that gives a player N poison counters whenever it deals combat damage. Unlike infect, poisonous does not replace the damage but grants poison in addition to it. This means that a player is still damaging an opponent along the way while trying to poison them to death. Also, because the poisonous number is a knob that can be adjusted, Set Design and Play Design have more control over the ratio of damage to poison.</p>

<p>We put poisonous in black, green, and white. We chose black and green, as those are the natural fits for poison, and white to represent Elesh Norn's leadership (and it works well with white's creature-heavy nature). One of our ways to help white with a "go wide" poison strategy was to allow it to create a new creature token, a 1/1 Phyrexian Mite creature token with poisonous 1 and "can't block."</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">It's interesting how little changed between the vision design handoff and print with poisonous. Yes, it became toxic for digital and creative reasons, but the gameplay is almost identical. The three poison colors remained the same, as did their basic strategic framework. The Mites even made it all the way through, not only with the same design but the same name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Another thing I want to point out is how important it is to keep Play Design's ability to balance the mechanics in mind. An idea can sound cool in a vacuum, but if we can't practically make it, it's not a good option.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>2. The use of the corrupted mechanic</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Dross Marauder</strong><br />
1B<br />
Creature — Phyrexian Warrior<br />
2/1<br />
Poisonous 1 <em>(Whenever this creature deals combat damage to a player, that player gets a poison counter.)</em><br />
<em>Corrupted</em> — As long as an opponent has 3 or more poison counters, CARDNAME gets +1/+2.</p>

<p>Corrupted is an ability word that means "If any opponent has three or more poison counters," the permanent or spell is upgraded. Its goal is to make an environment where poisoning someone is not all or nothing. There will be decks that want to poison an opponent but not kill them with poison. The Vision Design team explored different thresholds but found that three seemed to be the sweet spot. The corrupted mechanic shows up in all five colors, but we've focused it in white and black. The white-black draft archetype is built around the corrupted mechanic. It's the deck that often wins by poisoning you some.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">While the basics of corrupted didn't change, the Set Design team did spend a lot of time figuring out how best to use corrupted. What the delta should be (the power level difference between your opponent being corrupted and not), what effects it should generate, and how it intermingled with other themes all shifted quite a bit. This is a great example of the difference between vision design and set design. In vision design, we try to figure out the big picture. In set design, the team focuses more on execution. Yes, the concept of corrupted was key to making the set work, but how exactly it needed to be used required a lot of iteration.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>3. The use of scaling effects</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Blessbringer</strong><br />
4W<br />
Creature — Phyrexian Angel<br />
3/3<br />
Flying<br />
When CARDNAME enters the battlefield, gain 2 life for each poison counter all opponents have.</p>

<p>In addition to the corrupted threshold, there are some spells that simply get stronger based on how many poison counters a particular opponent has. These spells are all usable if the opponent has no poison counters but scale up the more they have. One particularly interesting variant are spells that cost one less for each poison counter an opponent has.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Two out of three ain't bad. There was a lot going on with poison, so the Set Design team decided to mostly stick with corrupted as a poison reward. Also, as scaling effects had to accommodate up to nine, it was hard to make effects that were balanced. My favorite execution was the cost reduction to spells because it allowed us to make spells that had a tighter power band.</p>
</div>

<p>The combination of these three things has led to an environment where poison is playing more roles than it had in <em>Scars of Mirrodin</em> block. Decks can aim to poison an opponent a little, a medium amount, or the full ten to kill them with it. This also allows for more mixing and matching of poison and non-poison cards.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">It took a lot of work from Set Design and Play Design, but I think <em>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</em> did a good job of allowing a spectrum of poison decks to exist.</p>
</div>

<p>I just wanted to point out two other things we're trying with poison. First, we have some cards that give you some amount of poison counters as a cost of using the spell. We think these can be interesting in an environment where having different amounts of poison can matter environmentally.</p>

<p>Second, in blue, we've made some poison punisher spells, where the opponent is given two options, one of which is taking some poison counters. The idea is that the opponent is never forced to take the poison and thus can never die from one of these spells.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Offering to the Collective</strong><br />

Enchantment<br />
At the beginning of each player's end step, that player may return a creature they control to their owner's hand. If they don't, they gain a poison counter.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">None of this stuff made it. Vision Design likes to overshoot a bit to give Set Design more options in what to use. Poisonous/toxic and corrupted provided all the tools needed, so a bunch of the other ideas were removed to lessen complexity.</p>
</div>

<h3>Proliferate</h3>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Laboratory Incrementor</strong><br />
2U<br />
Creature — Phyrexian Wizard<br />
2/3<br />
At the beginning of your end step, if you cast an instant or sorcery spell this turn, proliferate. <em>(Choose any number of permanents and/or players, then give each another counter of each kind already there.)</em></p>

<p><em>Scars of Mirrodin</em> block also closely associated the Phyrexians with the proliferate mechanic. Like poison, it plays into the Phyrexians-as-disease metaphor. While infect was very polarizing, proliferate was mostly beloved by the players. It returned in <em>War of the Spark </em>to much fanfare. As with poison, we felt the audience would expect proliferate to appear in a Phyrexian-focused set.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Of the three P's that we felt players most associated with Phyrexia (poison, proliferate, and Phyrexian mana), proliferate was the piece we felt the safest about. Play Design spent a lot of time on it during <em>War of the Spark</em>, so we were confident that the set would have proliferate.</p>
</div>

<p>The key to making proliferate work in the set was figuring out what kind of counters we wanted to use. <em>Scars of Mirrodin</em> used proliferate with -1/-1 counters, while <em>War of the Spark </em>used it with +1/+1 and loyalty counters. After trying different things, we settled on oil counters, which are blank counters that carry no inherent mechanical capabilities. This would allow us to create a proliferate environment that was very different from either <em>Scars of Mirrodin</em> or <em>War of the Spark</em>.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">The idea of no +1/+1 counters was a bit controversial when we handed the set over. Set Design even went so far as to put them in the set, but as they playtested, they realized the set worked better without them and took them back out.</p>
</div>

<p>Proliferate is primary in blue, secondary in green, and tertiary in red. Blue and green are the natural colors for proliferate from a philosophical and mechanical standpoint. We chose red as the third color as it wasn't a poisonous color and had more interaction with oil counters. I should note that the Council of Colors feels the ability makes sense within the world of New Phyrexia, but it wasn't something they wanted to see in larger formats, as it's not super red in philosophy. We agreed to keep proliferate in red as a tertiary thing meant primarily for Limited play.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Proliferate would stay in blue and green, but it moved from red to black during set design. I believe this was due to several factors. The two biggest being that black needed it more and color-pie concerns.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Note that I made sure in the handoff document to point out the color issues with the mechanic. It's important in a handoff to make sure that the team you're handing off to is aware of all the issues. We kept proliferate in red because it was achieving many things where the set was at the time, but I wanted Set Design to be fully informed when they figured out if it was supposed to stay.</p>

<!-- The Autonomous Furnace -->    
<h2>The Autonomous Furnace</h2>
<p><em>The Autonomous Furnace was the first sphere established by Phyrexia in their assault on what was once Mirrodin. The Mirran resistance now uses it as a refuge and staging ground, ignored by Urabrask while the praetor furthers his own plots.</em></p>
<p>This 60-card Singleton event takes us to the Autonomous Furnace, the red-dominated sphere of New Phyrexia. Nothing is wasted in this massive forge complex: when you discard a card here, you'll still be able to cast it this turn. Use your resources wisely, and you'll earn red ichor card styles from <em>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</em>.</p>
<h3>The Autonomous Furnace Event Details</h3>

<ul><li><strong>Dates</strong>: February 13–16</li>
<li><strong>Entry</strong>: 2,500 Gold or 500 gems</li>
  <li><strong>Format</strong>: Singleton with The Autonomous Furnace Emblem</li>

<p>This is a summary of the rules changes we have planned for <em>Magic</em> with the release of <em>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</em>. The official rules are still under review at the time of this writing. When they are published, they can be found on our <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/gameplay/rules-and-formats/rules" target="_blank">rules page</a>. If there should be a discrepancy between this summary and the official rules, the official rules take precedence.</p>

<h2>New and Updated rules</h2>

<h3>For Mirrodin!</h3>

<h4>702.163</h4>

<p>This new section covers For Mirrodin!, a new triggered ability on Equipment that creates a 2/2 red Rebel creature token and attaches the Equipment to that token, arming the resistance for battle against the Phyrexians!</p>

<h3>Toxic</h3>

<h4>702.164</h4>

<p>This section defines toxic, a new static ability that gives players dealt combat damage by toxic creatures poison counters in addition to the normal results of the damage. Multiple instances of "toxic N" can add up, and the number of poison counters given to the player is equal to the sum of those abilities, called the "total toxic value" of the creature.</p>

<h4>120.3g</h4>

<p>Toxic is also added to the list of possible results of damage.</p>

<h2>Other rules changes</h2>

<h4>303.4g</h4>

<p>If an Aura tries to enter the battlefield from anywhere other than the stack but has nothing legal to enchant, it just stays in its current zone. Now the rules clarify that if an Aura token would have nothing to enchant, it simply isn't created since it doesn't have a current zone to stay in.</p>

<h4>903.3e</h4>

<p>This addition to the Commander rules allows cards that reference your commander's characteristics to find your commander and see its current characteristics regardless of what zone your commander is in. Now <a class="autocard-link" data-image-url="https://media.wizards.com/2023/one/en_f2284f496a.png">Tangleweave Armor</a> can find your (hopefully big) commander even if it is hanging out in your hand or library.</p>

<h3>Battles</h3>

<h4>315</h4>

<p><a class="autocard-link" data-image-url="https://media.wizards.com/2023/one/en_ee8abf90a4.png">Atraxa, Grand Unifier</a> references the card type "battle" in its reminder text. A new section has been added to the rules for the battle card type. It has one subrule, which explains that there are currently no battles. If that should change, that section will be updated accordingly.</p>

<h2>New Types</h2>

<p>Battle</p>

<h2>New Subtypes</h2>

<p>Mite<br />
Sphere</p>

<h2>New Glossary Entries</h2>

<p>Battle<br />
For Mirrodin!<br />
Toxic</p>

<p>The<em> <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/products/phyrexia-all-will-be-one" target="_blank">Phyrexia: All Will Be One</a></em> Update Bulletin is the place to find information about changes to the <em>Magic</em> Comprehensive Rules that are coming with the set's release, as well as updates to the official text of some cards. This document is written while the rules and card text changes are still going through editing, so it's possible they'll be a little different from the final changes. When the rules are finalized, you'll be able to see them on the <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/gameplay/rules-and-formats/rules" target="_blank">rules page</a>.

<h3>Toxic and Poison Counters</h3>
<div style="width: 100%; margin-bottom: 20px;">
<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 550px;" src="https://media.wizards.com/2023/images/daily/toxic_badge_wjt5anwek8z5.png" alt="Toxic badge" /></div>
<div style="margin: 0px auto; font-family: courier; font-size: larger; width: 85%;"><em>A player dealt combat damage by a creature with toxic also gets poison counters equal to that creature's total toxic value. </em></div>
</div>
<p>Creatures with toxic will have a badge that also indicates their toxic value&mdash;how many poison counters are given to that player when dealt combat damage&mdash;to ensure that information remains top level.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://media.wizards.com/2023/images/daily/toxic_1_77jt7ppbmc56.jpg" alt="Toxic 1" /></div>
<p>It's important to remember that toxic causes an <em>additional</em> effect! Creatures with toxic deal combat damage <em>and</em> give poison counters to players, and a creature's toxic value and its power aren't necessarily connected.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://media.wizards.com/2023/images/daily/toxic_2_9p5efrjxdphk.jpg" alt="Toxic 2" /></div>
<p>Give +1/+1 to creature with toxic 1? Its toxic value will (still) be 1. There are also some specificities to toxic, such as only applying to players being dealt combat damage, but you can always mouseover (or tap on mobile) the card reminder text!</p>
<h3>Corrupted</h3>
<p>Corrupted is a new ability word that highlights abilities that care whether an opponent has three or more poison counters. On <em>MTG Arena</em>, cards with corrupted have a badge that both represents the ability word <em>and</em> keeps track of the necessary poison counters an opponent must have for corrupted abilities to be utilized.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://media.wizards.com/2023/images/daily/corrupt_1_k9x8cxmcz648.jpg" alt="Corrupted 1" /></div>
<p>As your opponent gains poison counters, the badge on cards in hand and on the battlefield will update to reflect their current corrupted state, cumulating in three appropriately toxic-green poison counters.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 550px;" src="https://media.wizards.com/2023/images/daily/proliferate_badge_y8ajhm63wxjk.png" alt="Proliferate badge" /></div>
<div style="margin: 0px auto; font-family: courier; font-size: larger; width: 85%;"><em>Choose any number of permanents and/or players, then give each another counter of each kind they already have.</em></div>
</div>
<p>When you proliferate on <em>MTG Arena</em>, the game will automatically select targets based on the type of counters you have and will prompt you to confirm the selection before submitting. For example, it will automatically choose to proliferate your opponents poison counters and oil counters on permanents you control but <em>not</em> your poison counters.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://media.wizards.com/2023/images/daily/proliferate_1_vszm5bwch6v7.jpg" alt="Proliferate 1" /></div>
<p>If a player or permanent has more than one kind of counter, please note in the reminder text that proliferate gives another of <em>each </em>kind they already have&mdash;you can't have it get just one kind of counter it already has and not the others.</p>
<h2>Additional Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>The display of compleated planeswalkers on the stack has changed to account for the player paying life. For example, casting Jace, the Perfect Mind for 2U and 2 life results in him showing 3 loyalty on the stack, instead of 5.</li>
<li>Be careful when dealing damage to Phyrexian Obliterator and Phyrexian Vindicator! <em>MTG Arena</em> will prompt for manual combat damage assignment if there are multiple legal ways to assign damage&mdash;don't assume the default assignment is what you want!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Other Improvements and Features</h2>
<p>In addition to the card set, we want to highlight a few noteworthy changes, improvements, and bug fixes players should expect on February 7:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Music to Your Ears</strong> &ndash; You can once again listen to other audio while playing on iOS mobile devices!</li>
<li><strong>Waste Not, Want Not</strong> &ndash; There are several bug fixes related to how the deck builder handles Wastes, most notably players will be able to save colorless Historic Brawl decks using Wastes and to change the number of Wastes in your deck while using the Suggest Lands feature.</li>
<li><strong>Color Coordination</strong> &ndash; The mana pips shown on deck boxes now handle colorless decks properly and should do a better job of matching the colors your deck actually uses when considering things like hybrid cards, multicolor lands, etc.</li>
<li><strong>You Must Be New Here</strong> &ndash; The event blade will now highlight when new events are added.</li>
</ul>
<p>Full patch notes will be available once maintenance is complete.</p>

I only got halfway through, so this week is the second half.</p>

<h1>Mana Component</h1>

<p>After playing with the land mechanics, we came to the realization that we wanted more ways to spend the extra mana you ended up with. At the same time, we were looking for an old mechanic to bring back. (Recent design philosophy has us believing that we need to be better at reusing existing mechanics—as such, we are aiming at one returning mechanic per block.) Kicker became the obvious choice.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This idea of consciously trying to bring back a mechanic in most sets started around this time.</p>
</div>

<p>Once we decided to add kicker, we knew we needed to have a new twist. Multikicker was the design team's solution. The idea we liked was that it played nicely into our mana theme because it allowed you to use as much mana as you had. Also, it seemed like an obvious extension. The design team does feel very strongly that the keyword be worded as a kicker extension (meaning "kicker" needs to be in the name) and not an unrelated mechanic.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Multikicker ended up being pushed back to <em>Worldwake</em>, as it felt like we should do kicker first before evolving it. The name multikicker stuck.</p>
</div>

<p>Here's how the two abilities played out in each rarity:</p>

<p><strong>Common (20, 10 Kicker, 10 Multikicker)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Cycle of kicker creatures with "comes into play" effects </strong>– These creatures have a comes-into-play ability only if you pay the kicker. Currently the kicker and effects are small, but that was more a result of them fitting slots open late in design. I agree with Henry that these should change to have larger kicker costs (and larger bodies) to differentiate them better from the multikicker creatures.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This cycle stayed, but an extra red creature and green creature were added, as those were the colors that got extra mana the easiest.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Cycle of cantrip kickers </strong>– This is a cycle of instants (note that these could be sorcery effects, but we happened to choose five instants) that each allow you to draw a card if you pay the kicker cost. These kicker costs are lined up on purpose to fulfill NWO (in short, we're trying, especially at common, to have alike things work more similarly to each other). Henry and I have talked about these changing to raise the kicker cost. My suggestion is to make the effects efficient at one mana with a three-cost kicker to get the cantrip.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This cycle went away.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Cycle of multikicker creatures </strong>– These creatures each have a multikicker of 2 to get an additional +1/+1 counter. The duplication of kicker costs is NWO compliant.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Multikicker was obviously cut as it was moved off to <em>Worldwake</em>.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Cycle of multikicker spells </strong>– These are all instants and sorceries that are able to expand their effect by paying for extra kicker costs. Note that for multikicker, we want the effect or creature to get bigger, not to get an extra effect. This brings up another important issue, the need to separate kicker from multikicker. We tried hard to have kicker do things that multikicker could not. Also note that this cycle requires you to talk with Gottlieb. The multikicker creatures will be easy to template, but the spells might cause some problems.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">The cycle stayed but became all instants. The majority just had kicker effects that increased the scope of what the effect was, but blue and black added a second ability (ones we thought were synergistic enough to feel like the spell was upgraded).</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Uncommon (6)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Alternate-cost kicker creatures </strong>– This is a group, but not a cycle, of creatures that the caster can make bigger by paying a non-mana kicker cost, in each case playing into that color's land interaction theme. These cards are Veteran Hang Glider, Sneaky Swimmer, and Earth Monster.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">All the alternate cost kicker cards got removed from the set.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Miscellaneous kicker creatures </strong>– Uncommon has a few other random kicker creatures. Note that there are currently no multikicker cards at uncommon. We had a cycle of creatures that had larger swings for higher multikicker costs, but it got pushed off to "Long" to free up some space at uncommon.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Uncommon kicker creatures were mostly miscellaneous. White and blue got one, while black and red got two. Green got no uncommons.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Rare/Mythic Rare (4)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Miscellaneous multikicker creatures/spells</strong> – There are various creatures with large multikicker effects. There are no kicker cards currently at rare.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Rare ended up with seven miscellaneous kicker cards, but none of them were multikicker.</p>
</div>

<p>From the feedback we've gotten throughout the design playtests, no single item in the set has gotten the positive feedback of multikicker, the multikicker creatures in particular. If we want to differentiate kicker from multikicker more (and I can see reasons to do so), I recommend trying to adapt what kicker is doing.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Another reason multikicker got pushed off was because we had stuffed a little too much into the set and felt pushing off something that had tested so well would give Ken Nagle a leg up on his first design lead.</p>
</div>

<h1>Flavor Component</h1>

<p>Once we established the idea of High Adventure World, we set out to create some mechanics that reflected the world and gave the set the feel we wanted. Here's what we came up with:</p>

<h2>Traps</h2>

<p>To convey the sense that the world is deadly, we came up with the idea of Traps. The intent, by the way, is also to make their subtype "Trap." Traps went through numerous design versions, but the versions we ended up with are flash global enchantments with tap abilities.</p>

<p>Let me address several issues. First, why enchantments. The design team felt it was important for Traps to be flavorful. To do this, they must feel like a thing. Instants, while able to surprise, don't convey the sense of a Trap. In addition, making it a permanent allows us the ability to create flavorful cards that interact with it, including cards that can destroy them. The reason for enchantments over artifacts is that the previous year had a strong artifact subtheme, and "Lights" (2009's large set) has an artifact theme. As such, we don't want too much focus on artifacts. Maps are currently artifacts, and the team didn't want the two most flavor-driven mechanics both to be artifacts. Finally, having the Traps be enchantments allows access to in-color abilities, which allows for much more flavorful Traps. If the development team feels that Traps need to shift over to artifacts (and I'm beginning to feel like it's the right choice), we ask for them to think of shifting maps (possibly with a name change—something like quests) to enchantments.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">The design version of Traps is not as far away from the finished product as they might sound. They were enchantments with flash that got cost reductions if the opponent did a certain action. The big difference is that rather than a singular effect, they created negative global enchantments that stuck around and harmed your opponent and/or their stuff.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Also, the development did listen to us about maps. And "Lights" was the codename of <em>Scars of Mirrodin</em>.</p>
</div>

<p>Here are the qualities of Traps that we feel are important to maintain:</p>

<p><strong>Traps should "go off," </strong>that is, something the opponent does should set it off.</p>

<p><strong>Traps need to punish the opponent, </strong>ideally connected to the action he or she did to set the Trap off. We tried having Traps that create positive effects for you and they felt weird.</p>

<p><strong>Traps should be able to have an element of surprise. </strong>A great deal of the fun of Traps is catching your opponent, which requires you knowing about it and them not.</p>

<p><strong>The opponent should have the ability to play around a Trap.</strong> If your opponent "reads" you, they should be able to react in a way that will keep the Trap from going off. This means Traps should not trigger off something the opponent has to do. For example, triggering off the opponent playing a land wouldn't work.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">In handoff documents, I like to explain how something works so that if the team I'm handing off to wants to design new cards, they understand the parameters of how we made them.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">The Traps ended up getting changed from enchantments to instants. Development was less concerned with the flavor disconnect feeling the instant represented the act of the Trap being sprung.</p>
</div>

<p>Currently, the mix in the set is as follows:</p>

<p><strong>Common (0)</strong></p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;"><em>Zendikar </em>ended up having two common Traps, both in blue.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Uncommon (10)</strong></p>

<p>There are two cycles of Traps at uncommon. One cycle triggers off your opponent's creatures, dealing 4 combat damage to you.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Uncommon dropped from ten to eight Traps and didn't link the trigger condition.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Rare (5)</strong></p>

<p>Rare has a loose cycle of Traps. These were designed to be narrower and thus more for Constructed build-arounds and sideboards.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Rare and mythic rare ended up having four Traps.</p>
</div>

<h2>Maps</h2>

<p>The flavor of maps is that they are impetuses to adventure. They give you a reward and tell you what you need to find to achieve it. The maps, as is, are more designed to give a sense of how maps will work than be exact implementations. Development needs to work with Creative once they know what the key places are going to be. This needs to be done early so that things like creature types can be hammered out. Maps are currently artifacts, intended to be called a specific "Map" in the card title, but if Traps swap to artifacts, we recommend moving maps, with a new name (maybe quests), to enchantments.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">The swap to becoming enchantments called quests happened, but Traps didn't become artifacts.</p>
</div>

<p>Here are the qualities that we feel are important to maintain:</p>

<ul>
	<li>There are multiple things you have to acquire.</li>
	<li>The map refers to lands and/or things that feel like places.</li>
	<li>There is a significant payoff (aka a good treasure) to encourage players to want to use the map.</li>
	<li>The things you need have some relevance to the reward you get.</li>
</ul>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">The original maps are similar to the quest mechanic we tried out in <em>Throne of Eldraine </em>and <em>Zendikar Rising</em>. You had three items and/or tasks you had to acquire and/or accomplish. If you did that, you could sacrifice the card for a larger spell effect.</p>
</div>

<p>Currently, the mix in the set is as follows:</p>

<p><strong>Common (3)</strong></p>

<p>Common has three simple maps made such that anyone could make use of them.</p>

<p><strong>Uncommon (5)</strong></p>

<p>This is a cycle. Each one looks for three things, the appropriate basic land and two other things (currently, one on each is a creature type).</p>

<p><strong>Rare (3)</strong></p>

<p>These are narrow maps meant to be built around.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">The quests ended up being an uncommon cycle only.</p>
</div>

<h2>Teamwork ("Chaps")</h2>

<p>The last flavor-based mechanic was created because we felt the set needed a creature-based mechanic, one simple enough to be a common linear mechanic. Teamwork was the mechanic created to fill this need. Whenever a creature with teamwork comes into play, it puts a +1/+1 counter on every other creature you control with teamwork.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This was the precursor to the Ally mechanic. Teamwork made every Ally into a better Muscle Sliver, and that proved problematic. Matt Place and I ended up making a mini team to find a replacement. We chose to make cards that had an effect whenever itself or another Ally entered the battlefield. Interestingly, we had three different types, ones that created scalable effects, which we called Wizards; ones that gave every Ally an ability, which we called Clerics; and ones that got bigger (with +1/+1 counters), which we called Fighters. You can see even back then the flavor of a D&amp;D adventure party was part of our thinking of the trope space.</p>
</div>

<p>Here's the breakdown:</p>

<p><strong>Common (5)</strong></p>

<p>All the commons are currently vanilla creatures with teamwork (okay, that technically makes them French vanilla). Originally, they were like the current uncommons, but to try and further simplify common, we took off the extra ability. For the record, they played well but had too much text.</p>

<p><strong>Uncommons (5)</strong></p>

<p>This cycle contains creatures that gain a keyword when one other creature with teamwork is in play. The old uncommons that got two keyword abilities when two other teamwork creatures were in play have been moved off to "Long."</p>

<p><strong>Rare (0)</strong></p>

<p>There are currently no creatures with teamwork at rare. This isn't on purpose. If there is a good rare design, there's no reason it couldn't exist. There is a white enchantment that grants all your creatures teamwork.</p>

<p>Finally, the design team acknowledges that there are a lot of +1/+1 counters in the set. Both multikicker and teamwork make major use of them. As a result of this, design pulled a number of cards using +1/+1 counters from the set to keep them focused on the two areas that needed them. The high use of counters also means the set can handle a few cards that interact with +1/+1 counters. There are a few such cards in rare right now.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">So, none of this happened.</p>
</div>

<h1>And the Rest</h1>

<p><strong>Rare/Mythic Rare Miscellaneous</strong></p>

<p>Here are a few other cycles and cards sitting in the set:</p>

<p><strong>Kickass creatures </strong>– This is a rare cycle of French vanilla rare creatures. Each one has only one or two keywords. Be aware that <em>Magic 2010</em> might steal (or has stolen) a few of these.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This cycle didn't make it. I do think a few rare creatures in the set started as this cycle and had additional things added to them.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Legendary adventurers </strong>– Creative provided us with a list of five legendary adventurers. They are the heroes trying to get the goodies from the world. They are in rare and mythic rare.</p>

<p><strong>Legendary monsters </strong>– Creative provided us with a list of five legendary monsters. They are there to stop any adventurers trying to steal the land's goodies. They are in rare and mythic rare.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">There ended up being four mythic rare legendary creatures. Back then, we made a lot less legendary creatures and tried to put most of them at mythic rare.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Planeswalkers </strong>– There are three planeswalkers in this set: a female elf, a male goblin, and a male human in green, red, and white, respectively.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">The female elf was Nissa. She'd been a character in the <em>Duels of the Planeswalkers </em>game we made to lead the elf deck. She became popular enough, so we decided to make a card for her. The goblin turned into Chandra who was needed for story reasons. The white human turned into a mono-black Sorin.</p>
</div>

<h1>New World Order</h1>

<p>There are a number of things at common put in to match NWO:</p>

<p><strong>Vanilla creatures </strong>– Every color but blue (who has the least amount of creatures) has a vanilla creature. This is part of our attempt to pull down complexity at common.</p>

<p><strong>French vanilla creatures </strong>– There was an effort to put more French vanilla creatures into common.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Both of these cycles stayed.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Virtual (French) vanilla creatures </strong>– One of the big shifts with NWO is the idea of virtual creatures. A virtual creature is one that exist as a vanilla creature after the first turn. Virtual French Vanilla creatures are ones who are French vanilla creatures after the turn they come into play. "Comes into play" creatures, kicker creatures, and multikicker creatures all fall into this category. This terminology is important because a big part of NWO has been finding ways to shift complexity away from the board. Virtual creatures allow the complexity to happen when the card is played and then settle into a simple board. It is my belief that NWO is going to push us to use more virtual creatures at common.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This was me introducing the term "virtual vanilla," which is still used in R&amp;D to this day.</p>
</div>

<h1>In Summary</h1>

<p>We hope this overview has given you a better sense of all the inner workings of "Live" design.</p>

<p>This was one of the best design teams I have had the pleasure of working on, and I am very proud of what we were able to accomplish. Feel free to inquire with any further questions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">It was an excellent design team, and I'm very proud of what we designed. I'm also happy with how development was able to take what we made and make it even better.</p>

In the past, I've shown off the vision design handoff document for <em>Throne of Eldraine</em>, <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/throne-eldraine-vision-design-handoff-part-1-2019-11-11" target="_blank">Part 1</a> and <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/throne-eldraine-vision-design-handoff-part-2-2019-11-18" target="_blank">Part 2</a>, <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/ikoria-vision-design-handoff-2020-05-04" target="_blank"><em>Ikoria</em></a>, <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/zendikar-rising-vision-design-handoff-document-2020-09-28" target="_blank"><em>Zendikar Rising</em></a>, and original <em>Zendikar</em>, <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/original-zendikar-design-handoff-document-part-1-2020-10-12" target="_blank">Part 1</a> and <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/original-zendikar-design-handoff-document-part-2-2020-10-19" target="_blank">Part 2</a>. Today, I'm going to show you the handoff document from <em>Strixhaven</em>.</p>

<p>Before I start, I should give my normal intro for vision design handoff documents. Most of what you'll read below is the text of the actual document I handed off a year and a half ago. Any comments I've made will be in boxes below the vision design text. The text outside of the boxes is the actual document. Things always change during set design, so I will explain how things in the document turned into the things that ended up in the set. I hope you enjoy this peek behind the curtain.</p>

<h1>"Fencing" Vision Design Handoff Document</h1>

<p><strong>Vision Design team</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Mark Rosewater (lead)</li>
	<li>Doug Beyer</li>
	<li>George Fan</li>
	<li>Ari Nieh</li>
	<li>Yoni Skolnik</li>
	<li>Andrew Veen</li>
</ul>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;"><em>Strixhaven</em>'s codename was "Fencing." Most premier sets (there are some exceptions, such as the upcoming D&amp;D set) are currently following a series of alphabetic sports names. <em>Throne of Eldraine</em> started as "Archery," and since then we've had "Baseball" (<em>Theros Beyond Death</em>), "Cricket" (<em>Ikoria</em>), "Diving" (<em>Zendikar Rising</em>), and "Equestrian" (<em>Kaldheim</em>). Yet to come (of what's started design) are "Golf," "Hockey," "Ice Skating," "Judo," "Kayaking," "Lacrosse," "Marathon," and "Netball." (There aren't a lot of good choices for N. It's an English variant of basketball.)</p>
</div>

<p>Here are the four main parameters for "Fencing." These four parameters define the set:</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">I start off every vision design document talking big picture. Even more important than the individual mechanics is the overarching structure that defines what the set is about and how we expect it to be perceived by the audience. <em>Strixhaven</em>, from its very beginning, has always been a combination of complimentary elements, many of which I know the audience has been wanting for years. Some themes, like a traditional enemy multicolor focus, have been things I'd been trying to get into a set for a long time, while others, like instants and sorceries mattering, were themes I'd been waiting to find a proper home for.</p>
</div>

<ul>
	<li><strong>It's a top-down wizard school.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>We're trying to find more worlds with genre-rich trope clusters. While a magic school has plenty of its own tropes, it also lets us tap into school tropes, which are universal and plentiful (especially in pop culture). A lot of the resonance of this set is going to come from hitting as many of these school and/or magic school tropes as we can on cards.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>It's an enemy color gold set.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>While we do enemy color gold cards from time to time, the last expansion to have it specifically as a theme was <em>Apocalypse</em>—eighteen years ago! (The last set to even have enemy colors as its main theme was <em>Eventide</em>—eleven years ago.) "Fencing" should make sure to have several desired enemy color cycles (a few are listed later in this document) and legendary creatures (as it's something Commander players ask for all the time).</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>It's a two-color faction set.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>One of the biggest experiments of "Fencing" is trying to demonstrate that we can have two-color factions sets that have their own identity apart from Ravnica. As such, one of the main objectives of "Fencing" was to create five unique factions, called schools, that were flavorful and thematic yet still let the colors be true to themselves. The factions having new identities is a feature, not a bug of the design. Also, the fact that the factions are built around their internal conflict rather than their area of overlap is a unique distinction of the schools.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>It has a strong instant and sorcery theme.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>While we've used instants and sorceries as a small subtheme in the past, "Fencing" is making it a major theme of the set, thematically playing into the wizarding school motif. This focus has had a huge impact on what mechanics we've chosen and how we've executed certain elements of the set. Also, as the following set is returning to Innistrad, having a greater focus on spells will make a good contrast to "Golf," which will be more focused on creatures.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">You'll noticed that the finished set hits all four of these parameters strongly. While much will change with what mechanics got used (more on this below), the basic essence of what the vision was for the set never changed. A few quick notes:</p>

<p style="margin-left:.3in;margin-right:.1in;">• You'll see in this document that I called the factions "schools." We ended up changing this to "colleges" to better reinforce that this was a magical university.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.3in;margin-right:.1in;">• Often when I talk about the future in these documents, I black it out, but everything I say here is already public and/or easy to figure out. We're always thinking about what sets precede and follow each set. Sets do not live in a vacuum, so that's something we keep an eye on.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.3in;margin-right:.1in;">• When I call <em>Innistrad</em> "the following set," I was skipping over the summer's D&amp;D set. At the time I was writing this document, we were still defining what role the set was going to play.</p>
</div>

<h1>The Schools</h1>

<p>We began the vision design by defining the five factions. Each school was chosen a subject matter of study (including a number of classes within that study), a few student archetypes, a token type, and a style of gameplay. All the names are placeholders.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">All of what follows was created by the Vision Design team working closely with the Creative team to create factions that would fill their needed roles both flavorfully and mechanically. I'll point out when things deviated.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>[Shadix]</strong></p>

<p><strong>Colors</strong>: White-black</p>

<p><strong>Field of Study</strong>: Rhetoric (persuasive speech and writing)</p>

<p><strong>Classes</strong>: Literature, Writing, Speech, Psychology, Ethics, Foreign Languages, Communications, Marketing/Advertising, Journalism</p>

<p><strong>Style of Magic</strong>: Spoken word and runic</p>

<p><strong>Philosophical Conflict</strong>: Are we to inspire the world of what it could be (white) or inform the world of what it really is (black)?</p>

<p><strong>Student Archetype</strong>: ROTC, "mean girls," jocks, privileged kids, overachievers</p>

<p><strong>Token Type</strong>: 2/1 flier (Gargoyle)</p>

<p><strong>Style of Gameplay</strong>: Aggro</p>

<p>Shadix is the school of words. It teaches various classes that center on the use of words (literature, writing, public speaking, foreign languages, communications, etc.). It teaches spoken and runic magic. Spoken word is the fastest form of spellcasting and thus is the magic of ritualized combat. Because of this, Shadix is the school that teaches magical fighting. All the schools teach you how to use magic to do different things, but Shadix teaches you how to fight with it. As such, it's the school with the magic that's cheapest and easiest to cast in a pinch. This leads Shadix to having a very aggressive magical style, using its spells to try and beat the opponent as quickly as possible.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This description didn't end up deviating too much from the finished product. We had pegged white-black as the aggro faction during vision design (as we specifically didn't want it being red-white) and spent a lot of time with the Creative team figuring out how to make that all come together. The concept that really clinched it was the idea that Silverquill was the school about words and that vocal magic, which was the fastest to cast, was best suited to fighting, which let white-black be the most combat-oriented faction.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">The one change, and it's a minor one, was that we originally had the Silverquill creature token/mascot set as a Gargoyle. We liked the idea of one of the schools having a Gargoyle as their mascot as it matched the school setting so well, and white-black ended up with the flying token. It didn't really match up with the school, so the Gargoyle was changed to an Inkling, a brand-new creature type that thematically fit better. The Gargoyle was going to be a white-black artifact creature token.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">You'll also notice that this college was going to originally be called Shadix. The white-black Elder Dragon's first name, Shadrix, I assume was derived from this early name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">One last thing, and this is just me being picky looking back at my own work. I believe psychology would actually be in Lorehold, as that's the college more about community and motivations of larger groups. Silverquill would have classes, like persuasive writing, that dip into aspects of psychology.</p>

<p><strong>[Mithren]</strong></p>

<p><strong>Colors</strong>: Blue-red</p>

<p><strong>Field of Study</strong>: Art</p>

<p><strong>Classes</strong>: Painting, Drawing, Music, Dance, Theater, Fashion Design, Sculpture, Interior Design</p>

<p><strong>Style of Magic</strong>: Gestures and the arts</p>

<p><strong>Philosophical Conflict</strong>: Is art supposed to make people think (blue) or feel (red)?</p>

<p><strong>Student Archetype</strong>: Visionaries, intellectuals, creative types</p>

<p><strong>Token Type</strong>: 3/3 (Elemental)</p>

<p><strong>Style of Gameplay</strong>: Big spells</p>

<p>Mithren is the school of art. It teaches various classes that center on expression (painting, music, dance, theater, etc.). It teaches gesture and artistic magic. Because it's the school most about putting on a show, Mithren teaches large, showy magic. This leads Mithren to focus on building up to larger, splashier spells. (Because Izzet is focused on spells, we took extra effort to make Mithren play in a different space, wanting to cast one larger spell rather than a lot of little ones.)</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Prismari also didn't change all that much from the vision design pitch of the college. Behind the scenes, this was the college that caused us the most problem deviating from the Ravnica guild, as the main theme of this set, instants and sorceries, was an Izzet-focused theme. I do think our "go big" strategy worked. The one change I do notice is that the Elemental creature token grew from a 3/3 to a 4/4. It was our biggest token during vision design, but the Set Design team realized it could be bigger.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>[Ravona]</strong></p>

<p><strong>Colors</strong>: Black-green</p>

<p><strong>Field of Study</strong>: Life Sciences</p>

<p><strong>Classes</strong>: Biology, Chemistry, Anatomy, Geology, Medicine, Agriculture, Botany, Food Science, Genetics, Zoology</p>

<p><strong>Style of Magic</strong>: Component and biologic</p>

<p><strong>Philosophical Conflict</strong>: Is life defined by what creates it (green) or the forces that shape and kill it (black)?</p>

<p><strong>Student Archetype</strong>: Goth kids, cool troublemakers, bad influences</p>

<p><strong>Token Type</strong>: 1/1 with "gain 1 life" death trigger (Grub)</p>

<p><strong>Style of Gameplay</strong>: Midrange</p>

<p>Ravona is the school of life. It teaches all the life sciences (biology, chemistry, medicine, agriculture, etc.). It teaches component and organic magic (where you mix natural components together to create spells). Organic magic is very focused on the cycle of life, making use of both life and death as resources. (To keep Ravona separate from Golgari, we are specifically focusing on life as a resource rather than the graveyard.)</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Witherbloom might be the college that changed the least. The "life matters" theme made it to print, and the creature token merely changed its type from Grub to Pest.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>[Primald]</strong></p>

<p><strong>Colors</strong>: Red-white</p>

<p><strong>Field of Study</strong>: History</p>

<p><strong>Classes</strong>: History, Law, Political Science, Philosophy, Finance, Education, Business, Theology, Sociology, Archeology</p>

<p><strong>Style of Magic</strong>: Summoning and spirits</p>

<p><strong>Philosophical Conflict</strong>: Are civilizations inherently led by chaos (red) or structure (white)?</p>

<p><strong>Student Archetype</strong>: Bookish nerds, history hipsters</p>

<p><strong>Token Type</strong>: 2/2 (Spirit)</p>

<p><strong>Style of Gameplay</strong>: Control</p>

<p>Primald is the school of history. It teaches all the classes centered on society (history, law, political science, philosophy, theology, etc.). It teaches summoning magic, which calls on ancient spirits to perform its spells. Of all the schools, Primald is the most focused on the past and thus looks to graveyard for many of its resources.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">While Lorehold kept the essence of what the Vision Design team had created, it definitely went through a number of changes in how to execute that vision. The graveyard stayed a big component of the college, but the Set Design team did a great job of finding additional ways to make it work. Also, I believe they sped up the speed of this college a little from vision design, where it was the slowest.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This is the only school to creatively change its style of magic. Rather than being based on spirits (we leaned a littler heavier on Spirit tribal during vision design than the finished set), it became scroll-based magic. The creature token/mascot stayed a Spirit but grew from a 2/2 to a 3/2.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>[Zymmot]</strong></p>

<p><strong>Colors</strong>: Green-blue</p>

<p><strong>Field of Study</strong>: Math</p>

<p><strong>Classes</strong>: Math, Physics, Engineering, Accounting, Economics, Astronomy, Aviation, Programming (probably spell creation in a fantasy setting)</p>

<p><strong>Style of Magic</strong>: Formulaic and geometric (the drawing of shapes, for example)</p>

<p><strong>Philosophical Conflict</strong>: Is math a natural system that we've discovered (green) or a product created by us (blue)?</p>

<p><strong>Student Archetype</strong>: Weirdos, outsiders, obsessed with numbers</p>

<p><strong>Token Type</strong>: 1/1 (Fractal)—often cast in multiples</p>

<p><strong>Style of Gameplay</strong>: Go wide</p>

<p>Zymmot is the school of math. It teaches all the classes focused on the hard sciences, the ones that are more based in numbers (math, physics, engineering, economics, etc.). It teaches formula- and geometry-based magic. This is magic that makes use of natural systems, which it often controls using shapes as a means of expression. Geometric magic is mostly based on growth and takes advantage of replication to produce larger systems.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Quandrix is the college that changed the most. We had created it as a go-wide faction during vision design. It changed during set design from that to a ramping faction. You can see this change in the creature token/mascot. Fractals (the name didn't change) were 1/1 creatures during vision design, and you most often created two or more when you created them. The Set Design team followed through on the Vision Design team's desire to keep it feeling "math-y."</p>
</div>

<h1>Set Mechanics</h1>

<p>To separate the set from Ravnica, instead of assigning a keyword to each faction, the set has mechanics that stretch across all five factions but are used differently by each school. The set's mechanics are:</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Before we get into the mechanics, let me dive a little deeper in something I say very quickly in the first sentence here. <em>Strixhaven</em> was about proving we could create a two-color faction set that had a very different identity from Ravnica. We've learned how much players love multicolor factions, and two-color combinations are by far the easiest to design around. While the audience clearly likes the occasional visit to Ravnica, it just isn't something we want to be our only go-to when doing two-color factions. A big goal of <em>Strixhaven </em>was trying to demonstrate other ways to do that.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">There were two big parts of this. The first part was making the factions have their own identity. That involved doing things like focusing on conflict rather than overlapping and looking for different mechanical executions. The second part was rethinking the overall structure. Yes, the low-hanging fruit for faction design was to give every faction its own keyword, but that isn't the only way to do it.<em> Strixhaven</em> was a faction set with a more cohesive overarching theme (spells matter), allowing us to have a number of mechanics available to all the factions. The key to making this work is making sure that each faction could use the mechanics in a way that played up their theme.</p>
</div>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Spellcraft </strong>(Whenever you cast or copy an instant or sorcery spell<nbsp>. . .</nbsp>)</li>
</ul>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Reckless Tremormancer</strong><br />
2R<br />
Creature — Human Shaman<br />
2/2<br />
Spellcraft – Whenever you cast or copy an instant or sorcery spell, CARDNAME deals 1 damage to each creature.</p>

<p>Spellcraft is an ability word that goes on permanents and triggers whenever an instant or sorcery is cast or copied. Here's how each school is using it.</p>

<p><strong>[Shadix] </strong>– Spellcraft effects in this school are about small incremental creature boosts and go onto aggressively designed creatures. Instants and sorceries help you keep up your aggressive threats. This school likes when you cast a lot of cheap instants and sorceries on the same turn.</p>

<p><strong>[Mithren] </strong>– Spellcraft effects in this school don't stack, so instead of encouraging lots of small instants and sorceries on a single turn, it rewards being more consistent across turns. It also has some effects that reward you for casting larger spells.</p>

<p><strong>[Ravona] </strong>– Spellcraft effects in this school often gain you life (to play into the school's "life matters" theme) and allow you to permanently grow your permanents or resources.</p>

<p><strong>[Primald] </strong>– Spellcraft effects in this school tend to be more defensive and controlling. At higher rarities, they also play into the school's connection with the graveyard, at times returning things in the graveyard to the player's hand.</p>

<p><strong>[Zymmot] </strong>– Spellcraft effects in this school tend to support the school's theme of building up creatures and going wide. It also will have effects that are often stronger the more creatures you have.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">We explored a bit with how to make spells matter in exploratory design, but it was apparent quickly that we basically wanted instant- and/or sorceryfall. Instants and sorceries aren't permanents that sit on the battlefield, so there are a lot less ways to care about them mechanically. Also, this was an ability we could put onto our permanents to make them care about instants and sorceries. The "or copy" was part of the design from the very beginning. We knew getting enough instants and sorceries in your deck in Limited was going to be an ongoing problem, so we wanted the mechanic to count everything we could. Some earlier designs did more copying by the way.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">To help support this new faction structure, it was important to show how each college could use this mechanic in a different way. I do think the finished product did a good job of making different colors care about spells in various ways.</p>
</div>

<h1>Stay Tuned for Part 2</h1>

<p>We've hit our word count for today. Next week, you'll see the second half of the vision design document where we talk about other elements of the vision design, including several mechanics that didn't make it into the final set. As always, I'm eager to hear your feedback on this document, on this column, or on <em>Strixhaven</em> in general. You can <a href="mailto:making.magic@hotmail.com">email</a> me or contact me through any of my social media accounts (<a href="https://twitter.com/maro254" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://markrosewater.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Tumblr</a>, <a href="http://instagram.com/mtgmaro" target="_blank">Instagram</a>, and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@markrosewater" target="_blank">TikTok</a>).</p>

<p>Join me next week for part two.</p>

<p>Until then, I hope you enjoy this peek behind the curtain.</p>

It dawned on me that I have a lot of these documents sitting on my computer and that it might be fun to look at some from the past. As we're in the middle of a return to Zendikar, I thought it might be fun to go to the original <em>Zendikar </em>and see what that document looked like.</p>

<p>A few caveats before we begin:</p>

<ol>
	<li>How these documents are put together has changed a bunch over time, so this one is a little different than the recent ones I've posted. (For example, no sample cards.) I believe this document was handed over in early 2008.</li>
	<li>This was back when R&amp;D had the design/development model, so I'd spent more time on the set than I do on vision design (closer to a year in contrast to the four months I get now), which means the set was much further along.</li>
	<li>Most of the text below is the actual document as it was turned in. The boxed text is my notes, which explain things to help you get some larger context.</li>
</ol>

<h1>"Live" Design Document</h1>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Original <em>Zendikar </em>block was codenamed "Live," "Long," and "Prosper." It was a set of codenames suggested by the public. This document came before we started calling them handoff documents.</p>
</div>

<p>"Live" design can essentially be broken down into three parts: a land component, a mana component, and a flavor component. I will explain what I mean by each part.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">By the time, we started making the public-facing message, the "land component" and "mana component" themes just got concentrated down to "land component" with the idea that mana is part of land's identity.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Land component</strong> – The set started its design by tapping into what we felt was one the most open veins of design—land mechanics. The team spent a great deal of time examining different mechanics and ended up with what we thought was the cream of the crop.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Because Bill Rose, the vice president of R&amp;D then and now, was a bit skeptical of my idea for a land-focused world, I was given three months to create a proof of concept. The design team (me, Doug Beyer, Graeme Hopkins, Ken Nagle, and Matt Place) spent the vast majority of that time working on land mechanics. We created over 40 different mechanics and ended up with landfall. Obviously, Bill liked what we had done enough to let us finish making it.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Mana component </strong>– One of the side effects of making players care about land is that you start to encourage them to play with more land. To take advantage of that and to help make sure that playing lots of land was good for the environment, we decided to add a mix of cards that let you spend all the extra mana you have available.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">I think I pulled out "mana component" as a separate category at a time to better explain why kicker was in the set, but no one seemed to bristle at kicker just being good in a "land set."</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Flavor component </strong>– Once we had defined the land as the mechanical heart of the block, we went to the Creative team to explain what kind of world would beget such a thing. Creative liked the idea of a world where the land has extra qualities that made it more powerful and different than other lands. As such, it would attract Planeswalkers and others who sought the special mana. This led to a world that starts defending itself (maybe naturally, possibly through an outside force). This led to the idea we've called High Adventure World, filled with big prizes, grand adventurers, and great dangers. Numerous mechanics were created to flesh out the High Adventure World feel.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">We later shortened "High Adventure World" to just "Adventure World." You'll note that I like to break down sets in component pieces to help people visualize what role each part plays. I also want to point out the Eldrazi didn't exist yet as a concept on the world. That would come about as the Creative team tried to solve what the third set in the block was going to be about.</p>
</div>

<p>I am going to walk through each section in order, explaining what is in the set and why we've included it. In addition, I'll add any lessons we've learned along the way. Finally, "Live" is the first set to fully incorporate New World Order into the design. This had a huge influence, so I'm going to point out the impact whenever I can. I will be abbreviating New World Order as NWO.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">For those unaware of R&amp;D history, Matt Place and I came up with the idea of New World Order (check out <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/new-world-order-2011-12-02" target="_blank">this article</a> if you have no idea what I'm talking about) after watching employees struggle at the <em>Morningtide </em>employee Prerelease. Some of the ideas got added retroactively to <em>Shards of Alara </em>block, but <em>Zendikar </em>was the first set to be built from the ground up incorporating New World Order.</p>
</div>

<h1>Land Component</h1>

<p>The land component breaks into several parts:</p>

<h2>Landfall</h2>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Yes, "landfall" was what we called the mechanic in design.</p>
</div>

<p>All our playtesting showed that two land mechanics stood heads above the rest. The first was what we refer to as landfall. Landfall is an unnamed trigger mechanic. It is "whenever a land comes into play under your control." We tried keywording it, but it seemed unnecessary and made the cards more confusing rather than less, so we took off the keyword.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">At that point, we didn't use the word on the cards. Obviously, that decision got overridden in development.</p>
</div>

<p>The reason landfall has worked so well is that it makes lands a resource, but in a way that encourages players to do something they are already doing. We messed around with mechanics that rewarded you for not playing a land (called landshort), and it resulted in players often having to do things they would normally prefer not to do. Landfall also had the huge advantage that a single card worked fine with it in any deck, as all decks play land.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Landshort rewarded you for not playing lands as a resource, and it was not fun. Playtesters kept mana screwing themselves. Landshort came first, then we came up with landfall by making negative landshort.</p>
</div>

<p>The reason the mechanic is so weighted toward common is that it is the thing that most defines the feel of the environment and is the one new thing we chose under New World Order to put into common. (One of the ways to maintain NWO is to have less new things to track at common; the current philosophy is to have less things but to make use of them more. Landfall is the only "new" triggered thing—aka something you have to keep track of happening—at common.)</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">New World Order was still a pretty new thing, so I was using this document to remind the developers of how the design was making use of it.</p>
</div>

<p>Here's what exists in the set:</p>

<p><strong>Common (10)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Creatures with landfall that enhance others in their cycle </strong>– These cards are designed such that the thing you gain makes sense when lands can be played. Green is the only color to have an ability that can be reactive, it was allowed this because green is the color that can easiest get lands into play at other times. Note that part of meeting NWO is that these cards only affect themselves and thus create much less board complication.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Development ended up removing the white and red cards from this cycle. Green's ability is the only one that doesn't enhance itself, but we felt life gain was NWO compliant. This isn't the ability I'm referencing above. I don't remember what it was.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Cycle of "battlewand" creatures that get +1/+1 until end of turn with landfall</strong> – We chose to make one cycle with the exact same effect to help simplify landfall at common. Also, these cards play nicely together and give low-level players an easy deck to build.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This cycle got turned from +1/+1 to +2/+2. I remember when Henry Stern, the initial lead developer for the set, made the change, my response was, "Really?! Okay, if you think it's not going to cause any problems." I have no idea why we called them "battlewand."</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Uncommon (11)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Cycle of visionary creatures (currently all 2/2 for 2C) using landfall to produce an effect </strong>– These cards were originally common but moved to uncommon, both because they break NWO protocol and common is not supposed to be careful about both repeatable effects and cards that affect other permanents. The cycle is currently very tight—2/2 for 2C—but this part is not crucial to their design.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This whole cycle went away. I believe development felt that we had more landfall cards than we needed.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Three "coffee card" enchantments</strong> – At landfall, these cards can add a counter and then can choose whether to sacrifice to get an effect based on the number of counters. This used to be a full cycle, but we didn't like the white and black ones, so we just dropped it down to three. It could easily be turned into a cycle again if the development team wanted it to. Note that the cards can only be sacrificed at landfall. There is no cost to sac the cards, but there could be (although no cost is much cleaner).</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This cycle (the Expeditions) was put back to a full cycle and then moved to common in development. The reason we nicknamed them "coffee cards" was because every landfall got you a "punch" on your card that you could turn in for something.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Three other random landfall effects</strong> – We decided to fill out uncommon so that every color had at least two uncommon landfall cards. Green ended up getting three, which we felt was okay because green seemed the most attuned to land. These cards have landfall with bigger effects that we thought were exciting but that we didn't want at common.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">These were the ones that stayed at uncommon. Green ended up getting only two uncommons, and blue and red each got one.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Rare/Mythic Rare (3)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Few miscellaneous landfall cards </strong>– These cards have no connection other than having landfall.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">The printed set ended up having three landfall rares, but I highly doubt it was the exact three we handed over.</p>
</div>

<h2>Spell Lands</h2>

<p>The other big land innovation is lands that come with spells attached. We are saving lands that double as permanents for "Long" so there are no lands that turn into creatures or have activations that feel like spells that are repeatable turn after turn. (The rare mega-lands grant comes-into-play effects on other cards, so we felt they were more like spells.) Also note that we decided to link up the land negatives such that all the lands come into play tapped (yes, exceptions do exist at rare) and all the cycles below have basic land types. While this might need to be changed for power reasons (especially on the rare cycle), we do feel that the basic land-ness on the nonbasic lands is one of the signatures of the set.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">The basic land thing didn't stick as it made the lands a little too good (it let you basically fetch spells with basic land fetching).</p>
</div>

<p>Playtesting showed that the "comes into play" lands wanted to have low costs to use for two reasons. One, it increased your ability to play the effect. We liked this because not getting your effect the majority of the time felt bad. Second, small costs meant small effects, and the cards played better with small effects.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This theme ended up getting dialed back a bit in development.</p>
</div>

<p>Here's what the set has:</p>

<p><strong>Common (10)</strong></p>

<p><strong>"Comes into play" lands</strong> – these are lands that have a comes-into-play effect. Some of them require an optional mana payment to get that effect. These lands all come into play tapped, have a basic land type, and tap for the appropriate color. At common there are two cycles:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Zero-cost effects (common) – These lands cost nothing to get the effect. The effect is still optional and is on-color for the basic land type.</li>
</ul>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This is the only common land cycle to stay.</p>
</div>

<ul>
	<li>One-cost effects (common) – These lands have a small effect costing C.</li>
</ul>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">The development team thought we had too many spell lands and liked the free ones better, so this cycle was pulled.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Uncommon (10)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Bigger "comes into play" lands</strong> – There is another cycle at uncommon:</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This cycle of spell lands was also pulled in development.</p>
</div>

<ul>
	<li>Two-cost (uncommon) – These lands have a slightly larger effect costing 1C.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Dual lands</strong> – This is a cycle of five lands. Each comes into play tapped and gains you 1 life. Each land has two allied basic land types and thus taps for two different colors of mana. I've included this cycle here because the life gain acts as a small spell effect. This dual land cycle was designed specifically for this set and fits very well in multiple ways ("comes into play" effect, basic land types, comes into play tapped, etc.)</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This cycle, the Refuges, stayed in the set, but lost their basic land types.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Rare (5)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Mega-lands </strong>– This is a cycle of lands that come into play tapped, have a basic land type, and tap for the appropriate color. In addition, each land creates an effect when they or any other basic land of their kind comes into play if there are seven other lands in play. (The current cards need some templating help by the way.) These effects are rather big and splashy but are unable to go off until late game. I am not sure whether they want the basic land types or need to be legendary. As both are development power concerns, I left the cards in their most open (and probably most powerful) version.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This cycle changed a lot in development. Only <a class="autocard-link" data-image-url="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Valakut%2C+the+Molten+Pinnacle" href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valakut%2C+the+Molten+Pinnacle">Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle</a> really comes close to hitting what this original cycle did.</p>
</div>

<p>These land spells are to me very much the heart of the design. These exist in the number that they do (ten at common, ten at uncommon, and five at rare) because their volume very much shapes the environment. Part of the dynamic of the block is to get players to reevaluate how they use their lands and how they think about lands in general. A big part of that (in "Live") is that the lands take up some of the role that spells normally do. Among other things, this allows smaller spells that normally don't see play into decks and the restriction of when you can play lands means that you have to reevaluate when you do things. (As an example, you often want to play the landfall card before you play your land for the turn.)</p>

<p>I feel the combination of landfall and the spell lands are the foundation of the "new feel" of the set. Without existing in substantial volume, they cannot create enough volume to shift the block's feel. That is why there are ten landfall cards and ten spell lands at common, and eleven landfall cards and ten spell lands at uncommon. I believe strongly that their volume is an important part of this block's feel.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Development did not agree with me on the volume issue. Landfall was lowered some, especially at uncommon, and the spell lands were pulled way back.</p>
</div>

<h2>Interacts with Land</h2>

<p>In addition to landfall and spell lands, there are a few other elements of the set that interact with lands.</p>

<p><strong>Count basics</strong> – There is a cycle of cards spread between common and uncommon that count basic land types. (Red for some reason ended up with two, but it only needs one.) These exist partly because we wanted monocolor builds to be possible, following on the heels of <em>Shards of Alara</em>'s three-color block and partly because we wanted more spells that feel like they care about land.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This ended up not being a cycle, but four cards spread across common and uncommon (a common green card and uncommon white, black, and green cards).</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Explorers </strong>– This is a creature cycle at uncommon. When the creatures are put into the graveyard from play, they allow you to get a basic land of the appropriate type (and thus interact with all the basic land types on nonbasic lands) and put it either into play tapped or into your hand. The choice started as a tool to figure out which way we wanted the mechanic to go, but playing with it made us decide to keep it as is. The reason was that it was intriguing how the decision went both ways and often made for a cool decision as to what to get. It also gives the cycle a very unique feel that the design team really liked.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This cycle didn't make it, partly because we didn't end up using the basic land types on the nonbasic lands. I did like the choice between the hand and the battlefield tapped. I'm a bit sad that never got used.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Interact with land themes</strong> – Because the colors all share the same tools (often we will color separate mechanics, but this set's mechanics didn't lend themselves to it), the design team wanted to add some themes to each color that would allow them to interact with land differently. To help hide this (and take the word "land" off some cards) a lot of the themes were broadened to allow them to do their thing to cards other than just lands. Also note that we worked hard to find cards that would have this function yet feel very natural in any set.</p>

<p>Here are the color themes. Each card has two commons and one uncommon in theme:</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Some of these themes made it into the set, but not as structured as this spells it out, and not in these numbers.</p>
</div>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;"><strong>White</strong> = Bounce lands – Deployed Soldier, Saving Throw, and Veteran Hang Glider<br />
<strong>Blue</strong> = Discard lands – Human Looter, Study, and Sneaky Swimmer<br />
<strong>Black</strong> = Use or return lands from graveyard – Dig Up, Zombie Horde, and Graveplot Horror<br />
<strong>Red</strong> = Turn lands into things – Rock Eating Orc, Rocky Time, and Magma Infusion<br />
<strong>Green</strong> = Sacrifice lands – Harrow, Feral Chicken, and Earth Monster</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">White had two cards that bounced your own permanents. Blue had two cards that filtered cards allowing you to discard lands. Black had one card that returned lands from the graveyard. Red had no land-transformation spells. Green had two cards that sacrificed lands.</p>
</div>

<p>These cards were also designed to create fun interactions. ("I block with this enchanted land so that I can get it into the graveyard to allow my other creature to live for another turn.") Note that there are a few cards that subtly do things above in colors other than what is listed (blue has a bounce spell, or black can cause itself to discard.)</p>

<p>These cards are important because they both create identity for the colors, allowing decks to be built around them, and they allow exciting moments of discovery where players get to feel good about themselves for finding the interactions.</p>

As a reminder, most of the text below is the actual text from the original document. All my notes about it are in boxes.</p>

<hr />
<ul>
	<li><strong>Flashback </strong><em>(You may cast this card from your graveyard for its flashback cost. Then exile it.)</em></li>
</ul>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Embellish</strong><br />
UR<br />
Sorcery<br />
When you cast your next instant or sorcery this turn, copy that spell. You may choose new targets for the copy.<br />
Flashback 2UR <em>(You may cast this card from your graveyard for its flashback cost. Then exile it.)</em></p>

<p>Flashback is a returning mechanic. It plays into the sets instant and sorcery theme, allowing players to maximize the number of instants and sorceries cast per game. The monocolor flashback spells try to branch between the two schools that would use them while the multicolor spells are more focused on communicating what the guild is up to. The faster guilds ([Shadix] and [Ravona]) are more likely to have cheaper spells to allow them to recast them quicker.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">A spells-matter set wants you to cast as many instants and sorceries as possible. Flashback, which only goes on instants and sorceries, lets you cast spells twice. It was a great fit for the set, and flashback's an awesome mechanic. I have no regrets putting it into the vision design. I'm sorry it couldn't stay. I unfortunately can't tell you the story of why it had to leave the set today as it involves information you all don't know yet, but I promise to reveal it to you when I can.</p>
</div>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Conjure [creature type] – [cost]</strong><em> (If you cast this spell for [cost], when it enters the battlefield create an [appropriately sized, colored, and creature-typed] creature token.)</em></li>
</ul>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Spirit Backup</strong><br />
W<br />
Instant<br />
Target creature gets +2/+2 until end of turn.<br />
Conjure Spirit – 2W <em>(If you cast this spell for 2W, also create a 2/2 red and white Spirit creature token.)</em></p>

<p>Conjure is an ability that goes onto instants and sorceries. It allows you to spend extra mana to create a creature token (and, in a few cases, multiple creature tokens) of the appropriate type. This mechanic is in the set to help players cast more instants and sorceries while giving them access to creatures later in the game. These cards could be de-keyworded, but then there would only be one option where the spells automatically come with a creature token. Note that the tokens line up with the five token types of the schools.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Creature tokens are important in a spells-matter set because they allow you to have more instants and sorceries in your deck while still having enough creatures. The Set Design team ended up doing it more on a card-by-card basis rather than connecting it to a keyword. In vision design, I like to give the Set Design team more structured ways of doing things, as it's easier to pull out structure than add it. I'll note that conjure uses a replacement cost rather than an added cost (like kicker) as we've found it's easier for players to process.</p>
</div>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Familiar</strong> – [Effect]<nbsp>. . .</nbsp>if you control a creature token.</li>

2/2<br />
Menace<br />
Familiar – CARDNAME enters the battlefield with a +1/+1 counter if you control a creature token.</p>

<p>Familiar is an ability word for cards that get a bonus effect if you control a creature token. The mechanic doesn't care about what creature token you have, only that you have one. As it's an ability word, it's possible to drop it from the cards if you'd like less vocabulary in the set.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">I like to think of the Vision Design team as tool makers who give the Set Design team a box of tools that they can use to build the set. We leaned a little more into token making during vision design, so this ability word was just another way to flesh out a group of cards where token making played a larger role. The thing I liked most about this ability word was that it got the concept of familiars into the set, which is a big trope in the magic school genre.</p>
</div>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Multifaced cards (MFCs)</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The multifaced cards in "Fencing" are all themed to represent the schools and the inherent conflict they're built on. There are fifteen MFC cards in the set, making three cycles:</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">In the very beginning, MDFCs were going to play a much larger role because we originally planned for this to be the only set that had them. Once we spread them out over the <em>Magic</em> "year," they got knocked down to a much lower presence.</p>
</div>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Dean of Death</strong><br />
2B<br />

Legendary Creature — Human Advisor<br />
3/2<br />
At the beginning of your end step, if you gained life this turn, create a 1/1 black and green Grub creature token with "When this dies, gain 1 life."</p>

<p><strong>The Deans (mythic rare) </strong>– Each school is run by a pair of deans who each represent one side of the school's conflict. These cards are legendary creatures on each side, each mechanically representing one side of the enemy color conflict. We believe this cycle will be exciting for the Commander crowd (and possibly tournament Constructed).</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">The idea of having each college led by two deans representing the two parts of the conflict of each college started very early, and it was obvious they had to be MDFCs. The cards all got remade during set design, but the cycle stayed. Our version of the designs had them mechanically a little more mirrored than the printed versions.</p>

<p><strong>Permanents/spells (rare) </strong>– This cycle includes a permanent on one side of one color and an instant or sorcery on the other side of the second color. The cards play up the conflict within the school and are designed to work in the same deck.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">The cycle was mostly redesigned but stuck around. Our version of the cycle was a little more focused on playing up the conflict in the colleges.</p>

<p><strong>Lands (rare) </strong>– This cycle consists of double-sided lands that tap for colorless mana. One side has a colored activation with a tap ability that can be repeated each turn. The other side has a colored activation with a sacrifice cost, allowing a bigger effect that you do once. The two sides are made to be synergistic with one another.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This cycle didn't make it. It was moved up to mythic rare and replaced by two planeswalker cards and three legendary creatures with spells on the back.</p>

T: Add one mana of any color.</p>

<p>Scrolls are artifact tokens that hold an instant or sorcery spell within them (much like the flavor of a scroll). You can sacrifice the artifact to cast the spell for its mana cost. The spell is then treated as if you had actually cast it, doing things like triggering spellcraft and allowing it to be copied or countered. Uncommon has a cycle of creatures that come with a scroll that is prefilled with an existing spell (all of which are fairly famous <em>Magic</em> spells). Rare has a two-color cycle and an artifact that allow you to create scrolls in various ways. The intent of scrolls is that it's something splashy and new at a low as-fan and at higher rarities.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Of all the things that got removed during set design, this is the mechanic I was saddest to see leave. It's super flavorful and playing in space that we really haven't done much of outside of imprint. I like to believe that this concept led to the idea of the Mystical Archive, which is a great addition to the set. I'm going to keep this idea in my back pocket and see if I can find a future set where it fits well.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This cycle didn't make it, but the idea of lands representing each college's campus did find a home. I was tickled by Dorm as a land subtype.</p>

<p>Common has a number of colorless instants and sorceries (currently five) that represent freshman courses at the college. (Students join a school at the start of their sophomore year.) We did these as a tool to help players fill out their decks with instants and sorceries. These five cards fill the void usually filled in sets by common artifacts.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This cycle got turned into Lessons, and individual cards got changed, but it made it to print. The flavor of colorless first-year spells was too good to pass up.</p>
</div>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Prospectuses</strong></li>
</ul>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>History Prospectus</strong><br />
3<br />
T: Add R or W.<br />
1RW, Sacrifice CARDNAME, T: Create a 2/2 red and white Spirit creature token.</p>

<p>The Prospectuses are a cycle of common artifacts that serve as this set's "mana rocks" that tap for one of two colors and can then be sacrificed for a cost involving both colors to make that school's creature token. We also envision this cycle being a place to creatively show off the school's symbol (we assume the set will have watermarks for the schools) and/or pennant.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This cycle came about because we wanted a place to show the pennant for each college. The set ended up not using mana rocks, so it never found a home. I do think it was an elegant design.</p>
</div>

Familiar – CARDNAME enters the battlefield with a +1/+1 counter if you control a creature token.</p>

<p>This is a common cycle of monocolor creatures that each have familiar and enter with a +1/+1 counter if you have a creature token.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This was the common cycle using the familiar ability word. The goal was to make something flavorful but simple. The cycle went away when the ability word was dropped.</p>
</div>

<ul>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Double Boost</strong><br />

Familiar – When you cast this spell, copy it if you control a token creature. You may choose a new target for the copy.<br />
Target creature gets +2/+2 until end of turn.</p>

<p>This is a cycle of monocolor common instants and sorceries with familiar that all copy themselves if you control a creature token. These are designed as both spellcraft and token enablers.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">I said last week that we handed over a bit more copying than ended up in the printed set. Here's one example. Like the above cycle, this got removed when the ability word was dropped.</p>
</div>

Spellcraft – Whenever you cast or copy an instant or sorcery spell, target creature gets +1/+0 and menace until end of turn.</p>

<p>This is a cycle of uncommon enemy color creatures with spellcraft. They're designed to play into each school's play pattern and serve as one of the cards that helps communicate the school's Draft strategy. They are flavored as top students from the schools. It's possible that this cycle's supposed to be legendary.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This cycle became the apprentices. It obviously did not become legendary.</p>
</div>

<strong>• </strong>Create a 3/3 green Elephant creature token.<br />
<strong>• </strong>Create a token that's a copy of a creature you control.<br />
<strong>• </strong>Exile target creature. That creature's controller creates a 3/3 green Elephant creature token.<br />
<strong>• </strong>Draw a card for each creature you control.</p>

<p>The Commands are a cycle of rare enemy sorceries that give you four modes and let you choose two. We've done monocolor Commands and ally color Commands, but never enemy color ones. These are obviously tied into the schools.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">One of the exercises we did in exploratory design was figure out cycles we'd done in other color combinations, but never enemy colors. The two big ones on the list were legendary Dragons and Commands, so we put both in the set. The Set Design team redesigned the individual cards, but both cycles stayed.</p>

<p>This is a rare cycle of enemy color hybrid creatures tied to the schools. They exist as a tool for the Play Design team to adjust devotion in Standard. They are designed as splashy school-themed creatures that can mechanically work in either color.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This is a good example of how we look to the past as well as the future. <em>Theros Beyond Death </em>had a devotion component, and we were asked by Play Design to include some heavy hybrid permanents to give them a knob to adjust devotion in Standard. These cards didn't end up being needed, so they got cut. The Set Design team worked in a little hybrid elsewhere in the set.</p>
</div>

Whenever damage is dealt to a creature you control, CARDNAME deals that much damage to any target.</p>

<p><em>Magic </em>has had monocolor, ally color, wedge color, and arc color legendary Dragons, but never enemy color. We knew these were so important that we worked them into the story—the five schools were each founded by a different dragon. These are currently a cycle at rare but should possibly be at mythic rare. These are designed to be both splashy and solid tournament shots.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">I knew early that we wanted enemy color legendary Dragons, early enough that Doug Beyer was able to weave them into the origin of the colleges. And yes, this cycle did get pushed up to mythic rare.</p>
</div>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Top-down designs</strong></li>
</ul>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Student Protest</strong><br />

Choose one —<br />
<strong>• </strong>Counter target spell unless its controller pays X, where X is the number of creatures you control.<br />
<strong>• </strong>Look at the top X cards of your library where X is the number of creatures you control. Put one of them into your hand and the rest on the bottom of your library in any order.</p>

<p>There are many designs, especially at higher rarities, that are top-down designs capturing school (and sometimes specifically magic school) tropes. The Vision Design team and Creative team have created lists of tropes for the Set Design team to work with. It's a very rich, resonant, and deep cluster of tropes.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">I've long been a believer in the power of tropes to enhance set design. We spent a bunch of time in vision design creating top-down cards, not because we necessarily felt those actual cards would get printed (although some of them did) but because we wanted to demonstrate the importance of using top-down designs to create a particular feel for the set. I'm very happy that this gauntlet was clearly picked up by everyone downstream of us. There was, by the way, a separate file that was a giant list of school and magic school tropes that we'd collected during vision design. That's what I'm referencing above.</p>
</div>

<h1>Extra Content</h1>

<p>What follows are two items that were pulled from the design.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">One of the things we sometimes do in these handoff documents is show things we created in vision design that were removed. They're extra tools for the Set Design team to use if needed. Also, they might inspire the Set Design team to create something similar but different.</p>
</div>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Study</strong></li>
</ul>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Guardian Ancestor</strong><br />
1W<br />
Creature — Spirit<br />
2/2<br />
2: Study. Activate this ability only when you could cast a sorcery.<br />
(A) Spirits you control have vigilance.<br />
(B) T: Another target creature you control gains protection from the color of your choice until end of turn.</p>

<p>Study is a mechanic where you can spend a resource (tapping at common, mana at uncommon) to add an ability to the card. Each card with study has two options of abilities to add. The second time you activate it, you can add the ability you didn't choose the first time. The card would most likely have a frame that would serve as a play aid to make it clear which abilities you have. This mechanic got removed, as there was too much board complexity and study, while thematic, was less connected to the overall framework of the set.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Study is a great example of a mechanic that's very fun and flavorful on the surface but ends up creating more gameplay complexity than desired. Also, it was a bit more permanent-centric than the set needed. I do think there's something very cool here, but it needs another iteration or two.</p>
</div>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Implements</strong></li>
</ul>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier">B/G Implement<br />
2<br />
Artifact<br />
Activate abilities of CARDNAME only when you could cast a sorcery.<br />
2B, T: Target creature gains lifelink until end of turn.<br />
2G, T: Put a +1/+1 counter on target creature.<br />
4BG, T: Do both.</p>

<p>Implements were a cycle of uncommon artifacts that had two different tap abilities (one in each color of the school) and a third ability which was the combination of the two abilities. They were designed as artifacts useable in three schools but maximized in one. They were removed from the set to lessen board complexity.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This was another mechanic that had noble goals but unfortunate side effects on gameplay. This mechanic never got the official look through by the rules manager, so I'm not sure "do both" would have actually worked.</p>
</div>

<h1>In Conclusion</h1>

<p>Those are all the main elements of "Fencing." I believe the set will be a big hit if it hits the four parameters listed at the beginning of this document. The focal point of the four parameters is the identity of the five schools. If each one has a clear-cut identity (which the Vision Design team and Creative team worked hard to establish) that's tied to what the school represents as a school, including highlighting the conflict of the colors while wrapping itself in all the available school tropes and playing up the spell theme, I believe we have a recipe for success.</p>

<p>The Set Design team has some wiggle room in the play execution (red-white might work better as a mid-range, graveyard-focused deck rather than a slow, controlling one, for example). The key is making any changes stay true to the school identities. I'm very excited to see what you are all able to build with the tools we've provided. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">The reason I'm so happy with <em>Strixhaven </em>is that I feel the Vision Design team (with a lot of help from the Creative team) laid out a very compelling vision for the set, and the Set Design team (along with many other sections of R&amp;D and the rest of the company) worked to take that concept and make it the best version of itself that it could be. I am beyond happy with how the set turned out.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">As I mention at the end of all my design handoff articles, this document is just one piece in a very elaborate system to make <em>Magic</em> sets. While I write everything down to help everyone get on the same page, there's a lot of communication between the Vision Design and Set Design teams (as well as many other teams) all through the process beyond this document.</p>
</div>

<hr />
<p>And that is the design handoff document for <em>Strixhaven</em>. These have proven very popular, so I plan to keep publishing them. As always, I'm eager to hear your feedback on this document, on this column, or on <em>Strixhaven</em> in general. You can <a href="mailto:making.magic@hotmail.com">email</a> me or contact me through any of my social media accounts (<a href="https://twitter.com/maro254" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://markrosewater.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Tumblr</a>, <a href="http://instagram.com/mtgmaro" target="_blank">Instagram</a>, and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@markrosewater" target="_blank">TikTok</a>).</p>

<p>Join me next week as I answer all your questions about <em>Strixhaven</em>.</p>

<p>Until then, I hope you learned something about<em> Strixhaven </em>design that you didn't know.</p>

These documents are designed to walk the Set Design team through the vision of the set as well as introduce the various mechanics and themes the Vision Design team created.</p>

<p>Here are the documents I've published so far:</p>

</ul>

<p>As we're about to return to Innistrad for two sets (<em>Innistrad: Midnight Hunt</em> and <em>Innistrad: Crimson Vow</em>), I thought it would be fun to go back to the very beginning and show you all the design handoff document I created for original <em>Innistrad</em>.</p>

<p>As with my <em>Future Sight</em> article, there are a few caveats I have to offer before we begin:</p>

<ol>
	<li>How these documents are put together has changed a bunch over time, so this one is a little different from the vision design ones I've posted. (For example, no sample cards.) I believe this document was handed over in the fall of 2009.</li>
	<li>This was back when R&amp;D had the design/development model, so I'd spent more time on the set than I do on vision design (closer to a year in contrast to the four months I get now), which means the set was much further along.</li>
	<li>Regular text shown below is the actual document as it was turned in. Everything in the boxes consists of my notes, which explain things to help you get some larger context.</li>
</ol>

<h1>"Shake" Design Document</h1>

<p>The "Shake" design team set out with one simple goal: we wanted to take the genre of horror and bring it to <em>Magic</em>. The team didn't need to invent much, as most of the elements already existed in the game. Our goal was to take these elements, with a few new ones, and combine them to create a rich top-down world that embodied fantasy horror. The team I put together included myself, Richard Garfield, Jenna Helland, Graeme Hopkins, and Tom Lapille.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;"><em>Innistrad</em> block used the codenames "Shake," "Rattle," and "Roll."</p>

<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">By now, most of you recognize Richard as the creator of <em>Magic</em>. Jenna Helland worked on the Creative team for fifteen years overseeing various stories and worldbuilding. This was the first set where she served as the creative lead. Graeme Hopkins came in third in the first <em>Great Designer Search</em> and works as a programmer on the <em>Magic the Gathering: Arena</em> team. Tom LaPille spent many years working on the R&amp;D development team (doing a combination of what set design and play design do now).</p>
</div>

<p>After much discussion, we've decided that we need to embrace four elements to bring the set to life: a tribal "monster" component, a graveyard component, a "death matters" component, and a transformation component. These four components will be the backbone of the design.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">One of the things I like to do in my documents is break up the design into various grok-able bite sizes. This just makes it easier for everyone to digest and remember.</p>
</div>

<h2>TRIBAL "MONSTERS"</h2>

<p>When we began talking about what players would expect to see in a horror set, the first answer was monsters. While we discussed many different monsters, the four that seemed to win at the end of the day were vampires, werewolves, zombies, and ghosts (aka spirits). This discussion also brought out the importance of humans in horror stories. The monsters had to be threatening someone. In addition, the heroes are traditional humans that stand up to the monsters. The set needed some slayers and monster hunters.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">One of the cute ways we used to describe what monsters we chose was that we "picked the breakfast cereal monsters." We felt that common sugar-rich cereals, some dating back as early 1971, did a good job of depicting the low-hanging fruit of popular monsters in the public consciousness. Obviously, we had to save mummies for an Egyptian-themed set we'd do someday (however, they were basically zombies).</p>
</div>

<p>With the five tribes in mind, we set out to carve space for them all. Here's where we ended up: (Note that I am listing the creature types in what I believe is their order of importance in the big picture of the design, both toward feel and for selling the set.)</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">It's key when making a handoff document to make sure the design team you're handing off to has some sense of your priorities. Things will always change, so you want to make sure they understand what's most important. The ordering of the creature types had a lot to do with what was unique to this set, the more novel things that would set this expansion apart from other expansions.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Werewolves</strong></p>

<p>Werewolves are green and red. They are all double-sided cards with a smaller Human side and a large Werewolf side. All double-sided red and green cards are Werewolves. All Werewolves have the same two triggers, one Human to Werewolf and one Werewolf to Human.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">The crux of this stayed as it was turned over, but a few things changed. First, as I'd hinted at here, the trigger did end up moving to the beginning of the next turn so that there weren't shenanigans where you could respond to the trigger by casting spells.</p>
</div>

<p>The Human-to-Werewolf trigger is an at-the-beginning-of-the-end-step trigger that happens if no spell was played by any player that turn. The trigger needs to be crafted such that players can't sneak out spells after "not having played spells for the turn." We might consider having the trigger be at the beginning of the next turn.</p>

<p>The Werewolf-to-Human trigger is an at-the-beginning-of-the-end-step trigger that happens if two or more spells were played by any combination of players that turn. The two triggers were selected to allow both players to have influence over whether the creatures transform. The triggers were made vague to convey a sense of passing time. Playtesting has shown that players seem to fill in the "the moon comes out" feel that the mechanic does not specify.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Second—and this is the biggest change—the Werewolf-to-Human trigger now only cares about whether one player plays two spells, whereas the version here only cared if any combination of players cast two spells, which created weird play incentives and wasn't as fun.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Third, we would later add the sun and moon symbols, which helped visually communicate night and day.</p>
</div>

<p>A subtle, but I believe very important, part of the design is the addition of the Werewolf creature type. (Two of the three Werewolves in existence were printed as Lycanthrope and one as Minion Wolf. All three are now Human Wolf with one being Human Wolf Minion.) I listed the Werewolves first in importance because, of all the monsters we are doing, Werewolves have never been done effectively in <em>Magic</em> and will be, in my opinion, the greatest "new" thing in the set. Also, I believe the double-sided cards are going be the key selling point, and every Werewolf has one.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Making Werewolf a creature type was actually a pretty big fight in R&amp;D. One camp, led by me, wanted to introduce Werewolf. The other camp, led by Brady Dommermuth (the creative director at the time), wanted the cards to be Human Wolf. Brady's choice better adapted to how the system worked at the time and connected naturally to the Wolf cards, but I successfully convinced enough people that Werewolf was a weighty enough word to be worth introducing into the game. It did require us making all the Werewolf tribal cards care about "Werewolves and Wolves."</p>
</div>

<p>If we are going to sell Werewolves as being a big feature, I want to make sure we're making use of the word, as words are a very potent part of conveying a feature of the set. There are a few old cards to change, all of which have Werewolf in their name and two of which aren't even what they have written on their card.</p>

<p>The Werewolf deck has a lot of suspense built into it because there is an unknown when the army of Humans will turn into the much scarier army of Werewolves. Because the Werewolf deck involves not playing spells (either to turn them or keep them from turning back), we wanted to make sure that red and green had some extra things to do with the mana.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">I should also mention that there was a little pushback to doing Werewolves in red, but I felt it was important to have each supported creature type be in two colors (that's something that continues to this day), and red made the most sense after black. (All the monsters felt at home in black.) The allied color combinations came out of where we ended up with Vampires, Werewolves, and Zombies.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Humans</strong></p>

<p>Humans are centered in white but appear in all five colors, secondarily in green. If there is a conflict in the story, it is of the humans against the monsters. Note that the monsters aren't working together, so it's not a war like<em> Scars of Mirrodin</em> block but rather a hostile environment where the humans are fighting for their lives from all sides.</p>

<p>The defining quality of humans is that they work well together. This is displayed by having a lot of individual Human cards that either help your whole team or Humans in particular. Another quality that defines humans is that they are better at using weapons than the monsters. Rather than improving cards that are equipped (something we've done a few times in recent years), we have made a few Equipment cards that are better suited for Humans.</p>

<p>Another theme woven through Humans appears only in white. To get a sense of the humans against the monsters, white has numerous cards that affect nonwhite cards or are specifically designed to deal with a certain type of monster.</p>

<p>Humans are second on this list because although Humans have been rampant in <em>Magic</em> for its entire history, we've never made a Human-specific tribal card until "Shake." This "Humans matter" theme will also matter quite a bit later in the block, as the number of Humans should go up significantly in "Roll."</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Most of our mechanical take on Humans made it to print. The "non-white" stuff turned either to "non-Human" or listed out "Vampire, Werewolf, or Zombie."</p>

<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Here's the quick story behind this being the first set that tribally cared about Humans. When the race/class model was first proposed, one of the things the majority of R&amp;D asked for when it was signed off on was that we commit to not making any Human tribal cards. When I was building this set, the five tribes became a big part of the design, and I knew it would be helpful if we could make Human tribal cards, so I went to Vice President of R&amp;D Bill Rose.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">I said to him, "Remember when we decided to do race/class and we promised to never make Human tribal cards?"</p>

<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Bill said, "Yeah."</p>

<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">"Well, I finally have a set that really wants Human tribal cards. How much of a problem is it if I make some?"</p>

<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Bill replied, "You and I are the only ones left in R&amp;D from when we made that decision. I don't care. If you want to make them, make them."</p>

<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">So, I did.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Zombies</strong></p>

<p>Zombies are in black and blue. The black Zombies are dead raised through necromancy or dark magic. They are the type of thing you'd see in <em>Dawn of the Dead</em> or any zombie apocalypse setting. The blue Zombies are flesh golems made by wizards using dead body parts (think Frankenstein).</p>

<p>The black Zombies make use of cards that either get back Zombie cards from the graveyard (always randomly to lessen the predictability) or create tokens to build a slow-growing army of undead. The Zombie deck wants to feel like zombies in that it is slow and plodding, winning by slowly overrunning the opponent with Zombies.</p>

<p>The blue Zombies all require at least one dead body (exiling creature cards from graveyards). We allowed the blue Zombies to exile from any graveyard because it played better and the flavor seemed to be "any dead body will work."</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Most of this made it to print, but there were two changes. One, while the "returning cards randomly from the graveyard" theme stayed in the set, it got cut back and put mostly in green. I think there's only one printed black Zombie that does it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Two, we changed the cards that required exiling creature cards to only use your own graveyard. It ended up creating weird incentives that didn't lead to fun gameplay. I was very proud of how we took a thing <em>Magic </em>had done many times and gave it a play pattern we'd never done before.</p>
</div>

<p>While Zombies are nothing new to <em>Magic</em> even as a tribe, "Shake" sets out to have a Zombie deck that recreates how zombies are portrayed in classic horror stories. The overall feel of the deck is what we feel is new.</p>

<p><strong>Vampires</strong></p>

<p>Vampires are black and red. Pulling them into red makes the Vampires want to be more impulsive, so we opted to make the Vampire tribe aggro in nature. The other monsters seemed to go for the throat less often, so the Vampire deck filled this void. This feel was created by having Vampires with attack triggers and stats that made them aggressive.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">The funny thing about Vampires is that most everything I wrote here stayed true, but it was a lot of work for Erik Lauer and his development team to make happen. Because black and red have the best creature kill spells, they tend to lean more toward control than aggro in Limited formats. Erik added the "combat damage adding +1/+1 counters" theme to the red Vampires and did a lot of tweaking of spells and stats to make Vampires the aggro tribe.</p>
</div>

<p>The new thing about the Vampires is their move into red. Because of this, we put the best Vampire enabler in red uncommon to create a new black-red Vampire deck.</p>

<p><strong>Ghosts (Spirits)</strong></p>

<p>Ghosts exist in all colors but show up in the greatest volume in white and blue. Ghosts are the most defensive of the five tribes. They also have the most flying. Ghosts tend to win by tying up the ground and plinking the opponent with fliers.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Looking back, if I dropped the ball anywhere in the set it was with Spirits. While every other tribe had a strong mechanical connection, Spirits ended up being mostly "things white and blue normally do." It's not that they didn't make sense with Spirits, but I wish I'd had a more cohesive plan. I'm happy that Spirits in the upcoming Innistrad sets have a better sense of mechanical identity.</p>
</div>

<h2>GRAVEYARD</h2>

<p>After tribal, the next place the horror archetype took us was the graveyard. The graveyard has a long history with horror and felt like an interesting aspect of the game to interact with. Knowing this, I told my team that I wanted to find a graveyard mechanic. We tried various graveyard mechanics (including delve from <em>Future Sight</em>) and ended up deciding to put flashback in the set.</p>

<p>Bill has set a dictum that each block returns an old mechanic, so we are always on the lookout for things to return. Flashback has always scored well in surveys, and it ended up being a perfect fit.</p>

<p>Flashback exists in all five colors. Because flashback token makers play well with Zombies, black (instead of green) got most of the flashback token-making spells.</p>

<p>The other big theme of the graveyard was random regrowing effects. Often when cards were getting cards back from the graveyard, we made the effect random to cut down on repetition of play.</p>

<p>There are some other themes that play into the graveyard. Blue has a subtheme of milling, allowing it to get cards from a player's library into his or her graveyard. Often in this set, this results in self-milling. Green has a subtheme that cares about creature cards in the graveyard. Its effects and permanents get stronger as you get more creature cards in your graveyard. Red has a subtheme of spending cards in the graveyard as a resource. The theme was kept small as the team wanted to keep the cards from completely emptying the graveyards. Black has a subtheme of getting cards back from the graveyard, usually to hand or play.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Most of this is true. Erik did add off-color flashback costs in development. As I said above, the randomly-regrowing-cards-from-the-graveyard theme did stick but got lessened, only ending up on five cards (one black, one red, and three green). "Graveyard as resource" mostly moved out of red and became more of a Zombie-themed thing in blue and black. The "getting back cards out of your graveyard" theme ended up being black and green.</p>
</div>

<h2>"DEATH MATTERS"</h2>

<p>Another discovery of exploring the graveyard is the importance of death in horror. We wanted things dying to matter, so we chose to use our second mechanic to care about death. The ability word, named deathwatch, cares about whether something has died.</p>

<p>Deathwatch comes in two versions. The first version consists of spells (including creatures) that are better when cast if something has already died that turn. The second version consists of permanents with activations that could only be used if something has died. Too many of the first version warped the environment, making players afraid to block, so we cut down on those types of deathwatch card, and lessened their as-fan, moving some up to higher rarities.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Deathwatch obviously became morbid. Development ended up doing very little of the second and more of the first.</p>
</div>

<p>We tried to give a different flavor to each of the colors that use it:</p>

<ul>
	<li>White: This color does not have any deathwatch to help set up the humans versus monsters feel.</li>
	<li>Blue: This color has deathwatch spells that cannot be played unless something has died.</li>
	<li>Black: This color has permanents with deathwatch that have an "enters the battlefield" effect if something has died.</li>
	<li>Red: This color has instants and sorceries with deathwatch that get stronger in effect if something has died.</li>
	<li>Green: This color has creatures with deathwatch that come into play with extra +1/+1 counters if something has died.</li>
</ul>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Morbid ended up mainly in black and green with a single red card and wasn't divided in effect by color as we'd specified here.</p>
</div>

<p>All four colors that get deathwatch also have permanents with deathwatch activations.</p>

<p>In addition to deathwatch, there are also permanents with "carnage" (effects that trigger off creatures dying, not an ability or keyword). Like deathwatch, "carnage" is restricted to nonwhite cards.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">The set did have a bunch of death triggers, and they showed up in all the colors, including white.</p>
</div>

<h2>TRANSFORMATION</h2>

<p>Another key part of horror we felt was transformation. Horror was full of seemingly innocent things transforming into horrific things. To capture this element of horror, we created double-sided cards. They were based on a successful series of cards designed for <em>Duel Masters</em>.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">The term later got changed to double-faced cards because even normal <em>Magic </em>cards have two sides.</p>
</div>

<p>The double-sided cards are cards with two sides that each represent a creature ("Rattle" is going to play around with double-sided cards that are things other than creatures—note that "Shake" does have a double-sided planeswalker at mythic, currently a Werewolf.) Both sides have a mana cost, so either can be cast. The casted side is then put into play.</p>

<p>All the double-sided cards in "Shake" have an A side (most often the smaller side) that can transform into the B side. Some, including all the Werewolves, can transform back into the A side. Note that other than Werewolves, no common cards transform from B side to A side. The word "transform" is a keyword action that means to turn the card over to the other side.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Yes, we had intended for <em>Innistrad</em> to be the premier of a Werewolf planeswalker, but the slot ended up going to Garruk to show him being cursed by the Chain Veil.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">One of the interesting things about going back and reading old documents is that you get reminded of things you forgot. I did not remember that when we'd handed off the set, we had our double-faced cards function not just as transforming double-faced cards (TDFCs) but also modal double-faced cards (MDFCs). More on this below.</p>
</div>

<p>While we didn't have a mana cost on the B side for a long time, we chose to add it for two major reasons. First, without it, the cards are mechanically almost identical to <em>Kamigawa</em>'s flip cards (although with more text than would fit on them—also, we believe strongly that they have a very different feel about them, which does a much better job of capturing the duality). Second, not having a mana cost on the B side forces us to define the color of the card in the text of every card.</p>

<p>Our current suggestion for how double-sided cards should be used is as such: Players may play directly with them if they are playing with opaque sleeves. If they do not want to play with opaque sleeves, we are providing a checklist card that serves as a replacement for the double-sided card while it is in any zone other than on the battlefield.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">For a good chunk of design, the DFCs were just TDFCs, but we turned them into a combined version of TDFCs and MDFCs to make them feel newer and solve the color definition problem.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Now that I'm digging into the recesses of my memory, I believe we did this shortly before the handoff and it got changed back shortly after they went into development. I think the thought was that the cards were complex enough as is, so they felt very different from the <em>Kamigawa</em> block flip cards, and we came up with the color indicator to solve the "what color is the back" issue. This was the point where I shelved the MDFCs, promising one day I'd find a home for them.</p>
</div>

<p>It is my belief that the double-sided cards are the key selling point of the set. The design team spent a great amount of time trying to make all the transformations as resonant as possible. Whenever we did a trope that had a recognizable name, I used the name (such as Dr. Jekyll &amp; Mr. Hyde) not because they will be that exact name, but because I wanted everyone to know the intended trope.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Earlier in design, the plan had been for players to have a one-faced card in your deck that specifically fetched the double-faced card and put it onto the battlefield. When the printers couldn't promise matching up the two cards in packs, we moved to the version we have now.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Of everything in this handoff, the TDFCs were by far the most contentious part of the design. There was a segment of R&amp;D that firmly believed they shouldn't be in the product. Luckily, Aaron Forsythe, my boss, understood their value to the product and backed me in keeping them in the set. For those who don't know the history, the TDFCs did go on to be a very popular part of the set.</p>
</div>

<h2>MISCELLANEOUS</h2>

<p>The set has a few other features that didn't fall into any of the above categories:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Curses</strong> – These are enchant-player enchantments that all do bad things to the enchanted. Curses exist in every color but white and are highest in number in black and blue.</li>
</ul>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Erik didn't quite understand that it was important to me that every color but white got a curse, so he didn't replace the green curse when he cut it in development. This is a good example of where things get missed if you don't emphatically state them. For example, I merely stated here that we had done it but not that we did it with a particular goal in mind.</p>
</div>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Devils</strong> – The goblins have been replaced in red by Devils. Other than a joke reference on Pitchfork (which Brady says will have to go away), the Devil creature type is not tribal in any way. The Devils have a mischievous, destructive quality and are only in red mostly on smaller goblin-sized creatures.</li>
</ul>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">The Devils did stay but ended up only being on three cards. I have no memory of what the joke reference on Pitchfork was.</p>
</div>

<h2>SECONDARY THEMES</h2>

<p>To help build some depth for Limited play and round out the set, each color had a secondary theme.</p>

<p><strong>White</strong>:<strong> Fighting Monsters</strong> – White's subtheme is all about white fighting against everyone else. Some of this shows up in several spells and effects that target nonwhite things. White also has cards specifically designed to deal with each of the different monster tribes' tactics.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">The general essence of this stayed but changed from non-white to non-Human or spelling out monster tribes.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Blue</strong>:<strong> Milling</strong> – Blue's milling is, in this set, mostly used to mill oneself to take advantage of the things that care about cards in graveyards (including, among other things, flashback and blue Zombies).</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This theme stayed. I think Erik upped the amount of milling.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Black</strong>:<strong> Graveyard Recursion</strong> – Black is the best color at getting back its resources from the graveyard (green is the second best). This combines well with the "death matters" theme.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This theme got lessened a little but stayed.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Red</strong>:<strong> Graveyard as a Resource</strong> – Red has some spells that exile cards in the graveyard to use. This also combines well with "death matters."</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This theme mostly moved to blue and black Zombie cards with just one red card that did this.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Green</strong>:<strong> Creature Cards in Graveyard</strong> – Green has numerous cards that are strengthened based on how many creature cards are in your graveyard. This allows green to grow stronger over time and helps with the "death matters" theme.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This theme stayed.</p>
</div>

<h2>TWO-COLOR COMBINATIONS</h2>

<p>Here's why players would play each of the ten color-pair combinations in Limited:</p>

<p><strong>White-blue</strong>: Defensive Spirit deck<br />
<strong>Blue-black</strong>: Slow, plodding Zombie deck<br />
<strong>Black-red</strong>: Aggro Vampire deck<br />
<strong>Red-green</strong>: Mid-range Werewolf deck<br />
<strong>Green-white</strong>: Quick-building Human deck<br />
<strong>White-black</strong>: Humans combined with monsters that like to eat them<br />
<strong>Blue-red</strong>: Mill + Graveyard as Resource<br />
<strong>Black-green</strong>: Graveyard recursion<br />
<strong>Red-white</strong>: Other aggro option<br />
<strong>Green-blue</strong>: Mill + Caring about graveyards</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">The allied tribal archetypes basically stayed with some tweaking, while the enemy archetypes mostly changed. Erik and his team spent a lot of work on making cool and evocative enemy color archetypes.</p>
</div>

<p>I am very happy with all the work of my team and feel we have made a set with more top-down resonance than any other large expert expansion.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Of all the sets I've ever designed, <em>Innistrad </em>is in contention for my best ever, so it was fun looking back at this document and remembering what exactly we handed off. It definitely had a huge impact on how we did top-down sets following it. I should stress that another reason fewer things changed than often happens in vision design handoff documents is because <em>Innistrad </em>design lasted a year in contrast to the four months we get for vision design. A big thanks to my design team, Erik and his development team, and all the other people at Wizards who gave this set their all to make what has become a truly memorable <em>Magic</em> set.</p>
</div>

The document lays out the vision that the Vision Design team created for the set and spells out all the mechanics and themes that they've created thus far. I showed the <em>Throne of Eldraine </em>vision design document last fall (<a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/throne-eldraine-vision-design-handoff-part-1-2019-11-11" target="_blank">Part 1</a> and <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/throne-eldraine-vision-design-handoff-part-2-2019-11-18" target="_blank">Part 2</a>), and it was received well, so I thought I'd do the same with the <em>Ikoria </em>(called throughout the document by its codename "Cricket").</p>

<p>Two notes before we begin. One, everything not in a box below is the actual document as I wrote it two years ago. The boxes contain commentary for added insight into what was going on during vision design and/or commentary about how things would later be adapted during set design. Two, a lot changed during set design, so what you're seeing is the set as it was handed off. This is about as in the weeds and behind the scenes as it gets.</p>

<h1>"Cricket" Vision Design Handoff Document</h1>

<p><strong>Vision Design team</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Mark Rosewater (lead)</li>
	<li>Andrew Veen</li>
	<li>Corey Bowen</li>
	<li>Dave Humpherys</li>
	<li>Peter Lee</li>
</ul>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">I always start by introducing the Vision Design team. I usually also introduce our Creative team partners, but I left it off this document as it was a little complicated. Sam Burley originated the idea and led the concept push. Andrew Vallas was the main art director for the world guide and commissioning, and Cynthia Sheppard and Dawn Mirren commissioned some of the pieces after Andrew left. Doug Beyer was the creative lead (worldbuilding, concepting, and creative text).</p>
</div>

<p>Every set has a core identity, and "Cricket" is about monsters—making monsters, playing with monsters, bonding with monsters—mayhem with Monsters.</p>

<p>The vision for the set, including all its mechanics, came out of a desire to dedicate a set to monsters and bring it to life.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">I also always start my document by stressing what makes this set different from every other set. One of the most important parts of vision design is setting a clear vision for what the set is about, so everyone downstream is all working toward the same goal. You can see right out of the gate that I stressed that <em>Ikoria </em>was all about monsters.</p>
</div>

<p>There were a few challenges to overcome:</p>

<p><strong>1. <em>Magic </em>normally has monsters. How does this set stand apart as particularly being about monsters?</strong></p>

<p><strong>2. Monsters tend to be large, making them skew higher in mana cost and rarity. How do we keep focus on the theme when the default <a href="http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/state-design-2017-2017-08-28#as-fan" target="_blank">as-fan</a> is so low?</strong></p>

<p><strong>3. The traditional gameplay with monsters is ramp. How can we create a variety of play patterns while still staying true to our theme?</strong></p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Another thing I tend to do early in my vision design handoff documents is talk about what the major challenges are. I want to make sure everyone involved understands what they're signing up for when they tackle the vision that I'm presenting them.</p>
</div>

<p>Here's how we approached answering each of these questions.</p>

<p>1. This set had to have more monsters than normal. Vision Design needed to figure out how to do that, most likely through our choice of mechanics.</p>

<p>2. We needed to figure out a way to get smaller and cheaper monsters as well as find more ways to justify having more large monsters in your deck than normal.</p>

<p>3. Part of finding new ways to get monsters in the set was building in new play patterns with them. We knew one of the ways we wanted to do this was to make the monsters over time.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">I don't just want to tell the Set Design team what we did. I want to explain why we did it. We made a lot of individual choices, and it's important that I walk them through what factors shaped those choices. In <em>Ikoria</em>, this had a lot to do with how <em>Magic </em>has treated monsters in the past and what we had to do differently to make a monster-focused set. It's common to take a theme we normally do in small volumes and crank it up to make it the major theme. This requires us looking at how we usually handle it and understand what happens when we change how much of it we're doing. Monsters, normally, are big and splashy, but low in number. If those are the only things monsters were in this set, we'd quickly paint ourselves into a corner.</p>
</div>

<h1>Making Monsters</h1>

<p>We wanted some kind of monster evolution, so we examined the various ways we could handle it.</p>

<p>The lowest-hanging fruit was a series of creatures that evolved from one another. Play Creature A. It can evolve into Creature B, which can then evolve into Creature C. This had a number of issues, the biggest two being difficulty in consistently making it happen and the repetition of play when you do. We decided we wanted to create a more fluid evolution where various creatures could evolve into others. We also liked the idea that this evolution had some variance built into it.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">It was clear from day one that doing a monster set correctly would require evolution. One, it helped us get small monsters, so we could fill out the creature curve. Two, it allowed the monsters to be more impactful as the game progressed. Three, it added a lot of unique flavor that played into the source material and would make the set feel different from other <em>Magic </em>sets.</p>
</div>

<h1>Keyword Counters</h1>

<p>That's when we remembered something that had been created during the Design Hackathon just a few weeks earlier. We were exploring what we could do with the punch-out technology that <em>Amonkhet </em>had used. One idea that we came up with was keyword counters where counters represented the permanent granting of a keyword. A +1/+1 counter grants a creature +1/+1. A flying counter would grant it flying.</p>

<p>The "Cricket" Vision Design team examined all the evergreen keywords and picked out the ones we thought would be useful:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Deathtouch</li>
	<li>First strike</li>
	<li>Flying</li>
	<li>Lifelink</li>
	<li>Menace</li>
	<li>Reach</li>
	<li>Trample</li>
	<li>Vigilance</li>
</ul>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Interestingly, all eight of these keyword creature types made it through to print.</p>
</div>

<p>The evergreen keywords we didn't use:</p>

<p><strong>Defender </strong>– It seemed wrong to grant a negative keyword.</p>

<p><strong>Double strike </strong>– We didn't think we wanted to use it enough to justify the counter.</p>

<p><strong>Haste </strong>– It wasn't synergistic with our mutate mechanic, which I'll get to in a minute.</p>

<p><strong>Hexproof </strong>– We were worried that granting hexproof too much would make for unfair gameplay.</p>

<p><strong>Indestructible </strong>– We didn't think we wanted to use it enough to justify the counter.</p>

<p><strong>Prowess </strong>– The ability stacks, and we were trying to avoid keyword counters that you would want multiples of on the same creature. There's also a lot of talk about removing prowess as an evergreen keyword.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Hexproof is the only one here to make it into the main set. This was done because we needed to have a second option for blue other than flying, and the Vision Design team's attempt to solve this problem (see below) didn't end up working out. Double strike and indestructible did end up becoming keyword counters in an accompanying Commander deck.</p>
</div>

<p>Realizing we were shy in blue keywords, we ended up adding two new keywords:</p>

<p><strong>Sneaky </strong>– "Creatures with power 3 or greater can't block this creature." (Used in blue and black.)</p>

<p><strong>Resistance </strong>– "Spells or abilities that target a creature with this ability cost 2 more." This was designed not to stack. (Used in green and blue.)</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">To solve the blue issue, we made two new keywords that could work in blue. Set Design ultimately decided they only wanted to use evergreen keywords on the keyword counters, so we dropped these two and picked up hexproof. We did talk about whether we'd want to make either of these two into an evergreen keyword, but we decided it shouldn't be to just get another keyword counter for <em>Ikoria</em>.</p>
</div>

<p>The Vision Design team is handing off a suggestion of ten keyword counters, but the logistics will allow more. The things to watch out for are having enough options for all the colors and not stacking. Every color combination is covered with the exception of blue-red.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">We did try very hard during vision design to have ten keyword counters, one that overlapped each two-color pair, but prowess not working out left a gap in blue-red. The Set Design team decided just to print nine.</p>
</div>

<p>Keyword counters are being used in several ways:</p>

<p><strong>Mutate </strong>– More on this in a moment.</p>

<p><strong>Spell effects </strong>– Any place we would grant a keyword ability until end of turn we instead put a keyword counter on the creature.</p>

<p><strong>Versatile creatures </strong>– These are creatures that give you a choice of keyword counters when the creature enters the battlefield. There is a common cycle that gives you two choices and some higher rarity cards that give you more than two choices.</p>

<p><strong>Trainers </strong>– This is an uncommon cycle of humanoids (non-monsters) that put a specific keyword counter on another creature when they enter the battlefield and then have an activated ability that can affect a creature with that ability.</p>

<p><strong>Cycling </strong>– We have an uncommon creature cycle with cycling. If you cycle the card, you get to put a keyword counter on target creature that has the ability on the creature.</p>

<p><strong>Monstrosity </strong>– There are a number of spells that use the monstrosity ability to grant a keyword counter rather than a +1/+1 counter. These cards could be done without the monstrosity keyword, but the flavor seems like such a homerun for this set.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Everything above actually came to pass with two exceptions. One, mutate changed during set design to no longer directly interact with keyword counters, and two, monstrosity ended up not being used in the set. At the time of this document, I didn't believe the cards would actually be printed with the monstrosity keyword, but we left it on so that Set Design could make the call. That whole style of card, creatures that upgrade themselves with keywords for mana, ended up not getting made. They were pretty cool though, so maybe in the future if creature keywords return.</p>
</div>

<h1>Mutate</h1>

<p>Mutate is the keyword we're using to let players build their own monsters. Here is the current rules text for it:</p>

<p><em>If you cast this spell for its mutate cost, it becomes overlaid on target creature you own that shares a creature type or inheritable keyword with it. Put counters on it for that creature's inheritable keywords.</em></p>

<p>There is a bunch of new vocabulary introduced in this reminder text, so let me walk through how exactly this works. A creature with mutate is a normal creature with a mana cost that can be cast normally. All creatures with mutate costs will be represented as "monsters" from this world. Creatures with mutate have a second cost called a mutate cost which allows you to play the creature (most often) for a lower mana cost.</p>

<p>To use a mutate card, you must overlay an existing creature you own on the battlefield that shares either the creature type or a keyword with the mutate creature. For example, if you have Winged Cat, a 2/3 Cat with flying, as your mutate creature, you can overlay a creature that is a Cat or that has flying (or both). Overlay means that you put the card directly on top of the card being overlaid and the creature is now considered to have changed to the stats of the mutate creature. An overlaid creature is considered the same creature, so any quality of the original creature is shared by the mutated creature, including tap state, summoning sickness state, and any attachment or counter. If another spell or effect causes the mutated creature to change zones, it and all cards overlaid underneath it go to the new zone. For example, you mutate a Beast with your mutated Beast. It then gets unsummoned. Both the original Beast and the mutated Beast would go to their owner's hand.</p>

<p>Two other things happen when you mutate. One, any inheritable keyword (defined as a keyword that exists as a keyword counter) on the overlaid creature turns into a keyword counter on the mutated creature. Two, all mutate cards have an effect if you mutate them into play. Here's an example. You have Winged Cat, a 2/3 flying Cat with mutate. When it mutates, you put a +1/+1 counter onto Winged Cat. You have Watch Cat, a 2/2 Cat with vigilance, on the battlefield. You mutate Watch Cat into Winged Cat. As Watch Cat has vigilance, Winged Cat gets a vigilance counter. As you mutated it, you also put a +1/+1 counter on it. Winged Cat is now a 3/4 creature with flying and vigilance.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Mutate is a great example of how a mechanic changes through the process. Vision Design felt it was important to have evolution as an element of a monster set. For a combination of gameplay, novelty, flavor, and variance reasons, we liked the idea that you built your monster over time. To do that, we created the mutate mechanic. This document explained the philosophy of what we were doing. Set Design then found ways to improve upon the mechanic while staying true to the essence of why the mechanic was in the set.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This involved two big changes. One, they expanded the criteria upon which you were allowed to mutate. Vision Design had limited it to a creature that shared a creature type or keyword. We were doing this partly for flavor and partly to hold in comprehension complexity, but Set Design found the strategic complexity of tracking what you could and couldn't mutate made playing, drafting, and deck building with mutate too difficult, so they pulled back first to any creature and ultimately to any non-Human creature. This change also allowed us to move away from the concept of "inheritable keywords," which was proving more complex to grasp for some players than we'd anticipated.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Second, they allowed the person mutating to choose which creature to put on top. Again, Vision Design had limited it to make the mechanic simpler, but Set Design found that allowing the option to put it on top or bottom of the creature being mutated opened up a lot of play value (a big reason why was the rule that the top creature defined all the non-rules-text elements of the card).</p>

<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">While those two changes obviously altered how the mechanic worked, you can see that the philosophy of what the mechanic represented (things like the mutated creature still being treated by the game as the same creature) carried through to the finished product.</p>
</div>

<p>Mutate is currently cycled in all its incarnations. Here are the cycles:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Common monocolor cycle </strong>that has a single keyword and grants a +1/+1 counter when it mutates.</li>
	<li><strong>Uncommon monocolor cycle </strong>that has a single keyword and grants a +1/+1 counter when it mutates.</li>
	<li><strong>Uncommon enemy color cycle </strong>that has no keywords and generates different effects when it mutates.</li>
	<li><strong>Rare monocolor cycle </strong>that has two keywords and generates different effects when it mutates.</li>
	<li><strong>Rare wedge color cycle </strong>that has one keyword and generates different effects when it mutates.</li>
	<li><strong>Mythic rare wedge color cycle </strong>that has two keywords and generates different effects when it mutates.</li>
</ul>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Interestingly, while the cycles changed in certain ways, dropping the keywords because they no longer mattered mechanically and moving toward more variety of effects at low rarities (the vision design had done +1/+1 counters at lower rarities to simplify things), all of the above cycles, save the rare wedge cycle, actually stayed in the set. Set Design added in one more cycle, a second uncommon monocolor cycle that has an effect that scales based on how many times you've mutated, as well a few individual mutate cards.</p>
</div>

<p>There are five primary creature types associated with mutate:</p>

<p><strong>Cat </strong>(primary in white, but appearing on creatures in red, white, and black)</p>

<p><strong>Elemental </strong>(primary in blue, but appearing on creatures in green, blue, and red)</p>

<p><strong>Nightmare </strong>(primary in black, but appearing on creatures in white, black, and green)</p>

<p><strong>Dinosaur </strong>(primary in red, but appearing on creatures in blue, red, and white)</p>

<p><strong>Beast </strong>(primary in green, but appearing on creatures in black, green, and blue)</p>

<p>Every mutate card is the creature types of the color it's centered in. All white mutate creatures are Cats. All white-black mutate creatures are Cat Nightmares. All red-white-black mutate creatures are Cat Nightmare Dinosaurs. Monocolor mutate creatures have another creature type which comes from a secondary list. This secondary list (which Set Design is going to create) is designed to help Set Design make mutate creatures work with other creatures in Standard. Being primary in a creature type means you have a higher count and as-fan, although the creature type will also show up in your other wedge colors.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">While these five creature types do remain centered in certain colors and in certain wedges (showing up on a monocolor common and all the gold cards with mutate), the final product is not as all-in as the vision design suggested. This is basically due to the disconnect between the creature type and the mutate requirement that happened during set design.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">I would like to point out the secondary list that I talk about. One of the challenges with doing tribal themes is making sure that the sets around it can help with those themes. Our solution was to have other creature types show up on creatures (as weird combinations of creature types was a thing this set did) that we could make sure matched other sets around <em>Ikoria</em>. Vision Design doesn't just have to think about how to make this set work in a vacuum, but how to make it work in the larger context of all the <em>Magic </em>sets we're making.</p>
</div>

<p>The one last thing to mention about mutate creatures is what happens if the creature they're mutating gets destroyed from under them as they are mutating. My Winged Cat targets my Watch Cat to mutate it, but the Watch Cat gets <a class="autocard-link" data-image-url="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Shock" href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock">Shock</a>ed in response. The Winged Cat still enters the battlefield, but it doesn't mutate, meaning it won't pick up any attributes from the creature—in this case, it won't get a vigilance keyword counter and won't be free from summoning sickness (and it wouldn't get any enchantments, equipment, or counters on the Watch Cat)—and the effect that happens when it mutates (the +1/+1 counter in this case) doesn't happen. Winged Cat would enter as a 2/3 flier with summoning sickness and not a 3/4 creature with flying and vigilance that can attack right away.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">We talked with Play Design early about this to make the cards more resilient to card disadvantage, and it didn't change throughout set design.</p>
</div>

<h1>Covenants (Formerly Called Archetype)</h1>

<p>Mutate lets you build a monster, but that means those monsters are going to be hybrids of different creatures. We knew we wanted some trope-y monsters like King Kong that are more singular in nature, so we set out to find a mechanic that would let us make some of those. Also, to play into the "bonding with your monster" theme, we liked the idea of a mechanic that felt as if the monster and you had some special connection.</p>

<p>The solution to this problem also came from the Design Hackathon, a mechanic that we're currently calling covenant. A creature with covenant can be played as normal, but if your deck meets a certain deck-construction condition (such as having a Singleton deck or having half the deck be basic lands), the creature can be exiled before the start of the game (or possibly going to the command zone). For purposes of deck construction, the covenant creature is counted as being in your deck. You will then be able to cast it during the game as if it were in your hand. You may only have one covenant creature per restriction, but a deck can meet numerous restrictions to include multiple covenant creatures. All covenant creatures are flavored as monsters.</p>

<p>In the file as handed off, we have two cycles of covenant creatures, one at uncommon and one at rare. The uncommon cycle was designed for Draft with deck-construction build-arounds we think are possible much of the time. The rare cycle was designed with Constructed in mind, both casual and tournament. Some of them are possible in Draft, but that isn't their focus. The covenants were planned for all five colors, but they don't necessarily need to be cycled (meaning they don't have to exist in a power of five) and there is probably room for some more. <span class="spoiler">Note from the editor: No really, we removed this text. You can't see it. It isn't ready for you. You may find out soon enough, but now is not the time.</span></p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Companion was in the set at vision design handoff, but there were numerous changes made during set design. One, Vision Design made all the cards monocolor. They would all change to hybrid during set design to up their flexibility to fit into more different decks. Two, Vision Design made one cycle at uncommon, designed for Draft, and one cycle at rare, aimed more at Constructed. Set Design found the uncommons warping Draft a little too much and moved the uncommon cycle up to rare. That also allowed a full ten-card cycle of hybrid. Three, during vision design, we only let you play one of any companion but you could play as many companions as your deck allowed. Further playtesting would show that it was too strong, and the rule got changed to allow you only one companion per game. You can also see that a lot of details, like where the companion exists before you cast it, were still up in the air at the time. (It would eventually be outside the game or in the sideboard.) Also, the King Kong-inspired card ended up not being made as a companion.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">The censored line is just me talking about something future-facing that's not public yet.</p>
</div>

<h1>Cycling</h1>

<p>We had room for one last mechanic, and we were hoping, as normal, to have it be a returning mechanic (we like to try and have one old mechanic per set if possible). As this is the monster set, we were looking for something that would let us get even more monsters into decks. Cycling proved to be the perfect choice, as it lets us make big creatures that you can cycle away if you can't cast them yet. This allows players to get a higher density of monsters in their deck.</p>

<p>Because mutate and covenant are both splashy and have some complication (especially mutate), we chose not to stretch cycling design too much. Here are the few things we've done with it:</p>

<p><strong>Twobrid cycling </strong>– At rare, we have a cycle of powerful enchantments (this year's two themes that cross all the sets are monocolor and enchantments) that each cycle for twobrid mana (2 or M).</p>

<p><strong>Uncommon cycling enchantments </strong>– Uncommon also has a cycle of cycling global enchantments, things that are good in Limited.</p>

<p><strong>Keyword counters </strong>– There is an uncommon cycle of creatures with a keyword that puts that keyword counter on target creature when they cycle.</p>

<p><strong>Cycling matters </strong>– In red and white, we have several cards that care about when cards are cycled. This was designed as a Draft theme for these two colors.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Half of these made it into the set. The twobrid costs were considered unnecessary in a set that was already packed to the gills with stuff. The uncommon cycling enchantments also went away for space. I'll just point out that you can see me stressing possible themes for overlap with earlier sets in the year. The cycling cycle and the cycling-matters cards did stick around.</p>
</div>

<h1>Non-Monsters</h1>

<p>While the monsters are the key focus, not everyone in "Cricket" is a monster. The world also has humanoid creatures that are meant to interact with the monsters in various ways—some bond with them, some hunt them, some run away screaming when they come near. Because mutate cares about keyword mechanics, we've made the choice not to put any keyword mechanics on non-monsters. This allows for us not to mutate non-monsters into monsters within the dome of Limited (that's <em>Innistrad</em>'s gig). Note that you can put a keyword counter on a non-monster and then mutate it, but that's a two-step process that allows us creatively to never have to show it. The humanoid creatures can have enters-the-battlefield effects, death triggers, activated abilities, triggered abilities, non-keyworded abilities—anything but creature keywords.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">You can see that while Vision Design executed it differently, the idea that the Humans didn't mutate into monsters was baked into the set from the beginning. I will say, designing the humanoid creatures not to have keywords was an interesting design challenge.</p>
</div>

<h1>Multicolor in "Cricket"</h1>

<p>The final thing to talk about is the use of multicolor in "Cricket." The plan was to have a wedge theme at high rarities for Constructed purposes to take advantage of the mana from <em>Guilds of Ravnica </em>block, which will rotate out with Diving (<em>Zendikar Rising</em>). Here's how multicolor shows up in "Cricket."</p>

<p><strong>Common enemy hybrid cycle </strong>– To help Limited without having common gold creatures, common has a cycle of hybrid creatures. As they are two colors, they have both relevant creature types.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This cycle went away. This cycle existed to make sure we had enough of an as-fan of each of the five relevant creature types. We also wanted to make sure there was enough variance so that all the decks didn't look the same. I do want to stress that Vision Design handed off the set using hybrid mana, just not in the structure that eventually saw print.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Uncommon enemy mutate cycle </strong>– These are enemy color mutate creatures without any keyword but a mutate spell effect.</p>

<p><strong>Uncommon enemy creature cycle </strong>– These are enemy color creatures that play into the two-color Draft archetype.</p>

<p><strong>Uncommon enemy noncreature cycle </strong>– These are flavorful enemy color noncreature spells.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">The uncommon enemy mutate cycle and the enemy noncreature cycle stayed in. The uncommon enemy creature cycle turned into a ten-card two-color Draft archetype cycle, something we do in most sets. The Set Design team also added an uncommon hybrid ally creature cycle.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Rare enemy mutate cycle </strong>– These are wedge color creatures with one keyword and a powerful mutate spell effect. They have a higher mutate cost than mana cost.</p>

<p><strong>Rare enemy spell cycle </strong>– These are wedge color instants and sorceries.</p>

<p><strong>Rare enchantment cycle </strong>– These are three-drop wedge color enchantments.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">The rare wedge enchantment cycle stayed, and the rare wedge spell cycle turned into the Ultimatums. The rare wedge mutate cycle got cut, but the Set Design team added a few other rare cycles: an ally color creature cycle, an enemy color legendary creature cycle, and a ten-card hybrid companion cycle.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Mythic rare enemy mutate cycle </strong>– These are wedge color creatures with two keywords and a very powerful mutate spell effect. They have a mutate cost that costs 1MM (hybrid mana) where M is the primary color and the hybrid mana is the other two colors.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This cycle mostly stayed with just a few small tweaks. The mutate costs kept their mana-color requirements but varied as to how much generic mana they required, and the creatures no longer had to have exactly two keywords, as the keywords-matter theme for mutate went away.</p>
</div>

<h1>In Conclusion</h1>

<p>That's everything to convey about "Cricket." The Vision Design team is very proud of what we've created and hope the Set Design team can turn it into an amazing set. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Like I talked about last time I posted a vision design handoff document, this is just one means by which I communicate with the Set Design team. Usually, I also give a talk to them and am open when questions pop up.</p>
</div>

<p>That's <em>Ikoria</em>'s vision design handoff document. I hope you found it interesting. I'm planning to continue posting these in the future as long as people keep communicating that they want to see them. As always, I'm eager to hear your feedback on today's column, the vision design handoff documents, or <em>Ikoria</em>. You can <a href="mailto:making.magic@hotmail.com">email me</a> or contact me through any of my social media accounts (<a href="https://twitter.com/maro254" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://markrosewater.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Tumblr</a>, <a href="http://instagram.com/mtgmaro" target="_blank">Instagram</a>, and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@markrosewater">TikTok</a>).</p>

<p>Join me next week when I answer your questions about <em>Ikoria: Lair of the Behemoths</em>.</p>

<p>Until then, may you enjoy digging deep behind the scenes.</p>

I write these documents to help explain our vision portion of the design to the Set Design team when it's time to hand it off to them. <em>Throne of Eldraine</em>'s articles went over quite well, so I also posted them for <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/ikoria-vision-design-handoff-2020-05-04"><em>Ikoria</em></a>, <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/zendikar-rising-vision-design-handoff-document-2020-09-28"><em>Zendikar Rising</em></a>, and <em>Strixhaven</em> (<a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/strixhaven-vision-design-handoff-document-part-1-2021-04-19">Part 1</a> and <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/strixhaven-vision-design-handoff-document-part-2-2021-04-26">Part 2</a>). Last fall, I decided it might be fun to show readers some handoff documents from the past and did <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/original-zendikar-design-handoff-document-part-1-2020-10-12">an article for original<em> Zendikar</em></a>. Since that went over well, too, I'm digging into the past again today.</p>

<p><em>Modern Horizon 2</em> previews start next week, so I thought it would be fun to go back and look at one of the sets that inspired it. I've chosen <em>Future Sight</em> because that's the set from <em>Time Spiral</em> block for which I led the design (and, thus, have the document).</p>

<p>A few caveats before we begin:</p>

<ol>
	<li>How these documents are put together has changed a bunch over time, so this one is a little different than the recent ones I've posted. (For example, no sample cards.) I believe this document was handed over in spring of 2006.</li>
	<li>This was back when R&amp;D had the design/development model, so I'd spent more time on the set than I do on vision design (closer to a year in contrast to the four months I get now), which means the set was much further along.</li>
	<li>The text below is the actual document as it was turned in. Everything in the boxes consists of my notes, which explain things to help you get some larger context.</li>
</ol>

<h1>"Pop" Design Document</h1>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Future Sight's codename was "Pop" because "Snap," "Crackle," and "Pop" are the codenames for the sets from <em>Time Spiral </em>block. Nowadays, I list my design team in the document, but I didn't do this back in 2006. The <em>Future Sight</em> design team was myself (as the lead), Matt Cavotta, Devin Low, Mark Gottlieb, Ryan Miller, and Zvi Mowshowitz (the future Hall-of-Famer was a contractor at the time).</p>
</div>

<p>Let's begin this document by facing the biggest question head on. This set is supposed to be the future. Yet the cards exist now. How can the set be about the future when every set introduces new things to the players that they've never seen before? The answer is context. We are not trying to show the actual future as much as we are trying to create something that feels like the future.</p>

<p>The trick to doing this is to play into the core concept of this block: nostalgia. "Pop's" glimpse into the future is a look into an extrapolated future. That is, "Pop's" future is defined by how it advances the past. When a science-fiction film wants to show the future, they like to pepper in futurized versions of known brands, for example. This gives the audience a sense of familiarity, making them feel more anchored in the futuristic setting.</p>

<p>They used this technique in <em>Demolition Man, </em>which portrayed a certain well-known restaurant chain as the only survivor of "The Franchise Wars." We see the logo on the restaurant sign, and though it's future-styled, we recognize it, and we're there. They could have just made up a fictitious brand for the film, but they knew it would resonate more if the name was a known quantity (and, yes, I'm sure they got paid for it, too, but I believe their reasons for doing this went beyond product endorsement).</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">I'm guessing few of you expected me to reference the movie <em>Demolition Man</em> in a design document. When I can, I like to ground examples in real-world usages, especially within pop culture.</p>
</div>

<p>"Pop" is defined by how it takes known quantities and twists them. This is done in several different ways. I'll start with the timeshifted ones (note that a few of these appear in a lesser form in non-timeshifted cards):</p>

<p><strong>Evolutions</strong> – These are cards that take an existing mechanic and evolve it. The severity of the evolutions can go from simple (scry 3) to complex (an enchantment with morph). Most of the evolutions show up in the timeshifted cards, but a few of the simpler ones can be found on the non-timeshifted side (scry being the obvious example).</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Note that this is before scry was evergreen. Each set in the <em>Time Spiral</em> block had an old mechanic that it focused on to hit "past," "present," or "future," and I chose scry to represent "future." There was a vertical morph cycle with an enchantment (common), land (uncommon), and artifact (rare) with morph.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Keyword Extensions</strong> – This is an offshoot of evolutions. Keyword extensions are new keywords that twist an existing keyword. An example from <em>Magic</em>'s past would be land cycling, as it's a riff on cycling. The keyword has a new name, but a root of the old mechanic is included to hint to the players that there is some similarity (and help them more easily understand how the new mechanic works). Examples in "Pop" include deathstorm and activation convoke.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Deathstorm became gravestorm, and activation convoke (which is convoke but usable on activations if that's not clear) didn't end up making it to print.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>New Keywords</strong> – The "Pop" team chose to exclude new keywords from the non-timeshifted cards. We did this to allow us to use all our "new keyword points" toward new keywords on the timeshifted cards.</p>

<p>We also made a conscious choice to help promote the sense that the timeshifted cards are from all over the future to limit ourselves to no more than two uses of any new keyword. The majority of the new keywords actually appear once. The new keywords were selected as they were interesting keywords that fell into the realm of obvious things we might do. Truly innovative keywords that broke into virgin territory that we felt could later be used as an important marketing hook were not included. Later I will walk through the cards and keywords that we intended for use in the future.</p>

<p>Finally, note that not every card we keyworded with a new keyword necessarily needs a keyword. As you'll see below, some new keywords specifically serve a purpose, but for most of the keywords, the development should decide whether it needs to be a keyword.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">The development team moved forward with upping the number of a few new keywords. Delve, for example, had three cards. The idea of doing this many new keywords in a single set was pretty crazy back then and seems even crazier now. Sixteen new keywords were introduced in <em>Future Sight</em>. Four of them (deathtouch, lifelink, reach, and shroud) were meant to be their introduction to evergreen, (shroud would later be replaced by hexproof), but still, that's a lot for a single set.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">I will note that most of the new keywords were extrapolative, meaning they weren't messing with whole new concepts but rather taking known things and shifting them in some predictable way. Storm works with spells being cast, but what if we did something similar about things being put into the graveyard?</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Future Hints (Specific and Vague)</strong> – Some of the timeshifted cards were included to hint at areas we plan to take the game. A good example of this would be Scaredy Linx that keywords <a class="autocard-link" data-image-url="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Spirit+Link" href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spirit+Link">Spirit Link</a>. I'll explain these below. This category falls into two parts. Cards where we knew specifically where we're hinting from (I'll call these specific), and cards that are doing something we know we want to do but aren't tied to specific future sets (I'll call these vague). I will outline both below as well.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">I'd been wanting to keyword a bunch of effects we used in practically every set, and having them show up on futureshifted cards first felt like a cute way to introduce them. At the end of this document, I start spelling out what future we saw with all the futureshifted cards. You'll see what we specifically had planned versus what we thought we'd eventually do. The mechanic based on <a class="autocard-link" data-image-url="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Spirit+Link" href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spirit+Link">Spirit Link</a>, by the way, became lifelink.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Red Herrings</strong> – There is no way for us to hint at the future without also including some stuff that we specifically plan never to do. A bunch of the timeshifted cards toy with areas that I know we will never revisit. I'll also include these below. Note that the player reaction to these cards may very well change our minds.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Some of the hints were to things we had no plans to ever follow up on. In retrospect, I'm not sure that was a great idea, but it's very hard to come up with a large swath of mechanical space we haven't touched yet, so I think it was more out of necessity than desire.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Things from the Future</strong> – There a few cards that reinforce the idea that things are coming from the future. The older Jhoira card is a good example of this. These cards are not actually meant to be real future cards as much as something to play up the theme.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">The future theme needed to be supported creatively as much as mechanically, so we thought about that as we made cards. As with any design, we were in constant contact with the Creative team.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Miscellaneous</strong> – The last category is the catch-all for cards that feel right but don't quite fit any of the above categories.</p>

<p>And now we turn our attention to the types of cards used on the non-timeshifted cards:</p>

<p><strong>Mix-and-Match</strong> – While the timeshifted side makes use of showing where cards can evolve to, the non-timeshifted side makes use of combining known quantities together in ways the game never has before. The poster child for this is mix-and-match. These cards combine two keyword mechanics, always choosing two that have never been combined before (the majority of which come from two different blocks). To prevent keyword overload, the mix-and-match cards (as well as all the evolutions) are limited to keywords that are legal in Standard the day before "Pop" releases. The only exception is that "Pop" adds two old keywords, cycling and scry.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">While it might seem generous that I volunteer to only use mechanics in Standard, <em>Time Spiral</em> and <em>Planar Chaos</em> had brought back a whole bunch of mechanics. Scry was added as it was the "future" mechanic, and cycling just comboed too well with too many different mechanics not to use it in the mix-and-match set.</p>
</div>

<p>While the "weird and wacky" future cards will define the timeshifted cards, I believe that mix-and-match cards will define the non-timeshifted cards. I believe that mix-and-match delivers on an unspoken desire of players to see different parts of the game interact and allows us to hit design space that we literally can do nowhere else. 25 cards might seem on the high side, but I believe that the cards have enough diversity, will create enough good will, and will define the set to a high enough level that we want to keep them at a significant number. The mix-and-match cards have two cycles that I'll talk about below.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">I do love mix-and-match cards, and there just aren't a lot of places you can use them. I included more in the handoff than made it to print.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Future Dictates the Present</strong> – Another theme that plays into the future are cards that telegraph what they are going to do at some future known time, which forces players to react before said events happen. Both suspend and vanishing played up this theme in <em>Time Spiral</em> and <em>Planar Chaos</em>. "Pop" tries a few new tricks. We have suspend cards that keep going off every third turn. We have a cycle of common creatures that do nasty things if the opponent cannot deal with them in time. We have vanishing creatures with leaves-play effects. We have enchantments with delayed effects. I'll talk about a number of these in the cycles below.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">I had contemplated doing a cycle of cards based off the Double cycle from <em>Unglued</em> (spells that went off now and the start of the next game in the same match) but removed them from the file when I found out it was literally impossible to program into <em>Magic Online</em>.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Peer into the Future</strong> – The set has several cards (the largest amount having scry) that allow you to gain knowledge of what cards are coming. A few cards place cards on top or near the top of the library.</p>

<p><strong>Extensions of <em>Time Spiral</em> and/or <em>Planar Chaos</em> Mechanics</strong> – "Pop" expands upon many of the themes introduced in the first two sets. We have more of the following mechanics: suspend, vanishing, all the old keyword mechanics, split second, and flash.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">The third set in the block is where we experimented most with the mechanics of that block back in the days of us doing blocks.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Deal with the Consequences Later</strong> – There are a handful of cards (including a cycle of rare cards) that allow you to get something immediately but not worry about the cost until later. You know, in the future.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">I'm referring to the Pact cycle where you get to play the cards for free the turn you cast them but must pay for the spell on the following turn or lose the game. (This cycle was inspired by the <em>Unhinged </em>card <a class="autocard-link" data-image-url="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Rocket-Powered+Turbo+Slug" href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rocket-Powered+Turbo+Slug">Rocket-Powered Turbo Slug</a>.) <em>Future Sight</em> has a close relationship with the <em>Un-</em> sets.</p>
</div>

<p>As you can see, "Pop" creates the sense of the future by hitting upon a lot of different things that will read as the future to players.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Because this was a high-concept set, I wanted to spell out all the various ways we'd hit the feeling we were trying to capture.</p>
</div>

<p>Next, let's walk through the cycles in the set. Note that a lot of them are soft cycles that shouldn't be very obvious to the players. All the cycles (with a few exceptions) are among the non-timeshifted cards:</p>

<h2>Common</h2>

<p><strong>Mix-and-Match with Cycling</strong> – Each color has a mix-and-match involving cycling:</p>

<ul>
	<li>White: cycling and flashback</li>
	<li>Blue: cycling and recover</li>
	<li>Black: cycling and madness</li>
	<li>Red: cycling and echo</li>
	<li>Green: cycling and dredge</li>
</ul>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">I've said cycling combos well. Some of these mix-and-match combos got used, but the whole cycle didn't make it.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Mix-and-Match Miscellaneous</strong> – The second common cycle uses keywords that were not used in the first cycle (although, there are some duplicates among them because there is a shortage of creature abilities to choose from):</p>

<ul>
	<li>White: suspend and flanking</li>
	<li>Blue: suspend and shadow</li>
	<li>Black: shadow and hellbent</li>
	<li>Red: bloodthirst and flanking</li>
	<li>Green: convoke and kicker</li>
</ul>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">The green card, <a class="autocard-link" data-image-url="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Sprout+Swarm" href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sprout+Swarm">Sprout Swarm</a>, would later change over to convoke and buyback with not-so-great results. Elements of this cycle got used, but the cycle did not stay.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Seers</strong> – These are all 2C creatures with an optional but large sacrifice effect at the beginning of each upkeep. The idea is that the opponent has a turn to stop them. The cards are designed such that the effect of some you might occasionally be tempted not to use right away.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">These ended up becoming the Augurs.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Scry</strong> – There are a cycle of scry cards with different scry numbers (never 2) that have some other effect that interacts nicely with the scry effect.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">When scry first showed up in <em>Fifth Dawn</em>, all the cards were scry 2. <em>Future Sight</em> was the first set to use other scry numbers (and only the second set to use scry).<a id="spellshapers" name="spellshapers"></a></p>
</div>

<p><strong>Spellshapers</strong> – This cycle of spellshapers finishes off the <em>Time Spiral</em> block common cycles. These spellshapers make token creatures that are copies of famous creatures from <em>Magic</em>'s past. Note that the creature types line up with the creature types being used in "Peanut." Also, the white spellshaper, which is the only timeshifted card of the cycle, is making a Kithkin that comes out in "Peanut."</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">"Peanut" was <em>Lorwyn</em>. <em>Lorwyn</em> was a tribal set. At the point of this handoff, we knew what tribes <em>Lorwyn </em>cared about, so this cycle uses those creature types. The idea of making a token creature of a card not yet in print was planned in design. The problem we had at the time was that we wanted white to make a Kithkin, as that was white's main tribe in <em>Lorwyn</em>, but there wasn't a good Kithkin card from the past to use, so we thought outside the box.</p>
</div>

<h2>Uncommon</h2>

<p><strong>Mix-and-Match with Buyback</strong> – Each color has a mix-and-match involving buyback:</p>

<ul>
	<li>White: buyback and convoke</li>
	<li>Blue: buyback and scry</li>
	<li>Black: buyback and madness</li>
	<li>Red: buyback and storm</li>
	<li>Green: buyback and kicker</li>
</ul>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">A few of these mix-and-match combos got used, but this cycle didn't make it.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Mix-and-Match Miscellaneous</strong> – The second uncommon cycle consists of a collection of other mix-and-matches:</p>

<ul>
	<li>White: shadow and forecast</li>
	<li>Blue: transmute and flashback</li>
	<li>Black: vanishing and recover</li>
	<li>Red: morph and hellbent</li>
	<li>Green: vanishing and kicker</li>
</ul>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">I had Zvi take all the available mechanics and mix-and-match them, giving each a grade from one to five, with five being best. We included all the four and five combinations in the handoff. Many of those combinations made it to print.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Vanishing</strong> – There is a cycle of cards with vanishing, many of which have a leaves-play effect if the card leaves because the last time a counter was removed. Note that black and green's vanishing cards overlap with mix-and-match (one card covers both cycles in those colors).</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Some vanishing cards stayed, but this cycle did not.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Pulsing Suspend</strong> – This is a cycle of suspend cards that all re-suspend whenever they go off. All currently have a cost of 4CC and a suspend cost of 2C. All are suspend 3.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">The numbers were tweaked, but this cycle stayed.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Future Lands</strong> – This is a cycle of lands that each produce a color of mana and have a keyword. These cards were designed to match concepting art that Jeremy felt needed to be in the set (showing Dominaria recovering).</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This cycle also stayed in the set. The set also had a dual land cycle made up of cards from future unpublished dual land cycles. For some reason, it's not listed in this file, but I know we made it in design.</p>

<h2>Rare</h2>

<p><strong>Mix-and-Match Miscellaneous</strong> – This cycle just has cool mix-and-match cards that seemed big enough or confusing enough to want to be rare:</p>

<ul>
	<li>White: convoke and flash</li>
	<li>Blue: morph and vanishing</li>
	<li>Black: madness and hellbent</li>
	<li>Red: kicker and split second</li>
	<li>Green: suspend and vanishing</li>
</ul>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Most of this cycle's mix-and-match combinations stayed.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Maguses</strong> – This is a cycle to finish off the <em>Time Spiral</em> block cycles. Each magus is a famous enchantment put onto a creature.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This cycle stayed.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Credit Spells</strong> – This cycle includes all cards that cost 0 but force you to pay for them next turn (or else you lose the game). The design team talked about making the "pay next turn" optional but liked the fact that the spells forced you to plan your future to use them. Also, we liked a simple "lose the game" negative, as it played up the "you need to pay this" rather than "you need to work around this."</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">These are the Pacts I talked about above. These stayed in the set.</p>
</div>

<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>

<p><strong>Morph Vertical Cycle</strong> – There is a common morph card that's an enchantment, an uncommon that's a land, and a rare that's an artifact.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This vertical cycle stayed in the set.</p>
</div>

<p>Finally, let's walk through the timeshifted cards for an overview of what each one is doing and see what future it is hinting at:</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">All the futureshifted cards started their numbering at 11 for ease of separating non-futureshifted from futureshifted.</p>
</div>

<h2>White</h2>

<p><strong>cW11 Trained Pit Bull</strong> – Future Hint (Vague); I'm sure we'll reprint the vanilla card; not sure if we'll ever do the layout (the card has no text box; full art).</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This card was a vanilla creature (the first time a 3/1 appears for 1W) with a full-art frame. This ended up being turned into a full cycle because the set really needed some simpler futureshifted cards. I'm kind of shocked we haven't done this yet in a premier set.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>cW12 Full-Plate Paladin</strong> – New Keyword, Future Hint (Vague); I'm sure we'll do the armor mechanic. When we do, we'll use this clean version. I'm not sure exactly when we'll use it, but I predict in the next five blocks.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">The armor mechanic was renamed absorb. It was based on a mechanic we'd made for the <em>Star Wars Trading Card Game</em>. It ended up being a little too powerful and stalled the game too much to reuse in greater number.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>cW13 Mystic Quarry</strong> – Future Hint (Specific); this card is from the "Live," "Long," and "Prosper" block centered around land mechanics; we need to talk about this card, as decisions about it need to reflect a world with a bunch of them.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">We knew that <em>Zendikar</em> was coming up a few years down the line, so we were hinting at a "lands matter" set. This card was a land that tapped for white and had a sacrifice ability you could only use the turn you played it. It was an early idea of how to make a card a land <em>or</em> a spell. (Double-faced technology was many years away.)</p>
</div>

<p><strong>cW14 Living Castle</strong> – Evolution, Future Hint (Vague); I have no immediate plans to do noncreature morph, but it's definitely something we'll explore when we do morph again.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">"Definitely" proved to be a bit strong. <em>Khans of Tarkir</em> block explored doing noncreature morphs, but we decided against it after we got playtesting data. This card was basically <a class="autocard-link" data-image-url="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Lumithread+Field" href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lumithread+Field">Lumithread Field</a>.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>cW15 Hands Off</strong> – Red Herring; this is the card of a card that is humorous to do in isolation but would be annoying if too many cards had this many abilities.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This was an Aura that couldn't be countered, granted protection from black and red to the enchanted creature, and itself had protection from green and white. The idea was it had an answer to every threat to it. We didn't end up making it, but it was a very cute <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/vorthos-and-mel-2015-08-31" target="_blank">Mel design</a>.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>uW11 Underhillbilly</strong> – Miscellaneous; this card is finishing off the spellshaper cycle. The creature token this card is making is from "Peanut" (check with Aaron to make sure you link the two up). The other four spellshapers are all non-timeshifted and make creatures from the past. Note that all the creatures are supported creature types in "Peanut."</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">I talked about this <a href="#spellshapers">up above</a>.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>uW12 Rebel Pikeman</strong> – Evolution, Possibly Keyword Extension, Future Hint (Vague); we'll probably make this guy someday. Not in the near future, though.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This was a creature that had flanking twice. We definitely didn't make it in the near future.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>uW13 Astral Elemental</strong> – Evolution, New Keyword, Red Herring; while armor will be supported, I don't think we have plans to do enchantment creatures anytime soon.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This card became <a class="autocard-link" data-image-url="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Lucent+Liminid" href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lucent+Liminid">Lucent Liminid</a>, the first enchantment creature. The original card had armor 2 and granted armor 2 to your other creatures. Interestingly, enchantment creatures were something we did get to, although not for a number of years.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>uW14 Manhandle</strong> – Red Herring; I don't think we're planning to do activation convoke, but if it doesn't prove too wordy and the public likes it<nbsp>. . .</nbsp></p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Activation convoke didn't even make it to print, so the audience wasn't able to like it.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>uW15 Death Defiler</strong> – Evolution, Miscellaneous; this card exists to continue the Rebel theme in "Pop"; white is number two in reanimation (although a distant number two).</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This card let you return Rebels with mana value 3 or less from your graveyard to the battlefield. We haven't done much more with Rebels, but white has gotten better at reanimating small creatures.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>rW11 Meddling Monster</strong> – Evolution, Future Hint (Vague); we could easily do this guy in the future if players like him.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This was a 4/5 <a class="autocard-link" data-image-url="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Meddling+Mage" href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meddling+Mage">Meddling Mage</a>-like creature for 4WWW that let you choose a card type rather than a specific card. This didn't see print.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>rW12 Standing Alone</strong> – Future Hint (Vague); we wanted to put this card in Eighth but couldn't. Now we can put it anywhere we like. Also, I like the idea that in the future, we'll rename and re-concept popular <em>Un-</em> cards that can work in black-border <em>Magic</em>.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This card became <a class="autocard-link" data-image-url="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Barren+Glory" href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barren+Glory">Barren Glory</a>, but it was moved from futureshifted to non-futureshifted. The idea that <em>Un-</em> cards can be re-concepted and become black border was deemed not "future-y" enough.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>rW13 Gravetalk Sliver</strong> – Evolution, Miscellaneous; this card is here to fill out and twist the block's Sliver theme.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This was a Sliver that had the abilities of all dead Slivers. It didn't make it to print, but the futureshifted cards did have a cycle of Slivers with new abilities on them.</p>
</div>

<h2>Blue</h2>

<p><strong>cU11 Mystic Summoner</strong> – Evolution, Future Hint (Vague); we'll definitely do ____ cycling in the future.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This was the creature with Wizards cycling that became <a class="autocard-link" data-image-url="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Vedalken+%C3%86thermage" href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vedalken+%C3%86thermage">Vedalken Æthermage</a>. I'm again using "definitely" way too aggressively. R&amp;D moved away from doing tutoring mechanics, which is probably why we never explored __________cycling.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>cU12 Herald of the Future</strong> – Miscellaneous; this card is gray as to whether it even belongs as a timeshifted card; here to help block time counter theme.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This creature got +1/+1 for every card in play or in exile with a time counter on it. It never made it to print and probably wasn't worthy of being futureshifted.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>cU13 Mill Man</strong> – Miscellaneous; included as a scry (and milling) helper. Might do the mill half one day.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This is the early version of the card that would later become <a class="autocard-link" data-image-url="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Narcomoeba" href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Narcomoeba">Narcomoeba</a>. It got removed from the file, and I riffed on the idea when making cards last minute to fill some holes.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>cU14 Hidden Information</strong> – New Mechanic, Future Hint (Specific); this is a mechanic we are planning to include in "Peanut" block.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This was a card that, when revealed by any other card, let you spend 1U to draw a card. <em>Lorwyn</em> did mess around with revealing as a cost but didn't do much with revealing triggers. This is definitely playing in a loosey-goosey rules area.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>cU15 Exchange Flight</strong> – Red Herring; this mechanic probably won't work as a fleshed-out mechanic. If it somehow worked out rules-wise, and people liked it, obviously we'd revisit it.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This is <a class="autocard-link" data-image-url="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Arcanum+Wings" href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcanum+Wings">Arcanum Wings</a>. We haven't revisited the Aura-swap mechanic. It's dangerous in that it lets you circumvent mana costs.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>cU16 Belittle</strong> – Future Hint (Vague); "Peanut" is playing around with revealing as a cost, but this card is probably the kind of card we'd see when we revisit the mechanic.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;"><em>Lorwyn</em> did mess around with revealing as a cost, but we haven't done much else with it.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>uU11 Bad Mojo</strong> – Evolution, Red Herring; I don't see a future for evil scry.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This card became <a class="autocard-link" data-image-url="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Spin+into+Myth" href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spin+into+Myth">Spin into Myth</a>. We have not reused fateseal as a keyword. It's just kind of mean.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>uU12 Speedy Looter</strong> – Future Hint (Vague); we're planning to start using haste on white and blue utility creatures.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This was us exploring the idea of putting haste on blue creatures (usually with 0 power) where the haste was about using the activated ability right away rather than attacking. This isn't something we've explored since.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>uU13 Twiddlywinker</strong> – Evolution; this is a tweak on the scry mechanic, which gets reintroduced in the set.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This is <a class="autocard-link" data-image-url="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Cryptic+Annelid" href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Annelid">Cryptic Annelid</a>. Scry is a mechanic that we've explored a lot, so much so, that we made it evergreen.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>uU14 Imaginarion</strong> – Future Hint (Vague); this is the goofy one that we'll reprint one day (unless it proves horribly broken).</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This was a 1UU 2/1 artifact creature with a mana value of 0. It didn't make it to print.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>uU15 Butterfly</strong> – Future Hint (Vague); one day we'll bring back morph during a multicolor year.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This was a blue creature with a white morph cost. We did mess around with using morph in a multicolor set in <em>Khans of Tarkir</em>, but we've never messed in this space. This card didn't make it to print.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>rU11 Gimp Flipper</strong> – Evolution, Red Herring; I don't plan on revisiting flip cards again.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This card didn't make it to print. It was a flip creature (like in <em>Champions of Kamigawa</em>). The card had vanishing and kept flipping back and forth from Human to Wolf. Weirdly kind of hints at <em>Innistrad</em>.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>rU12 Veiled Clone</strong> – Future Hint (Vague); if the rules don't kill this card, I assume we'll see it again.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This was an enchantment that becomes a copy of the next permanent that enters the battlefield. It didn't make it to print, and I'm not sure why it's futureshifted.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>rU13 Jhoira, Wizened Matriarch</strong> – Things from the Future; just here to contrast with her non-bonus present-day card.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This was a version of Jhoira as an old lady. She had vanishing 7 and could tap to tutor for an instant with the mana value equal to the number of counters on her. The card never made it to print, but we did do a cycle of legendary futureshifted creatures with grandeur. Interestingly, Jhoira stopped aging, so the idea of old Jhoira is quirky.</p>
</div>

<h2>Black</h2>

<p><strong>cB11 Cockroaches Unending</strong> – New Keyword, Future Hint (Vague); endless is a keyword we might use one day, nothing planned in the immediate future.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Endless was a keyword that made the creature return to your hand whenever it went to the graveyard from the battlefield. It never made it to print.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>cB12 Mean Imp</strong> – Evolution, Future Hint (Vague); this card is playing around with non-mana echo costs; we will definitely explore this when we do echo next.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This card is <a class="autocard-link" data-image-url="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Deepcavern+Imp" href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deepcavern+Imp">Deepcavern Imp</a>. I guess technically it's not yet a lie that the next time we do echo we'll do non-mana costs. Man, I love using the word "definitely."</p>
</div>

<p><strong>cB13 Scaredy Linx</strong> – New Keyword (kind of), Future Hint (Specific); if we keyword <a class="autocard-link" data-image-url="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Spirit+Link" href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spirit+Link">Spirit Link</a> here, we need to follow up with it in "Peanut"; essentially, we'd be making the switch here, but it would only be on one card, whereas in "Peanut," it would be on multiple cards.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Originally, lifelink was going to be introduced on this black creature. It ended up getting moved to white's <a class="autocard-link" data-image-url="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Mistmeadow+Skulk" href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistmeadow+Skulk">Mistmeadow Skulk</a>.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>cB14 Sluggish Zombie</strong> – New Keyword, Future Hint (Vague); this keyword might prove valuable for development (as it allows a mechanic that is good against noncreature decks and worse against creature decks).</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Sluggish Zombie is the introduction of last strike. Designer Mark Gottlieb created this card, then rules manager Mark Gottlieb said black border couldn't do it. This card did see the light of day as <a class="autocard-link" data-image-url="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Extremely+Slow+Zombie" href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Extremely+Slow+Zombie">Extremely Slow Zombie</a> in <em>Unstable</em>.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>cB15 Dark Surrender</strong> – New Keyword, Future Hint (Specific); I'm saving this mechanic for a gothic horror world that's planned five or six years out.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This card became <a class="autocard-link" data-image-url="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Death+Rattle" href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+Rattle">Death Rattle</a> and had a mechanic called gravecast that would get renamed to delve. That gothic horror world would be <em>Innistrad</em>, and we did look into using delve there, but decided against it. Delve worked better in a set where just one portion cared about the graveyard, so it found a home in the Sultai clan in <em>Khans of Tarkir</em>.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>uB11 Flesh Eater</strong> – New Mechanic, Keyword Extension, Red Herring; I don't think this mechanic would work out in large numbers.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This card would become <a class="autocard-link" data-image-url="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Fleshwrither" href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleshwrither">Fleshwrither</a>. I was correct that we weren't going to make use of transfigure. Tutor mechanics have just gone out of vogue because they create too much repetition in gameplay.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>uB12 Forgetful Necromancer</strong> – Miscellaneous, Future Hint (Vague); we'll bring this guy back in an environment that we feel needs him (or more likely the set after).</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This card would become Yixilid Jailer. It's yet to be brought back to a premier set.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>uB13 Poisoned Fangs</strong> – New Keyword, Future Hint (Specific); poison will be coming back in "Lights," "Camera," and "Action" (my codenames for the sets after "Live," "Long," and "Prosper") where we return to Phyrexia. Venom is a keyword we plan on using.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This card became Snake Cult Initiate. Its ability, called venom, would be renamed as poisonous. Poison did come back in "Lights," "Camera," and "Action" (aka <em>Scars of Mirrodin</em> block), but poisonous would be replaced with infect.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>uB14 Wound Infection</strong> – Red Herring; we do not plan to have enchantments tap as we need to keep a separation between enchantments and artifacts.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This was an enchantment with a tap ability. This would get moved to red and become <a class="autocard-link" data-image-url="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Flowstone+Embrace" href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flowstone+Embrace">Flowstone Embrace</a>. We had no plans, and continue to have no plans, to put tapping onto enchantments. It's one of the few differences still existing between artifacts and enchantments.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>uB15 Dauthi Rogue</strong> – Future Hint (Vague); both pieces will see play in the future, but I don't know when or if they'll line up in the same block.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This creature had shadow and a required discarding cost as the card entered the battlefield. This card never saw print.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>rB11 Dredge Sliver</strong> – Miscellaneous; this card was just us extending the Sliver theme. If dredge and Slivers ever return at the same time, maybe we'd reprint this.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This was a Sliver that granted dredge 3. In development, it was decided to have the futureshifted cycle of Slivers all grant brand-new abilities.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>rB12 Tomb Stalker</strong> – New Mechanic, Future Hint (Specific); this mechanic is from the gothic horror block.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Surprise, surprise—this card was printed as <a class="autocard-link" data-image-url="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Tombstalker" href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tombstalker">Tombstalker</a>.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>rB13 Mind Churn</strong> – Keyword Extension, Future Hint (Vague); I have no immediate plans for this mechanic, but if the players like it, I see no reason it can't come back (okay, other than power issues).</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This would become <a class="autocard-link" data-image-url="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Bitter+Ordeal" href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitter+Ordeal">Bitter Ordeal</a> and introduce gravestorm. We've yet to reuse that ability. And yes, we're wary of storm variants.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>rB14 Rotting Carcass</strong> – Future Hint (Vague); the game seems to be moving toward more triggers that happen as things change zones.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This card never saw print. This was a Zombie that made the opponent lose life every time it changed zones.</p>
</div>

<h2>Red</h2>

<p><strong>cR11 Sneaky Goblin</strong> – Evolution, Future Hint (Vague); as we like cycling, I know we'll go down paths like this in the future.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This was a 1RR 2/2 mountainwalking Goblin with cycling 0. It dealt 2 damage to you when cycled. It never saw print. We have experimented with cycling costs, but never 0.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>cR12 Wide Receiver Kavu</strong> – New Keyword, Future Hint (Vague); I'm not sure when, but frenzy will be used in a future set, probably in the next five years.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This creature had frenzy. The ability was moved to the black Sliver. I really had high hopes for frenzy, but play design is not a fan, so every time I've tried to put it into a set, I've been advised to remove it.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>CR13 Spear Tosser</strong> – Future Hint (Specific); we're going to be playing around with creatures that affect things sharing a creature type in "Peanut" block, most likely starting in "Butter."</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">We figured out we were going to do Tribal as a card type in <em>Lorwyn</em>, so we made use of it here. It ended up getting moved to the white card <a class="autocard-link" data-image-url="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Bound+in+Silence" href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bound+in+Silence">Bound in Silence</a> and referenced in the reminder text on <a class="autocard-link" data-image-url="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Tarmogoyf" href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf">Tarmogoyf</a>.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>cR14 Viashino Seether</strong> – Red Herring; I don't plan to make use of negative power in the future.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This is <a class="autocard-link" data-image-url="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Char-Rumbler" href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Char-Rumbler">Char-Rumbler</a>. I was correct that we wouldn't use negative power much in the future.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>cR15 Land Trap</strong> – Future Hint (Vague); this card is barely timeshifted material and can easily come back.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This is us experimenting with other ways of doing land destruction without it actually destroying the land. We did try some land freezing (it doesn't untap), but it didn't stick.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>cR16 Hurry Up</strong> – Evolution, Future Hint (Vague); we'll be exploring this vein of design space when next we bring back flashback.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This card was a sorcery that granted haste for R with flashback 0. It didn't see print and we haven't done any flashback 0 cards.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>uR11 Replay Goblin</strong> – New Keyword, Red Herring; the design space for this mechanic is much tighter than it might appear.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This card was a 1/1 Goblin with an "enters the battlefield" effect (it made 1/1 red Goblin creature tokens). It had the ability replay which allowed you to cast it from the battlefield as well as from your hand. It didn't make it to print, I think because it made the rules manager's eye twitch too much.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>uR12 Arrogant War Trainer</strong> – Future Hint (Specific); "Peanut" will be playing around with "classes matter," but we must decide if we're willing to create a new class for flavor purposes.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This card didn't make it. It was just us hinting at a new possible class. Kind of boring.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>uR13 Goblin Swarm</strong> – Evolution, Future Hint (Vague); I know echo will come back, and non-mana echo costs will be something we explore.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This card was messing around with non-mana echo costs. It got cut. I was a little too confident about echo returning.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>uR14 Timebreather</strong> – Miscellaneous; this card is here to play up the time counter theme of the block.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This card got moved to the non-timeshifted portion of the set and became <a class="autocard-link" data-image-url="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Rift+Elemental" href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rift+Elemental">Rift Elemental</a>.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>uR15 Triplestrike</strong> – New keyword, Keyword Extension, Future Hint (Vague); if last strike works out, I guarantee triple strike will return.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Like last strike, this card got killed by the rules manager and came out as an <em>Un-</em> card in <em>Unstable</em> (<a class="autocard-link" data-image-url="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Three-Headed+Goblin" href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Three-Headed+Goblin">Three-Headed Goblin</a>).</p>
</div>

<p><strong>rR11 Brainstorm Elemental</strong> – Evolution, Future Hint (Vague); more exploration of non-mana echo costs.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This card became <a class="autocard-link" data-image-url="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Shah+of+Naar+Isle" href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shah+of+Naar+Isle">Shah of Naar Isle</a> with an echo cost of 0. Echo has yet to return, so there has been no further experimentation with it.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>rR12 Goblin Splorg</strong> – Cards from the Future, Future Hint (Vague); we will one day make "Splorgs."</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This was the slot that would eventually become <a class="autocard-link" data-image-url="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Steamflogger+Boss" href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steamflogger+Boss">Steamflogger Boss</a>. It started as a card that referenced a creature type that did not yet exist. Aaron wanted it to push further into the unknown, and eventually, it erected monuments, and then, finally, assembled contraptions (with Riggers). Contraptions was one of the major mechanics of <em>Unstable</em>. You can see why I joked that <em>Future Sight</em> was, at the time, the third <em>Un-</em> set.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>rR13 Traveler from Beyond</strong> – Red Herring; I do not want to make the "removed from game zone" a revolving door.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This was a card that got things back from exile (then "removed from the game"). I came to my senses and had the card pulled from development.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>rR14 Gimme, Gimme</strong> – Red Herring; this is a card touching on stuff we're probably not going to bother with again.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This card did not make it to print. It was playing around with stealing phases. <a class="autocard-link" data-image-url="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Clocknapper" href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clocknapper">Clocknapper</a> in <em>Unstable </em>would revisit this.</p>
</div>

<h2>Green</h2>

<p><strong>cG11 Card-Loving Thallid</strong> – Miscellaneous; this is here to expand upon the block's Thallid theme.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This card was experimenting with Thallids that got counters based on a trigger other than the start of the turn. This card triggered when you drew a card. It still made a 1/1 Saproling for removing three spore counters. This card didn't make it to print.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>cG12 Spellwild Dog</strong> – Future Hint (Vague); this card (and cards like it) are fair game for any upcoming set.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This was a 2/2 Dog for 1G that made spells that target it cost 2 less mana. It didn't make it to print.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>cG13 Creature Loving Thallid</strong> – Miscellaneous; this is here to expand upon the block's Thallid theme.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This was a Thallid that triggered off non-Funguses entering the battlefield. This card also did not make it to print.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>cG14 Runeweb Spider</strong> – New Keyword (kind of), Future Hint (Specific); like <a class="autocard-link" data-image-url="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Spirit+Link" href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spirit+Link">Spirit Link</a>, choosing to keyword "can block fliers" means we need to probably change it in "Peanut."</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This card became <a class="autocard-link" data-image-url="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Thornweald+Archer" href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thornweald+Archer">Thornweald Archer</a> and introduced reach.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>cG15 Elf-walla</strong> – Future Hint (Specific); "Peanut" is playing around with revealing as a cost.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This was a <a class="autocard-link" data-image-url="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Rootwalla" href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rootwalla">Rootwalla</a> variant that required you to reveal an elf as part of a cheaper activation cost. This card didn't make it to print.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>cG16 Whittling Bloom</strong> – New Keyword, Red Herring; this keyword is not exciting on all that many cards.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This card had the whittle mechanic that let you exile other copies of this card from your library when you cast it. The mechanic didn't play great and was cut. You can see green had a higher miss ratio than the other colors.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>uG11 Poison Sliver</strong> – New Keyword, Future Hint (Vague); poison is coming back in "Lights," "Camera," and "Action," so I doubt it will also have Slivers.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This card would become <a class="autocard-link" data-image-url="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Virulent+Sliver" href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Virulent+Sliver">Virulent Sliver</a>. I was correct in predicting that <em>Scars of Mirrodin</em> wouldn't have Slivers.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>uG12 Brother Nature</strong> – Future Hint (Vague); if this card works out, it could come back whenever.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This was a 1GG 0/5 Elemental that tapped for G that was a forest while in your library, allowing you to grab it with things like land-fetching spells. It didn't make it to print.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>uG13 Breath of Air</strong> – Future Hint (Specific); "Jelly" is playing around with using mana symbols as a costing mechanism.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This card became <a class="autocard-link" data-image-url="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Phosphorescent+Feast" href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phosphorescent+Feast">Phosphorescent Feast</a> and introduced chroma, although it wasn't named. I was correct in that it would show up in <em>Shadowmoor</em> block a year later. Chroma didn't go over great but got redesigned as devotion in original <em>Theros</em> to much greater fanfare.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>uG14 Have Enough Land?</strong> – Evolution, Future Hint (Vague); this card can come back when we next explore cycling.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This card became <a class="autocard-link" data-image-url="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Edge+of+Autumn" href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Edge+of+Autumn">Edge of Autumn</a>. We haven't really messed with too many non-mana cycling costs since then.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>uG15 Elf Biologist</strong> – Future Hint (Vague); this card can come back in an environment that can make use of it.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This was a 3/3 Elf for 3G that made creatures the turn after this creature entered the battlefield cheaper to cast. It didn't make it to print.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>rG11 Thallid Sliver</strong> – Miscellaneous; this is here to cross the block's Sliver and Thallid themes.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This turned all Slivers into Thallids, getting a spore counter every turn and then being able to turn three spore counters into a 1/1 Saproling. All the Slivers were changed to have new keywords, so this went away.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>rG12 Boss Scragnoth</strong> – Future Hint (Vague); it's more likely that pieces of this card come back than this card in its entirety.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This was a 5G 4/4 Beast that could not be countered, discarded, sacrificed, or the target of spells. It didn't make it to print.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>rG13 Lint Elemental</strong> – Future Hint (Vague); this card can easily come back if people like it.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This card became <a class="autocard-link" data-image-url="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Force+of+Savagery" href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Savagery">Force of Savagery</a>, the 8/0 creature. We haven't explored many more 0 toughness creatures.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>rG14 Type Lhurgoyf</strong> – Future Hint (Vague); we will probably explore the design space of caring about card types in the future.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This card became <a class="autocard-link" data-image-url="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Tarmogoyf" href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf">Tarmogoyf</a>. We knew both Tribal and planeswalkers were coming out soon (both ended up premiering in <em>Lorwyn</em>).</p>
</div>

<p><strong>rG15 Love of Vanilla</strong> – Red Herring; probably an area we don't want to delve too much into.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This card became <a class="autocard-link" data-image-url="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Muraganda+Petroglyphs" href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Muraganda+Petroglyphs">Muraganda Petroglyphs</a>. We've done a few "vanilla matters" cards, but it's a difficult theme to do in volume.</p>
</div>

<h2>Multicolor</h2>

<p><strong>rZ11 Puma Warrior</strong> – Future Hint (Specific); "Sandwich" will be exploring advanced hybrid costs.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This was a 4/1 Cat Soldier with a mana cost of (r/b)(r/b)(g/w)(g/w) that had abilities that worked with any combination of colors paid. <em>Shadowmoor</em> block would experiment with hybrid mana costs, but this card didn't see print.</p>
</div>

<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>

<p><strong>RX01 Venser</strong> – New Card Type, Future Hint (Specific); it looks as if "Rock" is going to introduce planeswalkers.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This was actually the precursor to <a class="autocard-link" data-image-url="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Jace+Beleren" href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren">Jace Beleren</a>, who premiered in <em>Lorwyn</em>. At the time of the handoff, we expected that the planeswalker card type was going to premiere in <em>Future Sight</em>, but we eventually realized we needed more time to work on them and pushed them back. We hinted at their upcoming existence on <a class="autocard-link" data-image-url="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Tarmogoyf" href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf">Tarmogoyf</a>.</p>
</div>

<h2>Artifacts</h2>

<p><strong>uA11 Luna Ring</strong> – Miscellaneous; this card is more to play into "Pop's" themes than anything else.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This was a mana rock that gave you two colorless mana on your next turn. We didn't end up making it.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>uA12 Thunderdome</strong> – New Subtype, Future Hint (Specific); "Live," "Long," and "Prosper" as the land block will probably want to explore Equipment for land.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This card became <a class="autocard-link" data-image-url="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Darksteel+Garrison" href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Garrison">Darksteel Garrison</a> and introduced Fortifications. We looked at them for <em>Zendikar</em> but didn't end up using them there. It turns out there just aren't a lot of effects you want to equip to a land.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>rA11 Morphin' Miller</strong> – Evolution, Future Hint (Vague); when morph returns next, we'll probably explore noncreature morph.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This became <a class="autocard-link" data-image-url="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Whetwheel" href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whetwheel">Whetwheel</a>. As I said above, <em>Khans of Tarkir</em> block did explore noncreature morph (and one could argue manifest did it a little) but passed.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>rA12 Akroma's Monument</strong> – Cards from the Future; this card is the third piece of our Akroma cycle that runs through the block.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This became <a class="autocard-link" data-image-url="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Akroma%27s+Memorial" href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroma%27s+Memorial">Akroma's Memorial</a> and moved to non-futureshifted.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>rA13 Amulet of Chaos</strong> – Future Hint (Vague); during a future artifact block (and note that "Lights," "Camera," and "Action" are in one such block), we'll explore alternate-color mana costs.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This was an artifact that could be cast for 6 or UUU (kind of a precursor to hybrid mana) and let you exchange three of your permanents for three permanents that shared a card type. This card didn't make it to print.</p>
</div>

<p>And that in a mere eight pages is the "Pop" design philosophy in a nutshell. Let me know if you have any more specific questions.</p>

<p>Mark Rosewater</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">As you can see, we had some idea where the future was heading and made a lot of hints toward those things. We also made some more open-ended guesses as to where the game could go even though we hadn't yet planned on going there. Looking back with fifteen years of hindsight, this set did a pretty good job of giving players a glimpse at <em>Magic</em>'s future.</p>

<h1>FAIRY TALES</h1>

<p>The fairy-tale portion is the heart of the design. Fairy-tale tropes are so infused into our society (the average American, for instance, sees the Cinderella story in at least ten different versions during their lifetime) that it allows us to do something we haven't been able to do since <em>Innistrad</em>: create strong and instantly recognizable cards built on genre awareness.</p>

<p>The fairy-tale portion of the set is defined less by structure and more by modularity. It's defined by top-down design and hitting upon story archetypes. The goal of the design of the fairy-tale section is to make sure that each piece is as flavorful as possible while mechanically linking to the pieces that associate with it. We want players to be able to see the stories they know happen on cards. For instance, you can trade the cow for magic beans, or you can wake the sleeping princess with true love's kiss.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">The important point in a Vision Design handoff is stressing the philosophy that guides the decisions. Set Design is mostly going to make their own cards, but I want them doing so embracing the vision of the design. This is why I spend a lot of time stating, and restating, how the set needs to be put together.</p>
</div>

<p>We worked hard to make sure that the relevant pieces click together as players would want them to, but we also made sure that those pieces were open-ended enough to allow the "Mad Libs" mix-and-match feel we were going for. The key to doing this was to have some flavorful themes woven through the set that pieces can click into. (A few of the themes that weave through both fairy tales and Camelot, such as the build-up theme, were listed in the Camelot section).</p>

<h2>Enchantment Theme</h2>

<p>As we explored all the fairy-tale themes, one of the things we noticed was that fairy tales tended to have threats that had answers. Sure, you could put someone into a deep sleep, but true love could wake them up. You could lock someone in a tower or turn them into a frog, but it was undoable. They could be rescued, or the spell could be broken. We liked the idea that most of the threats had answers. It made the world feel a little less cruel (see below for the difference between "Archery" and "Baseball"). To accomplish this, more of the set's threats are done through Auras.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">For various reasons, including the removal of quests, the enchantment theme got pulled down a bit in set design. Interestingly, the theme became part of a subtheme of "artifacts and enchantments matter" in white and blue, something we'd experimented with in Vision Design with "mystical" (a word that bundled artifacts, enchantments, and Faeries). As always, there's overlap across vision design and set design so that the Set Design team is aware of things Vision Design did. In this case, the first Set Design lead, Mark Gottlieb, was a member of the Vision Design team.</p>
</div>

<p>Fairy tales also have a lot of magic in them, so we also wanted a bunch of magical effects represented through enchantments. The two things combined make enchantments play a larger role than normal in the set—mostly through an emphasis on Auras, but there will be some global enchantments, like the Quests, that are relevant.</p>

<p>We have focused the pro-enchantment themes in blue and black. While all the colors have more Auras than normal, white, blue, and black, due to the nature of their effects, have the most.</p>

<h2>Artifact Theme</h2>

<p>R&amp;D is making a conscious shift to move toward more colored artifacts to allow us to use artifact themes without causing tournament issues. "Archery" is going to be a transition set using choice costs to make artifacts that are colored yet castable with colorless mana.</p>

<p>The reason this is a good fit for the set is that fairy tales, and to a lesser extent Camelot, are overrun with objects, often magical. By mixing them with the choice costs, we can help the monocolor theme in two ways. The colored artifacts can be prioritized in the right color but can be picked up and used off-color if necessary. We have also created a slightly higher percentage of artifact creatures to help in this area.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">One of the reasons that the choice costs for artifacts weren't done was a belief that they were only getting drafted by people playing that color. As I explained above, I thought it was more the lack of visual tools helping drafters in playtesting realize that they could play the cards off-color. Nonetheless, when the choice costs went away, the decision was made to just make some artifacts colored. Again, this got woven into the white and blue "artifact and enchantments matter" subtheme.</p>
</div>

<p>I know there's some concern that people aren't using the off-color artifact costs enough in Draft, but I believe it's partially a frame issue more than anything else that drafters aren't always looking to see if they can draft an artifact if it's in another color's frame. I believe colored artifact frames will help. Also, using choice costs in artifacts helps stretch the theme across different sections to make the set feel more cohesive.</p>

<p>The pro-artifact colors are blue and red. Much like the enchantment theme, all the colors have colored artifacts, but the colors that care are focused down to two. This allows many variants of an artifacts-matter deck.</p>

<h2>Non-Human Tribal</h2>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This theme stuck around through set design and even stayed in the colors Vision Design had put it into.</p>
</div>

<p>Due to the nature of the needs for both Camelot and fairy tales, this set is going to have a higher concentration of Humans than most sets. We realized we can make use of this to create a markable subtype to capture magical creatures and animals: non-Human tribal. We don't often do negative tribal because it hits too many of the creatures, but the higher concentration of Humans makes it work in this set. We feel it adds flavor while making a tribal element that feels new. Note that many Humans are Knights and will get to be included in the Knight tribal theme talked about above.</p>

<p>The non-Human tribal cards appear in red and green. Again, every color will have non-Human creatures, allowing flexibility for how decks are built.</p>

<h2>Fairy-Tale Tropes</h2>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">One of the things we worked on during Vision Design was trying to figure out where the line was supposed to be (aka what did and didn't make sense in this world). While the topic lingered on into set design, mostly the lines I spell out here are where we ended up. Bake into a Pie, by the way, is both a fairy tale and a nursery rhyme reference, so we left it in.</p>
</div>

<p>This is the bread and butter of "Archery," and it's the component we believe will be the set's hallmark. While we're doing a cool take on Knights and medieval life, that's something <em>Magic</em> has hit many times. Fairy tales, classical continental European ones, are something we've barely touched upon.</p>

<p>Working with the Creative team, we did come up with some guidelines for what we didn't want in the set.</p>

<ol>
	<li>No talking animals. The set wants animals as they show up a lot in fairy tales, but they shouldn't take on human qualities like dressing up or talking. They are allowed to have agency (the duck brings you a key). We do reference things like the three bears and the three pigs, but more as normal animals.</li>
	<li>No nursery rhymes.</li>
	<li>No fables.</li>
	<li>No specific references to stories not in the public domain.</li>
</ol>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Because these tropes are better known, I'm going to be talking a little more about this list than I did about the Camelot-inspired list.</p>
</div>

<p>Below is every card referencing a fairy-tale trope or story spelled out.</p>

<p>Note #1: All of the following cards are named to reference their source material. The Creative team will do shifting with gender and other aspects to create a modern-feeling set. We named the cards directly after the tropes and stories so more people recognized what we were referencing.</p>

<p>Note #2: There are more Faeries in the file than faerie tropes. I listed them all, but some of the more generic Faeries could turn into something else if need be.</p>

<p>Note #3: A few things ended up getting hit more than once. The Set Design team can pick their favorite.</p>

<p><strong>CW02 White Clover Faerie</strong> – A helpful Faerie.</p>

<p><strong>CW04 Animated Harp</strong> – This is one of the items Jack steals from the giant.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Animated Harp was one of the items I was sad to lose, as it just seems like something a <em>Magic </em>set would have on this Plane. I'll have to make it when we go back. (This isn't me announcing anything, just me being my optimistic self.) For those unaware, this was one of the items that Jack stole from the giant. The Golden Goose did make it in.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>CW05 Friendly Faerie</strong> – This is a Faerie obsessed with magic.</p>

<p><strong>CW10 Beautiful Princess</strong> – This is playing into the trope of the princess that gets along with most everyone, including all the animals.</p>

<p><strong>CW10 True Love's Kiss</strong> – The go-to fairy-tale solution.</p>

<p><strong>CW11 Big Wing Faerie</strong> – A larger Faerie.</p>

<p><strong>CW14 Midsummer Ball</strong> – Dances are a common fairy-tale trope, the most famous being in Cinderella.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">We managed to get the midnight clock in, but no actual reference to a ball.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>CW17 Locked in the Tall Tower</strong> – Reference to Rapunzel.</p>

<p><strong>UW01 Tin Soldier</strong> – A fairy tale by Hans Christian Anderson. He falls in love with a paper ballerina (see in blue below).</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">We did design a few deeper cuts for fairy tales, but we had so much to work with, they just didn't make it through.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>UW04 Wishing Well</strong> – Where the princess wishes to meet the man of her dreams.</p>

<p><strong>UW05 Charming Prince</strong> – Prince Charming</p>

<p><strong>UW08 Faerie Enchantress</strong> – A Faerie who charms or hexes others. Seen in stories like "Sleeping Beauty."</p>

<p><strong>UW11 Bake into a Pie</strong> – A ghastly fairy-tale punishment.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Bake into a Pie was turned over to Set Design in its white, Arrest-like version.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>UW12 Glass Coffin</strong> – What Snow White was put into after everyone thought she was dead from eating the poisoned apple. The glass coffin originally comes from its own fairy tale, but Disney's use of it makes people think of it as a Snow White thing.</p>

<p><strong>RW05 Happily Ever After</strong> – How happy fairy tales end.</p>

<p><strong>RW07 Star-Crossed Lovers</strong> – There are a bunch of fairy tales about young lovers who fall in love but come from factions where they aren't supposed to be together. <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> became the most famous version, but the story's roots are in fairy tales.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">While it's true that this trope originated in fairy tales, it's not what the audience associates the theme with, so we took it out. Thanks, Shakespeare.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>RW08 Pinocchio</strong> – We have two different takes on the small wooden boy.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">The Set Design team ultimately made their own version and used neither of ours.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>CU01 Paper Ballerina</strong> – The love of the Tin Soldier</p>

<p><strong>CU03 Love-Struck Mermaid</strong> – The young mermaid who dealt with the sea witch to become human to pursue the man she loved.</p>

<p><strong>CU04 Curious Puppet</strong> – A second take on Pinocchio.</p>

<p><strong>CU07 Very Slow Tortoise</strong> – A nod to "The Tortoise and the Hare." Possibly off limits as it's a fable, not a fairy tale.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">"The Tortoise and the Hare" was off limits as a fable, so the card was removed.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>CU09 Faerie Artificer</strong> – A Faerie with a fascination for mechanical objects. Tinkerbell, for example, falls into this trope.</p>

<p><strong>CU10 Form of the Frog</strong> – A creature is turned into a frog like the Frog Prince.</p>

<p><strong>CU11 Shrinking Hex</strong> – A hex that shrinks the creature to a tiny size.</p>

<p><strong>CU14 Emperor's New Clothes</strong> – Illusionary clothes from "The Emperor's New Clothes."</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">There was much talk about whether "The Emperor's New Clothes" was a fairy tale. In the end, we didn't use it.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>CU15 Storybook</strong> – Numerous fairy tales involve a magical storybook.</p>

<p><strong>CU16 Sleeping Spell</strong> – The spell that put Sleeping Beauty to sleep.</p>

<p><strong>UU01 Clever Faerie</strong> – Fairy tales often have Faeries that try to trick people.</p>

<p><strong>UU02 Mystical Faerie</strong> – A Faerie obsessed with magic.</p>

<p><strong>UU06 Notorious Thief</strong> – Several fairy tales have a main character who is a thief. Aladdin is the Middle Eastern version of this type of tale.</p>

<p><strong>UU07 Faerie Godmother</strong> – The Faerie who helps Cinderella with her temporary magic.</p>

<p><strong>RU01 Wish-Granting Faerie</strong> – Tying Faeries to <em>Magic</em>'s wish mechanic.</p>

<p><strong>RU02 Blue Faerie</strong> – The Faerie that brought Pinocchio to life.</p>

<p><strong>RU03 Goldilocks</strong> – The visitor of the three bears with very exacting likes and dislikes.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Goldilocks started in blue and played up her curiosity. Her furniture-breaking version was going to be in "Baseball," which was originally planned as the second set in this block. (What? Keep reading. I explain below.)</p>
</div>

<p><strong>RU04 Spellthief Faerie</strong> – A Faerie that steals magic.</p>

<p><strong>RU05 Trickster Faerie</strong> – A Faerie that messes around with others.</p>

<p><strong>RU08 Giant Whale</strong> – The whale that swallowed Pinocchio.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">The Vision Design handoff had a little more from Pinocchio in it.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>RU09 Magic Mirror</strong> – The mirror the Evil Queen uses to find out who is the fairest in the land. (It's not her.)</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">We didn't do a lot of Camelot/fairy-tale crossovers, but we swapped in the magic mirror for scrying pools seen in Arthurian lore. We felt if the blue court was using magic to see things, we might as well tap into a fairy-tale classic.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>RU10 Magic Disguise</strong> – The Evil Queen uses this magic to look like an elderly lady selling apples.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This card was identical to Metamorphic Alteration in <em>Core Set 2019</em>, but they made it first, so we had to lose it here.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>RU11 Illusionary Control</strong> – Mind control shows up in a number of fairy tales.</p>

<p><strong>RU12 Swap</strong> – Another trope is two people swapping roles. <em>The Prince and the Pauper</em> is probably the most famous example.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">We didn't do as much in the way of general tropes in the fairy-tale side as we did on the Camelot side of the set.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>CB01 Witch's Cat</strong> – Witches are a big part of fairy tales, and the black cat is a trope associated with witches.</p>

<p><strong>CB02 Omen Witch</strong> – The trope of the witch that sees the future, usually of bad things to happen.</p>

<p><strong>CB03 Field Watcher</strong> – Farming plays a role in many fairy tales, so scarecrows show up occasionally, usually in a scary role.</p>

<p><strong>CB04 Blackthorn Faerie</strong> – As in the story of Sleeping Beauty, there are good Faeries and evil Faeries.</p>

<p><strong>CB07 Widow</strong> – Death of a parent is very common in fairy tales.</p>

<p><strong>CB12 Blinded by Birds</strong> – A fairy-tale punishment, usually of bad people.</p>

<p><strong>CB13 Spoil Hex</strong> – Magic that addresses a problem but at a high personal cost.</p>

<p><strong>CB14 Tainted Blessing</strong> – Supposed positive magic that comes at a cost to the affected.</p>

<p><strong>CB16 Potion of Forgetfulness</strong> – Potions are popular in fairy tales. Removing memories is a popular magical effect.</p>

<p><strong>CB17 Poisoned Apple</strong> – The Evil Queen tricks Snow White into eating a poisoned apple, supposedly killing her.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">We ended up making an "evil queen in disguise" card that captured the poison apple trope, but in design, we had the poison apple being its own card.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>UB01 Bluebeard</strong> – A fairy tale about a wealthy violent man who has a habit of killing his wives.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Bluebeard is another fairy tale we decided to skip.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>UB02 Hex Casting Witch</strong> – The evil witch that curses Sleeping Beauty to death from a spinning wheel on her sixteenth birthday is a good example of this trope.</p>

<p><strong>UB06 Bridge Troll</strong> – The troll from "The Billy Goats Gruff" that won't let the goats cross the bridge.</p>

<p><strong>UB07 Fated for Death</strong> – Sleeping Beauty's curse.</p>

<p><strong>UB08 Scary Witch</strong> – A more stereotypical scary-looking witch.</p>

<p><strong>RB03 Pied Piper</strong> – The tale of the musician who drives the rats out of town.</p>

<p><strong>RB06 Witch's Cauldron</strong> – Another witch trope.</p>

<p><strong>RB07 Dark Curiosity</strong> – Curiosity is a common thing that gets fairy-tale characters into trouble.</p>

<p><strong>RB09 Stroke of Midnight</strong> – The thing that marks the end of the Faerie Godmother's magic in Cinderella.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Stroke of Midnight was originally a spell representing the moment of the clock striking midnight. Set Design would instead make the clock itself.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>RB10 Forbidden Room</strong> – Beauty is told to avoid going into a certain room by the Beast in "Beauty and the Beast."</p>

<p><strong>RB12 Barter with Death</strong> – There are numerous fairy tales where characters barter with death or a character that could kill them.</p>

<p><strong>CR01 Trading Cow</strong> – Jack trades a cow for magic beans in "Jack and the Beanstalk."</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Oh, Trading Cow. One of the individual designs I was saddest to see change.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>CR02 Gingerbread Golem</strong> – A nod to the Gingerbread Man who no one can catch.</p>

<p><strong>CR04 Tik Tok</strong> – A mechanical creature that's roughly human shaped. The best-known version of this trope is Tik Tok from <em>The Wizard of Oz</em>.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Tik Tok is a bit of a deeper cut that made it into the set, although it got turned into a gnome.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>CR05 Dwarven Miner</strong> – The seven dwarves from the story of Snow White.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">We forgot there already was a Dwarven Miner. (And with such great flavor text—how could I forget?)</p>
</div>

<p><strong>CR07 Scary Scarecrow</strong> – Another scarecrow</p>

<p><strong>CR09 Tall Giant</strong> – There are lots of giants in fairy tales, the most famous is probably the one from "Jack and the Beanstalk."</p>

<p><strong>CR15 Tempt with Power</strong> – Another temptation often seen in faerie tales.</p>

<p><strong>UR01 First-Born Child</strong> – Something of value that bad characters want, most famous being Rumpelstiltskin.</p>

<p><strong>UR04 Redcap</strong> – An evil creature from fairy tales.</p>

<p><strong>UR06 Self-Playing Lyre</strong> – Self-playing musical instruments are a fairy-tale trope, most famously from "Jack and the Beanstalk."</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">You'll notice there are a few times where we have two designs for the same concept. If we liked them both, we left them in for Set Design to pick their favorite (or neither).</p>
</div>

<p><strong>UR08 Stomping Giant</strong> – Playing up the trope of giants liking to crush people underfoot.</p>

<p><strong>RR00 Deal-Making Imp</strong> – A nod to Rumpelstiltskin.</p>

<p><strong>RR03 Giant Killer</strong> – Nod to "Jack, the Giant-Killer," a follow-up to "Jack and the Beanstalk."</p>

<p><strong>RR11 No More Spinning Wheels</strong> – In "Sleeping Beauty," when the king destroys all the spinning wheels in the castle to try and prevent the curse from coming true.</p>

<p><strong>CG01 Deep-Woods Ranger</strong> – The good guy who saves Little Red Riding Hood.</p>

<p><strong>CG03 Huntsman</strong> – The character assigned by the Evil Queen to kill Snow White; he ultimately can't do it and lets her go.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">I believe Garruk was in the set at this point (although, I don't think we'd made a card yet), but we weren't sure he was going to stay, so we included this trope as a creature as well.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>CG09 Gruff Goat</strong> – A nod to the goats from "The Three Bill Goats Gruff."</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">The goats got rolled into the troll card.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>CG11 Smartest Pig</strong> – A nod to the Three Little Pigs.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">I think we avoided making three Pig creature tokens as we were making three Bear creature tokens. Set Design just made them both.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>CG12 Basket of Food</strong> – A nod to the basket Little Red Riding Hood brings to her grandmother.</p>

<p><strong>CG17 Visit Grandmother</strong> – Another nod to "Little Red Riding Hood."</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Not a lot of "Little Red Riding Hood" references made it. The Big Bad Wolf did, and Rowan and Garruk visually called out to the tale.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>UG01 Curse of the Beast</strong> – A nod to the Beast's transformation from "Beauty and the Beast."</p>

<p><strong>UG02 Golden Goose</strong> – One of the items Jack steals from the Giant in "Jack &amp; the Beanstalk."</p>

<p><strong>UG03 Magic Beans</strong> – Jack trades a cow for magic beans, and they grow to make the beanstalk in "Jack and the Beanstalk." That leads to the Giant chasing Jack.</p>

<p><strong>UG10 Three Bears</strong> – A nod to "Goldilocks and the Three Bears."</p>

<p><strong>UG11 Wake the Sleeping Giant</strong> – Nod to "Jack and the Beanstalk."</p>

<p><strong>RG01 Shoemaker</strong> – Nod to "The Elves and the Shoemaker."</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">The Shoemaker was another design that I was sad to see not make the cut.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>RG05 Big Bad Wolf</strong> – Nod to "Little Red Riding Hood" and "Three Little Pigs," although, more the former as he eats Grandma and then she's alive when they cut him open at the end.</p>

<p><strong>RG06 Stray from the Path</strong> – Nod to "Little Red Riding Hood."</p>

<p><strong>RG07 Drawn by Hunger</strong> – Nod to "Hansel and Gretel."</p>

<p><strong>RG08 Once Upon a Time</strong> – How fairy tales begin.</p>

<p><strong>RG10 Lost in the Woods</strong> – A common fairy-tale trope, the most famous example being "Hansel and Gretel."</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">I think Lost in the Woods was a reprint of the card from <em>Dark Ascension</em>.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>MG01 The Grand Ball</strong> – The fancy dance in "Cinderella."</p>

<p><strong>CZ01 Faerie Trio</strong> – Nod to the three helpful Faeries in "Sleeping Beauty."</p>

<p><strong>CZ02 Surprise Visitor</strong> – Common fairy-tale trope, most famous probably from the beginning of "Beauty and the Beast."</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Surprise Visitor was another one I was sad to see cut.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>CZ04 Wildlands Giant</strong> – There are many giants in fairy tales.</p>

<p><strong>CZ06 Temporarily Gone</strong> – Characters, especially children, that go missing is a fairy-tale trope.</p>

<p><strong>CZ08 Cursed Dancing Shoes</strong> – Nod to "The Dancing Shoes" about cursed shoes that force the wearer to continually dance.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">So many fairy tales, we couldn't get to them all.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>CZ10 Remove Evil</strong> – There are many methods in fairy tales to rid evil magic that has cursed people.</p>

<p><strong>RZ01 Faerie Channeler</strong> – A Faerie queen is a common trope.</p>

<p><strong>RZ02 Hexing Witch</strong> – The witch casting curses on others is all over fairy tales. "The Frog Prince" is a popular one.</p>

<p><strong>CA02 Wind-Up Automaton</strong> – Wind-up mechanical people is another fairy-tale trope.</p>

<p><strong>CA03 Golden Key</strong> – Nod to "The Golden Key," an old Brothers Grimm tale.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">The Golden Key was another deep cut that did not make it.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>CA04 Magic Broom</strong> – Another witch trope.</p>

<p><strong>UA01 Magical Carriage</strong> – Nod to "Cinderella".</p>

<p><strong>UA03 Nail-Filled Barrel</strong> – Nod to original Grimm "Cinderella."</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">The nail-filled barrel was a little too gruesome (and not widely known). The Brothers Grimm version of "Cinderella" was not as nice as the versions most people know today.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>UA09 Spinning Wheel</strong> – Nod to both "Sleeping Beauty" and "Rumpelstiltskin."</p>

<p><strong>RL02 Magical Spring</strong> – Magical waters are a fairy-tale trope.</p>

<p><strong>RL02 Witch's Hut</strong> – Another witch trope.</p>

<p><strong>RL04 Gingerbread House</strong> – Nod to "Hansel and Gretel."</p>

<p><strong>RL05 Woodland Path -</strong> Nod to "Hansel and Gretel."</p>

<h2>Draft Themes</h2>

<p>Here are the ten decks we built in for players to draft:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Mono-White</strong> – This plays into the white court and stresses a go-wide strategy of loyalty.</li>
	<li><strong>Mono-Blue</strong> – This plays into the blue court and stresses a control strategy using knowledge.</li>
	<li><strong>Mono-Black</strong> – This plays into the black court and has a mid-range deck that brings creatures back through persistence.</li>
	<li><strong>Mono-Red</strong> – This plays into the red court and has an aggro deck making use of courage.</li>
	<li><strong>Mono-Green</strong> – This plays into the green court and has a ramping strategy of strength.</li>
	<li><strong>White-Black</strong> – This is an aggressive Knight tribal deck.</li>
	<li><strong>Blue-Black</strong> – This is a slower deck caring about enchantments.</li>
	<li><strong>Blue-Red</strong> – This is a tempo deck caring about artifacts.</li>
	<li><strong>Red-Green</strong> – This is a mid-range deck caring about non-Humans.</li>
	<li><strong>Green-White</strong> – This is a creature-focused deck about growth.</li>
</ul>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Vision Design will normally take a stab at Draft archetypes, but this usually gets reworked extensively by Set Design. The versions that fare the best are faction sets where the mechanical identity of the faction is baked into the set.</p>
</div>

<h2>Difference Between "Archery" and "Baseball"</h2>

<p>If you trace the history of fairy tales, they go through an interesting evolution. Fairy tales originated as morality tales, and the earliest versions were very harsh and graphic. Fairy tales then went through a phase where they were shifted to more of a family thing and became much lighter in tone. Most of the modern, family-friendly ones in pop culture are inspired by this point in time. Fairy tales then went through a deconstructionist phase where they started becoming darker and a bit more adult.</p>

<p>"Archery" is trying to capture the lighter, more optimistic phase of fairy tales where bad things were threatening, but in the end, good prevailed. "Baseball" is a combination of the early Brothers Grimm and later deconstruction era of fairy tales, where things got a little darker. Good didn't always prevail.</p>

<p>This will allow us not only to have a cool tonal shift but also lets us repeat many of the same tropes through a different lens. In "Archery," Goldilocks gets to be Inquisitive Child, while in "Baseball," she can be an Unwanted Interloper.</p>

<p>Exploratory design for "Archery" suggested a temptation theme for the set, but through playtesting, we found that the designs had a darker tone, so we're holding off on the theme until "Baseball."</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">At the time I handed off the vision design, the plan was to have two sets based on Eldraine: one a lighter version in the courts, and one a darker version as Rowan and Will ventured into the woods to rescue their father. We decided very early into set design to collapse this into one set. This decision was made for a number of reasons:</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;">1. While there were a bunch of fairy tales that took place in the woods, it wasn't nearly as deep a list as the ones outside it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;">2. Part of making the modular design work was pulling from as many different stories as we could, and it just made for a better set to have access to all the stories at once.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;">3. It made the set feel more like <em>Lorwyn</em>, as that Plane is defined by its contrast between light and dark. We wanted to have a clean delineation between the two Planes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;">4. Just doing fairy tales at all worried some people, and I wanted us to make sure we hit a homerun with our first visit. I knew if the set was a success, we'd be allowed to go back and make more sets later.</p>

<h2>Summation</h2>

<p>"Archery" is a complex design, and I tried hard to capture its essence in this document, but I doubt 7,000-plus words captures it all. If anyone has any questions, please feel free to talk with me, and I'll be happy to explain how different elements weave together.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading,</p>

<p>—Mark Rosewater</p>

<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">As I explained above, this document was only one means of communicating the vision to the Set Design team. I always seek out questions, as I want to address things I might not have thought off when creating the document.</p>
</div>

<hr />
<p>That's it. That's all 7,000-plus words of the <em>Throne of Eldraine</em> vision design handoff document. I hope you enjoyed reading it. As I said last week, if this is something you'd like to see me do again (or maybe never do again), please <a href="mailto:making.magic@hotmail.com">email me</a> or contact me through social media (<a href="https://twitter.com/maro254" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://markrosewater.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Tumblr</a>, and <a href="http://instagram.com/mtgmaro" target="_blank">Instagram</a>) and let me know.</p>

<p>Join me next week when I talk about facing the scariest thing in design.</p>

<p>Until then, may you enjoy playing <em>Throne of Eldraine</em> as much as I enjoyed making it.</p>

The point of the document is to crystallize the vision of the set and explain where the set is mechanically to allow a smooth transition to the new team. A lot of changes happen between vision design and the set being released, so I thought it would be an interesting and informative look into the process as a whole and the design of <em>Throne of Eldraine </em>in particular (referred to by its code name, "Archery," throughout this document).</p>

<p>Here's how this is going to work: I will show you the actual document and will be jumping in from time to time to explain what's going on or give larger context. There is one paragraph in this document I can't show you and will have to black out, but I will explain why I have to black it out when I do so. Also, this document is over 7,000 words long (not counting all my words talking about it), so I'm going to break it up into two different articles. As the document itself has two parts, that seemed like the best natural breaking point. That said, let's dive right in.</p>

<h1>"Archery" Vision Design Handoff Document</h1>

<p><strong>Vision Design team</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Mark Rosewater (lead)</li>
	<li>Peter Lee</li>
	<li>Ethan Fleischer</li>
	<li>Mark Gottlieb</li>
	<li>Pete Ingram</li>
	<li>Dan Burdick</li>
	<li>Andrew Brown</li>
	<li>Sam Stoddard</li>
	<li>Mickey Cushing</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Creative Liaisons</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Kelly Digges</li>
	<li>Cynthia Sheppard</li>
</ul>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">We always start the document by introducing the Vision Design team as well as the creative liaisons, from the Creative team, who work closely with the Vision Design team. The Vision Design team itself was never more than five people, but this particular set had a number of swaps during its four-month period. We work on a lot of products, so it's not uncommon to have team members get swapped out for one another. For no reason tied to this set, we had more swaps than normal. On the Creative team, Kelly was in charge of text and story and Cynthia was the art director. We worked closely with both of them on the worldbuilding to make sure the design and creative were in sync.</p>
</div>

<p>"Archery" is the beginning of a brand-new arc, taking a breather from the Gatewatch to visit a brand-new plane and watch the start of a new Planeswalker story. It was built as a spiritual successor to <em>Innistrad</em> using top-down genre tropes as a foundation. Let me begin with the vision statement:</p>

<p><strong><em>"Archery" is about letting the player tell their own story through gameplay.</em></strong></p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">In my vision design documents, I like to always have a vision statement, something that boils down what is going to make this set different from all other sets. One of the most important takeaways Set Design team members have to get from this document is a clear vision for where the design needs to be headed.</p>
</div>

<p>To best explain what I mean by this, I am going to use a metaphor. Imagine you purchased a LEGO set called "Superhero Movies of 2017." Inside the box were a number of bags. One bag was LEGO Wonder Woman. Another was LEGO Spider-Man. A third was LEGO Guardians of the Galaxy. Now you could put together Wonder Woman and the Amazon Warriors. You could assemble World War I soldiers and Captain Steve Rogers. You could recreate the whole Wonder Woman movie. Or you could put together Spider-Man and Iron Man and the Vulture. Or you could build all of the Guardians of the Galaxy, complete with their spaceship. Each build could be contained within the movie it comes from.</p>

<p>But there's a completely different way to play. You can put Wonder Woman's head on Gamora's body and give her web shooters. You could give Rocket Iron Man's armor and the Vulture's wings. You could mix and match to your heart's content.</p>

<p>That is what "Archery" is doing. It's playing around with archetypal pieces from Camelot and fairy tales. You can cast a Sleep Spell on the Beautiful Princess to await True Love's Kiss to wake her up. Or you can give a Poison Apple to the Fairy Godmother armed with Excalibur. The Vision team has been referring to the latter as the Mad Lib effect, letting players mix and match things that don't normally go together. We feel that both recreating the original story or playing Mad Libs will be satisfying game experiences.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Longtime readers will know I'm a big fan of metaphors. I find they do a great job of helping to ground a newer concept to something the audience is already familiar with. The big takeaway I had while working on <em>Throne of Eldraine</em> was that this was a top-down set that worked differently from other top-down sets because it was playing in a space that was a) well known, and b) created by combining familiar components. This lent itself very well to a modular system where players could enjoy watching how the various game pieces interacted with one another.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Also, because of the storytelling aspect of the genre we were playing with, the set itself wanted to be useful for telling stories. Yes, normal <em>Magic </em>does this to a certain extent, but not as loudly as <em>Throne of Eldraine</em> was going to. That's what I was conveying here. This was the thing that was going to make this set shine in its own unique way (aka, the vision).</p>

<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Also, note I'm referencing 2017. That's when I wrote this document. Vision design hands off two years before the set sees print.</p>
</div>

<p>The set breaks into two parts, the Camelot-inspired portion and the fairy-tale portion. I'm going to walk through how each is executed.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Today's column will be about the Camelot part of the design.</p>
</div>

<h1>CAMELOT</h1>

<p>"Archery" is an introduction to the plane of [name to come], the home of Planeswalkers Rowan and Will, and it is setting up the stability that the story begins with. We come to a relatively happy world. There are conflicts, but nothing that the infrastructure that has been built up over centuries can't handle. The stability of the world is communicated through what we are calling the Camelot portion of the set, where we tie into Arthurian mythology. It's the part that represents the structure of society and government on the Plane.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">If you remember my cake metaphor about <em>Throne of Eldraine</em>, that the Camelot part is the structural cake part and the fairy tale is the flashy icing part, this is me saying that without the cake metaphor (which I totally would have used had I come up with it at the time of the handoff).</p>
</div>

<p>The Camelot portion has the issue that we're doing something we do often enough—royalty and Knights in a medieval society—that it has a higher barrier to feel new. (Obviously, we're going to lean a lot on the creative to help with this.) Mechanically, we've chosen to give this a very structured identity. It has the loudest mechanical theme. It has the majority of the keywords. It has almost all the cycles. Its ethos is tied into the color wheel the strongest. The set is crafted to give the Camelot portion a strong structural weight to balance with the fairy-tale portion, which is going to pull focus, being the more novel part of the design.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">One of the important lessons of vision design was understanding what each portion of the set was responsible for. Camelot didn't have the depth of resonance that the fairy tales did, or the splash that would help the set feel new, but what it did have was a lot of structural elements we could build the world around. As Cynthia liked to put it, "We can't make a race of Cinderellas." This is me spelling out how and why the Camelot part fit structurally into the design of the set. Once again, Vision Design's main job is creating the blueprint that Set Design is going to build the set from. Most of the walls of the proverbial house were going to be built out of the Camelot portion of the set.</p>
</div>

<p>Here are all the things we are doing to give the Camelot portion its identity:</p>

<h2>The Courts</h2>

<p>The civilized world is broken up into five courts. As this is a <em>Magic</em> set, and the courts fill the role of providing the ethos for the world, each court is associated with one of the colors of <em>Magic</em>. Each court has its own structure and its own virtue that guides how it behaves.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">When crafting a new Plane, the Vision Design team has to work closely with the Creative team to figure out how the color pie is going to be expressed in the world. The color pie is <em>Magic</em>'s core foundation, and to make a plane feel like a <em>Magic </em>Plane, it's important we find a way to filter the world through the five colors. The idea of there being five courts, one of each color, happened very early (in exploratory design and worldbuilding).</p>
</div>

<p><strong>The White Court</strong></p>

<p>The white court values the virtue of loyalty. They are all about helping out one another for the greater good. From a mechanical standpoint, we play up effects that allow one creature to help another or things that help out the group as a whole.</p>

<p><strong>The Blue Court</strong></p>

<p>The blue court values the virtue of knowledge. They are the ones trying to improve the world through discovery. From a mechanical standpoint, we play up effects that interact with cards through things like drawing, looting, and scrying.</p>

<p><strong>The Black Court</strong></p>

<p>The black court values the virtue of persistence. They are the ones who are most steadfast in achieving their goals, taking the steps that are necessary to ensure the stability of the courts. From a mechanical standpoint, we play up black's ability to return from the graveyard, both to hand and to the battlefield.</p>

<p><strong>The Red Court</strong></p>

<p>The red court values the virtue of courage. They are the ones who believe the key to victory is never being afraid to take the offensive. From a mechanical standpoint, we play up red's aggressive nature in combat, giving them extra incentives to attack.</p>

<p><strong>The Green Court</strong></p>

<p>The green court values the virtue of strength. They are the ones who believe that the key to winning the important fights is to outpower the opponents. From a mechanical standpoint, we play up both green's size and its ability to make creatures bigger, both temporarily and permanently.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Note that as I explain the theme of each court, I also touch upon how it can connect to its mechanical identity.</p>
</div>

<p>Obviously, each of the virtues plays into mechanical space the color already focuses on, but we've notched it up a little to highlight it in the set. There are a number of cycles that play up the virtues of the courts:</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">A note before we jump into the mechanical aspects of the Camelot part of the set. Vision Design creates cards not because they're necessarily going to see print, but because they're proof of the concept of things that matter for the set and demonstrate possible ways to execute on them. For each mechanic, I'll explain what was important. Also, this document is not the only communication between the Vision Design team and the Set Design team. The lead designer usually talks with the Set Design team in person, and there's a lot of back and forth as set design progresses. Finally, I tend to put actual card designs in my vision design handoffs, as they do a good job of showing how what I'm talking about directly and concretely applies to the design. R&amp;D is trained to see things in card form, so I take advantage of that in my documents.</p>
</div>

<h2>Knight Cycle (Common)</h2>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier">Knight of Loyalty<br />
2W<br />
Creature — Human Knight<br />
2/2<br />
When CARDNAME enters the battlefield, Knights you control get +1/+1 until end of turn.</p>

<p>Common has cycles of Knights all labeled "Knight of [Virtue]." They are all 2M 2/2 creatures with an enters-the-battlefield effect that plays into the mechanical theme of its virtue.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This cycle was showing the need for something at common to help sell the virtues of the five courts (aka help play up the lens of the color pie on this world). Set design found other ways to do this.</p>
</div>

<h2>Oath Cycle (Common)</h2>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier">Oath of Persistence<br />
1B<br />
Enchantment — Aura<br />
Enchant black creature<br />
Enchanted creature gets +1/+1.<br />
When enchanted creature dies, return that card to the battlefield under its owner's control.</p>

<p>Common has an Aura cycle all labeled "Oath of [Virtue]." Each is an enchant creature that can only enchant that color (and thus is pushed a bit power-wise) and has an ability that plays into the mechanical theme of its virtue.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This cycle was demonstrating one of the ways the set could push monocolored play. Set design ended up not wanting to dedicate five common slots to an aura cycle.</p>
</div>

<h2>Quest Cycles (Uncommon and Rare)</h2>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier">Seek Lost Knowledge<br />
U<br />
Enchantment – Quest<br />
Hexproof<br />
(<em>Mark each task as you achieve it. When the Quest is completed, sacrifice it for your reward.)</em></p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier">• You control a Knight or Wizard<br />
• You draw two cards in one turn<br />
• You control an artifact<br />
Reward – Draw 3 cards</p>

<p>This mechanic will be explained more below. The uncommon cycle is designed for Limited play and the rare cycle is a Constructed build-around, all thematically tied to the courts. The flavor of the quests is that of Knights of that particular court being sent on an important mission. The rares could be tied to fairy-tale stories as well as Camelot.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This is the quest mechanic that I talked about in one of my preview articles. I'll talk more about this below.</p>
</div>

<h2>Banner Cycle (Uncommon)</h2>

<p>This uncommon artifact cycle shows off the banner for each court. They are artifacts that provide mana of the appropriate color and also have a triggered effect whenever you play a spell of the appropriate color. The effects are trying to play into the mechanical space of the court, but with a little more latitude as we don't want every court-themed cycle to have the same effects.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier">Bear Standard<br />
3<br />
Artifact<br />
Whenever you cast a green spell, target creature gets +2/+2 until end of turn.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Like with the Auras, the Vision Design team was a little more aggressive in trying to push monocolored play. The Set Design team found that it didn't have to push quite so hard to make it happen and removed a lot of these lower-rarity cycles.</p>
</div>

<h2>Court Castle Cycle (Uncommon)</h2>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier">Red Court Castle<br />
Land<br />
T: Add C<br />
1,T: Add RR</p>

<p>This uncommon land cycle shows off the courts in art and helps players play heavier color concentrations.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This was our attempt in making a cycle of lands to help support monocolor play in Limited. Set Design found it wasn't necessary.</p>
</div>

<h2>Leader Cycle (Rare)</h2>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier">Glorious Queen<br />
RB06<br />
BBB<br />
Creature – Elf Noble<br />
3/3<br />
Lifelink<br />
Whenever you cast a black spell, target opponent loses 1 life and you gain 1 life.</p>

<p>This cycle was designed around the leaders of each court. The cycle is all creatures that have a triggered effect when you play the appropriate color. They are similar to the banners but with slightly larger effects as the cycle is rare. This cycle could be tied to the courts through a means other than the leaders (maybe champions of the court), as those are probably going to be individually designed for flavor.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This cycle for the leaders did stick, and you can see how this card evolved into Ayara.</p>
</div>

<h2>Legendary Artifact Cycle (Rare)</h2>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier">Round Table<br />
3W (or 5)<br />
Legendary Artifact<br />
Knights you control get +1/+1.<br />
T: Add one mana of any color to your mana pool. Spend this mana only to cast Knight spells or to activate Knight abilities.</p>

<p>Each court has a special magical artifact that plays a big part in how the court functions in the story. These artifacts are all colored appropriately and have big splashy effects.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This cycle also stuck around, although, it went through many iterations in set design.</p>
</div>

<h2>Monocolor Play</h2>

<p>Each court has its own philosophy which it aggressively pushes. We reflect this in the set through a monocolor theme, that is cards that encourage you to play all or mostly one color. This is something we want to push for Limited with some players playing just one color and others playing a two-color deck that prioritizes one color over the other.</p>

<p><span class="spoiler">Note from the editor: No really, we removed this text. You can't see it yet. It isn't ready for you. You'll find out what's coming soon enough, but now is not the time. There will be a point at which, at some future date, you learn about the thing—this magical thing—being so unfairly hidden from you. And O, how wondrous will that day be. But it is not this day.</span></p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This paragraph talks about upcoming sets that aren't public yet, so I sadly have to black it out.</p>
</div>

<p>There are a number of tools built into the set to help with this monocolor theme:</p>

<p><strong>Choice Costs</strong></p>

<p>This is a tool bigger than just monocolor play, but has the biggest impact on this theme, so I'm going to talk about it here. Choice costs are mana costs where there are two mana costs in the upper right-hand corner. The current plan is that one cost is the primary cost and the second cost, now in parenthesis, is an alternate cost. The primary cost is used when determining converted mana cost. The plan is to put the cost with the heaviest concentration of color as the primary cost to help out devotion down the road.</p>

<p>Choice costs come into three categories: (I also list a fourth category we experimented with and abandoned.)</p>

<p><strong>Category #1: Cheaper costs through color concentration – 1WW (or 4W)</strong></p>

<p>This category rewards playing more of a single color by making spells cheaper to cast. This plays in the space we formerly used in two-brids, but this system both requires no math and allows us to change the correlation between colored and colorless mana on a cost-by-cost basis (two-brid requires a 2:1 ratio).</p>

<p><strong>Category #2: Extra effects through color concentration – 1WW (or 2W)</strong></p>

<p>This category rewards playing more of a single color by adding an additional rider to the spell. Currently in the file, each instance of this type of spell is labeled with the ability word "focus." The riders tend to do one of two things: make the effect larger or add a second effect that is synergistic with the first. The flavor we are going for is paying more color makes the spell feel "stronger."</p>

<p><strong>Category #3: Artifacts that can be cast cheaper with color – 1WW (or 6)</strong></p>

<p>This category is all artifact cards, both creatures and noncreatures, that lean toward a particular color. Using that color to cast them makes them cheaper. Note that regardless of the cost spent, the artifact is colored. This will matter with some of the other monocolor themes. Many of the colored artifacts are used flavorfully to hit some of the fairy-tale tropes (see more below).</p>

<p><strong>Category #4: Multicolor cards that can be cast with different color mana – 1WW (or 2U) – ABANDONED</strong></p>

<p>We experimented with this category because the monocolor theme likes having cards that can go into two different monocolor decks. To avoid being hybrid cards, the first attempt at this category had cards where the card had a cheaper cost in one of the two colors. When this proved unsatisfying, we tried cards where the converted mana cost was the same, but one cost had more concentration of colored mana. In the end, we just changed these into hybrid spells.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This is a good example where Vision Design pushes a theme a little bit harder to make something more novel and Set Design pulls back a bit using what they feel they need to accomplish their goals for the set. I was a big fan of the choice costs, but there was a lot of baggage that came with using them (the biggest being in rules interactions and confusion of what constituted the card's cost). Obviously, the adamant mechanic came out of this exploration. Of all the things pulled out in set design, this was actually the thing I was saddest to see leave as there was something very visceral I really liked about cards having two costs. It is the role of Vision Design to push toward new spaces and Set Design to challenge when and where it makes the most sense.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Color Restrictions</strong></p>

<p>This category helps out monocolor by having effects that either only work on a certain color or work better when targeting a certain color. The team experimented with a bunch of different cards in this space. The only thing still in the file is the Oath cycle that only enchants creatures of the appropriate color.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This went away because it wasn't needed to get people to play monocolor.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Color Triggers</strong></p>

<p>This category is filled with permanents that trigger whenever a spell of a particular color is cast. Both the uncommon banner cycle and rare leader cycle (see above) fall into this category.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This stayed, but was scaled back.</p>
</div>

<h2>Knight Flavor</h2>

<p>In a game centered on combat, an important part of capturing the Camelot feel is the Knights. We are capturing this in several ways:</p>

<p><strong>Knight Tribal</strong></p>

<p>All five colors will have Knights, each flavored to match their court. The Knight tribal cards are being focused into just two colors, white and black. This means you'll have many options when building a Knight tribal deck, but you'll have to use either white or black as one of the colors. The tribal effects have a Knight flavoring, so they tend to focus on rewards for summoning Knights or buffing your Knights in ways that will help them in combat.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">The Knight tribal component was added to red by Set Design, as they felt the theme was big enough for three colors (and allowed more Draft archetypes to access it).</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Combat Mechanic</strong></p>

<p>The attribute most associated with Knights is being a good fighter, so we felt it was important to have a combat mechanic in the set which shows up mostly, if not exclusively, on Knights. We've tried a bunch of mechanics:</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Chivalry N (<em>Whenever this creature blocks or becomes blocked, it gets +1/+1 until end of turn.</em>)</strong></p>

<p>This was a renamed bushido. It ended up being too weak on offense and too strong on defense.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Renown N (<em>When this creature deals combat damage to a player, if it isn't renowned, put N +1/+1 counters on it and it becomes renowned.</em>)</strong></p>

<p>This mechanic didn't make the Knights any better in combat and thus didn't do a great job of selling the "trained fighters" aspect. It did play up the "going on a quest" feel, but we're hitting that on another mechanic (see Quests below).</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Valiance (<em>Whenever this creature deals combat damage to a player, put a +1/+1 counter on it.</em>)</strong></p>

<p>This is the "Slith mechanic." The flavor wasn't bad, but it's snowball-y.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Cooperation (<em>Whenever this creature deals combat damage to a player, put a +1/+1 counter on another target creature.</em>)</strong></p>

<p>This variant on the "Slith mechanic" did a much better job of capturing how the Knights work together and was less snowball-y.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Joust N (<em>When this creature is blocked, it gets +0/+N until end of turn. If not blocked, it gets +N/+0 instead.</em>)</strong></p>

<p>This mechanic was a tweak on frenzy, adding a related effect if blocked to help with gameplay. The mechanic played well, but proved to be too hard to grok.</p>

<p><strong>Discipline N (<em>Whenever this card becomes blocked, put N +1/+1 counters on this card.</em>)</strong></p>

<p>This final combat mechanic is a tweak on bushido. It only works on attack, but has a permanent reward. This mechanic both played well in playtesting and adds to the growth/+1/+1 counter theme in the set.</p>

<p>The Vision Design team is recommending discipline, but more importantly, it's important for the Knights to have a named creature combat keyword even if Set Design chooses a different option.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">We spent a good deal of time exploring a Knight fighting keyword. The reason I included so many in this document was that we hadn't found the perfect answer for it and I wanted the Set Design team to see what we'd explored. I was hoping that our exploration might inspire them. In the end, Set Design decided it wasn't necessary for the Knights to have a keyword.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Quests</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier">Attack the Castle<br />
W<br />
Enchantment – Quest<br />
Hexproof<br />
(<em>Mark each task as you achieve it. When the Quest is completed, sacrifice it for your reward.)</em><br />
• You control a Knight or Soldier<br />
• You control an aura or equipment<br />
• You attack with at least three creatures<br />
Reward – Put two +1/+1 counters on each creature you control.</p>

<p>Besides fighting, another notable thing about Knights is that they go on quests. We've captured this with a new mechanic. Quest cards are enchantments that require three tasks to perform. The actions can be performed in any order. Once all three tasks have been performed, the Quest can be sacrificed for a larger effect. Whether it's automatically sacrificed or the controller can sacrifice it when they want to is a switch that can be toggled by Set Design. They all have hexproof to keep the opponent from destroying it moments before you complete the Quest.</p>

<p>We feel this mechanic can be the splashy mechanic of the set. The frame will require some work, especially something to help players mark which tasks they've completed. It's possible that the Quests are something other than enchantments (although, Vision Design recommends enchantments), maybe even a new card type. If that happens, they can lose hexproof.</p>

<p>The uncommon cycle is tied directly to the Knights and the courts. (Currently, the first task is having a Knight or other color-specific creature type.) The rare cycle can also be tied to the Knights or possibly to different fairy-tale stories.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Every set wants something splashy, and this was our attempt at that thing for <em>Throne of Eldraine</em>. Set Design did play with it for quite a while, but eventually decided that Adventure served the role of the splash in the set and it and Quest were a bit too close with one another to do both. Quest first showed up in original <em>Zendikar</em> design, but ended up not getting used there. I do hope to one day find a home for it.</p>
</div>

<h2>Build-Up Theme</h2>

<p>Another theme that runs through the whole set but leans toward the Camelot side is a build-up theme using positive Auras, Equipment, and +1/+1 counters. We can see Knights as they strengthen themselves with magic, weapons, and training. This theme is centered in white and green.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This theme got toned down quite a bit in set design, although, traces of it can still be seen.</p>
</div>

<h2>Camelot Tropes</h2>

<p>The final thing we did for the Camelot part of the set is hit a bunch of tropes:</p>

<p><strong>CW01 Loyal Squire –</strong> Every Knight has a faithful squire.</p>

<p><strong>CW03 Animated Suit of Armor –</strong> A common trope seen in pop culture.</p>

<p><strong>CW06 Castle Rampart –</strong> The courts are protected by their castle.</p>

<p><strong>CW07 Knight of Loyalty –</strong> White's part of the cycle of Knights of Virtue.</p>

<p><strong>CW08 Queen's Knight –</strong> Playing up the Knights' connection to the royalty. Also a subtle nod to the Guinevere and Lancelot story.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">While we made cards inspired by Guinevere and Lancelot, we chose to stay clear of the "Guinevere and Lancelot" story.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>CW09 Knight with Lance –</strong> The lance is a classic Knight weapon.</p>

<p><strong>CW10 Oath of Loyalty –</strong> White's part of the Oath of Virtue cycle. Playing into Knights making oaths to royalty.</p>

<p><strong>CW16 Strategic Strike –</strong> Capturing the Knights as strategic fighters.</p>

<p><strong>UW02 Honor-Bound Knight –</strong> Hitting the trope of Knights being honor-bound to duty.</p>

<p><strong>UW03 Court Wizard –</strong> The court always has a wizard or two to perform necessary magic.</p>

<p><strong>RW02 Pure Knight –</strong> One of the tropes is a knight of the highest moral standing.</p>

<p><strong>RW03 Challenging Knight –</strong> This Knight lives to challenge others to prove their worth.</p>

<p><strong>RW04 Just Queen –</strong> A queen of high moral standard.</p>

<p><strong>RW04 Queen Guinevere –</strong> The wife of the white leader who runs the white court in his absence, modeled after Queen Guinevere.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Often in vision design when two cards get designed that both can't coexist, we put them into the same slot to signify that one will eventually go. We don't often ship both to Set Design, but as this was a heavy top-down set, we did.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>RW06 Form the Round Table –</strong> The Round Table was the collection of knights that Arthur put together.</p>

<p><strong>RW09 Knightly Honor –</strong> Hitting the importance of honor among Knights.</p>

<p><strong>RW10 Round Table –</strong> The actual table the Knights of the Round Table sat around.</p>

<p><strong>RW11 Palace Dungeon</strong> – Every castle has a place to keep the prisoners.</p>

<p><strong>CU02 Wise Wizard –</strong> Another nod to the court wizards.</p>

<p><strong>CU05 Knight of Knowledge</strong> - Blue's part of the cycle of Knights of Virtue.</p>

<p><strong>CU06 Banishing Knight</strong> – Playing into the Knight's quest to rid the kingdom of the unwanted.</p>

<p><strong>CB05 Knight of Persistence -</strong> Black's part of the cycle of Knights of Virtue.</p>

<p><strong>CB06 Blacker Knight –</strong> Playing into the trope of the black Knight that ventured out to do evil deeds.</p>

<p><strong>CB08 Assassin's Assistant –</strong> Assassins were a dark part of the court.</p>

<p><strong>CB09 Returned Knight –</strong> Hitting the trope of the Zombie Knight brought back from the dead to serve a dark lord.</p>

<p><strong>CB10 Dark Crystal Ball –</strong> An object that lets wizards and witches peer into the future.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This and the Magic Mirror were deemed to be too similar, so this was dropped.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>CB11 Oath of Persistence -</strong> Black's part of the Oath of Virtue cycle. Playing into Knights making oaths to royalty.</p>

<p><strong>UB03 Deathless Knight –</strong> Some Knights have over-the-top claims about their prowess.</p>

<p><strong>UB13 The Dolorous Stroke –</strong> A wound that won't heal. The Fisher King had it.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This was one of the deeper-cut references that didn't make it. R&amp;D uses the term "deeper cut" to mean a top-down reference that only people who know the source material well will understand.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>RB02 Pretender to the Throne –</strong> Deceit at the highest levels.</p>

<p><strong>RB04 Backstabbing Assassin –</strong> Another nod at assassins that deal in high-level kills.</p>

<p><strong>RB05 Glorious Queen –</strong> A nod toward the concept of an evil queen.</p>

<p><strong>RB06 Witches' Cauldron –</strong> Main tool of witches.</p>

<p><strong>RB08 Draught of Morgan –</strong> A dark potion created by Morgan le Fey.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Another deeper-cut reference that didn't make it.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>CR03 Eager to Prove Knight –</strong> Playing into trope of a Knight who will do anything to prove himself.</p>

<p><strong>CR06 Knight of Courage -</strong> Red's part of the cycle of Knights of Virtue.</p>

<p><strong>UR02 Annoying Jester –</strong> The jester is another staple of the court.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Somehow, we ended up without any jesters. I assume that was a conscious decision by the Creative team.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>UR05 Knighted Dragonslayer –</strong> Playing into the trope of a Knight who slays dragons.</p>

<p><strong>UR07 Brave Knight –</strong> The trope of a Knight without fear.</p>

<p><strong>UR09 Win the Tournament –</strong> Knights compete in tournaments to show their prowess.</p>

<p><strong>UR12 Mystical Scroll –</strong> Another tool of Merlin.</p>

<p><strong>RR05 Kidnapping Dragon –</strong> The trope of a Dragon that kidnaps royalty (usually princesses).</p>

<p><strong>RR08 Sword in the Stone –</strong> Arthur became king because he pulled the sword out of the stone.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">There are actually two different famous swords tied to King Arthur. We included both in the vision design handoff, but we found in set design that most people thought they were the same sword, so we condensed them into one. When we return to Eldraine, I'll make sure to get a sword in the stone card as I was sad we were missing one. (It's one of the best-known tropes of Camelot).</p>
</div>

<p><strong>RR09 Magic Wand –</strong> Another iconic tool of wizards.</p>

<p><strong>RR10 Everlasting Tournament –</strong> The Red court has an ongoing tournament that never ends.</p>

<p><strong>CG05 Palace Knight –</strong> A Knight that guards the palace.</p>

<p><strong>CG07 Knight of Strength -</strong> Green's part of the cycle of Knights of Virtue.</p>

<p><strong>CG16 Joust –</strong> Jousting was a popular means for Knights to fight in public.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">As I explained, this would get changed to red as the red court is where the jousting happened on Eldraine.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>CG16 Oath of Strength -</strong> Green's part of the Oath of Virtue cycle. Playing into Knights making oaths to royalty.</p>

<p><strong>UG05 Strong Knight –</strong> A knight of unbelievable strength.</p>

<p><strong>UG06 Tourney Challenger –</strong> Someone, usually in disguise, who enters a tournament only to win it to everyone's surprise, often seen in Robin Hood stories.</p>

<p><strong>UG07 Questing Beast –</strong> Referring to a quest that involves killing a fearsome beast.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Here you can see that I was unaware this was a reference to a specific creature. (The same reason most people miss that this is a legendary creature).</p>
</div>

<p><strong>UG11 Wake the Sleeping Giant –</strong> A quest to interact with a giant.</p>

<p><strong>UG13 Rally the Troops –</strong> Playing up that Knights often come together to fight.</p>

<p><strong>RG04 Strong Queen –</strong> A queen capable of winning her own fights.</p>

<p><strong>RG09 Stonehenge –</strong> A classic ancient English monument, it has magical properties in this story.</p>

<p><strong>RZ04 Lady of the Lake –</strong> The creature that created Excalibur and put the sword in the stone.</p>

<p><strong>RZ05 Robin Hood –</strong> Meant to be a card that captures the Robin Hood archetype of an outcast that robs the rich to give to the poor.</p>

<p><strong>MZ01 Merlin Mentor –</strong> Nod to Merlin.</p>

<p><strong>CA05 Barrel of Swords –</strong> A weapons collection in a castle.</p>

<p><strong>UA04 Hound Standard –</strong> Crest of the white court.</p>

<p><strong>UA08 Bear Standard -</strong> Crest of the green court.</p>

<p><strong>RA01 Haunted Plate Mail –</strong> Haunted armor that moves by itself.</p>

<p><strong>MA01 Excalibur –</strong> Arthur's magical sword.</p>

<p><strong>UL01 White Court Castle –</strong> Shows off what the white court looks like.</p>

<p><strong>UL02 Blue Court Castle –</strong> Shows off what the blue court looks like.</p>

<p><strong>UL03 Black Court Castle –</strong> Shows off what the black court looks like.</p>

<p><strong>UL04 Red Court Castle –</strong> Shows off what the red court looks like.</p>

<p><strong>UL05 Green Court Castle –</strong> Shows off what the green court looks like.</p>

<p><strong>RL01 Knight's Quarters –</strong> Where the Knights live.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This isn't something we list in most vision design documents, usually only with top-down designs that have a lot of individual card-by-card design components. The fairy-tale list you'll see next week gets into a lot finer detail. We found the knowledge of Arthurian lore was lower, so I felt it best to list everything. This list also gets into general tropes of the genre as much as specific Camelot references as more of the world building was going to sit on the Camelot part of the set.</p>
</div>

<hr />
<p>Whew! As I explained above, there was too much to fit into one column, so I'll be back next week with the fairy-tale portion of the document. As always, I'm eager to hear your feedback about today's column. Did you like seeing this document and is it something you'd like me to do more of in the future? You can <a href="mailto:making.magic@hotmail.com">email me</a> or contact me through any of my social media accounts (<a href="https://twitter.com/maro254" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://markrosewater.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Tumblr</a>, and <a href="http://instagram.com/mtgmaro" target="_blank">Instagram</a>).</p>

It was too long, so today is part two. As with last week, the text below is the official document as it was turned in and the text in the boxes is my commentary.</p>

<hr />
<p>The next named mechanic is<strong> channel</strong>. This is the one mechanic we're bringing back from original <em>Kamigawa</em> block in the main set. Channel is a mechanic that allows you to pay mana and discard the card to generate an effect, usually thematically tied to the card it appears on.</p>

<p>Channel originally appeared in <em>Saviors of Kamigawa </em>and only on Spirit creature cards. In "Hockey," we're using channel exclusively on artifacts and enchantments, although that can include artifact creatures and enchantment creatures. Channel is allowing us to get more spell effects onto artifact and enchantment cards to raise their as-fan in the set. Some examples:</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Sudden Force</strong><br />
3G<br />
Enchantment — Aura<br />
Enchant creature<br />
Enchanted creature gets +3/+3 and has reach.<br />
<em>Channel</em> – 1G, Discard CARDNAME: Target creature gets +3/+3 and gains reach until end of turn.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Prototype Stunbot</strong><br />
2R<br />
Artifact Creature — Construct<br />
3/2<br />
When CARDNAME enters the battlefield, target creature can't block this turn.<br />
<em>Channel </em>– 4R, Discard CARDNAME. Creatures can't block this turn.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Set Design mostly kept channel to artifacts and enchantments but did add it to one other card type, lands. Dave was interested in making a cycle of legendary lands. Normally, we don't make legendary lands because we don't like the play pattern, but by adding channel to them, he was able to offset the drawback of legendary.</p>
</div>

<p>The unnamed mechanic is nicknamed <strong>"Balance," </strong>and it's a threshold mechanic where you get a bonus if you control both an artifact and an enchantment. There are two different ways we're executing it. First includes cards that give you a single reward if you have both:</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Determined Realist</strong><br />
3B<br />
Creature — Human Shaman<br />
3/4<br />
When CARDNAME enters the battlefield, if you control an artifact and an enchantment, draw a card and lose 1 life.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Imperial Intervention</strong><br />
W<br />
Instant<br />
Target creature you control gets +2/+2 until end of turn. If you control an artifact and an enchantment, instead put two +1/+1 counters on it.</p>

<p>Second are cards that give you a bonus for each, but the two abilities combine well together:</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Balanced Karateka</strong><br />
2B<br />
Creature — Rat Monk<br />
3/2<br />
CARDNAME has deathtouch as long as you control an artifact.<br />
CARDNAME has menace as long as you control an enchantment.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Flame War Veteran</strong><br />
4R<br />
Creature — Human Samurai<br />
3/5<br />
CARDNAME has +2/+0 as long as you control an artifact.<br />
CARDNAME has +2/+0 as long as you control an enchantment.</p>

<p>Balance is focused in black because it's the color in the center of the conflict (see above) and seen next most in white and red, the two support colors.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This ability ended up just being in black and white and got removed from red. Other than that, though, it mostly stayed the same. In fact, something happened that seldom happens in sets: a card design in the vision design handoff made it to print as is. Nezumi Bladeblesser is exactly Balanced Karateka with the sole exception that it's a Samurai instead of a Monk.</p>
</div>

<p>The set also has two <strong>tribal themes: Ninja/Rogue</strong> and <strong>Samurai/Warrior</strong>. Each tribe has the Japanese class creature type found in original <em>Kamigawa</em> block along with a more generic class creature type often used in <em>Magic</em>. Any card in the set that mechanically references the more specific creature type will reference the broader one as well. This is done to help build tribal connections in sets around it, as Ninjas and Samurai are tricky creature types to use in other sets. Both Ninjas and Samurai are centered in their original colors from <em>Kamigawa</em> block (blue and black for Ninjas and red and white for Samurai) but have an added third color to give the creature type something new (green for Ninja and black for Samurai). Some examples:</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Unlicensed Herbalist</strong><br />
4B<br />
Creature — Rat Cleric<br />
2/5<br />
When CARDNAME enters the battlefield, return target Ninja or Rogue card from your graveyard to your hand.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Intelligence Coordinator</strong><br />
1U<br />
Artifact Creature — Human Rogue<br />
2/1<br />
Whenever another Ninja or Rogue enters the battlefield under your control, Scry 1.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Ancestral Katana</strong><br />
1W<br />
Artifact — Equipment<br />
When CARDNAME enters the battlefield, attach it to target Samurai or Warrior you control.<br />
Equipped creature gets +2/+0.<br />
Equip 3 (<em>3: Attach to target creature you control. Equip only as a sorcery.</em>)</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Kendo Training</strong><br />
1R<br />
Enchantment<br />
Enchant creature<br />
As long as enchanted creature is a Samurai or Warrior, it gets +1/+1.<br />
When CARDNAME enters the battlefield, enchanted creature fights up to one target creature.</p>

<p>The Ninjas/Rogues and Samurai/Warriors do not serve any one side of the conflict. There are traditionalists, there are modernists, and others somewhere in the middle. This allows us to do both classic old-school ninjas and samurai as well as allowing us to have more modern, technological ones.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Ninjas did show up in number in green, but the only black Samurai is Nezumi Bladeblesser (I mean, they had to change something about the card). The biggest change from this handoff is the moving of ninjutsu into the main set, which meant that's what most Ninjas do.</p>
</div>

<h1>Draft Archetypes</h1>

<p>Here's our first pass at what each of the two-color combinations are doing in Draft.</p>

<p><strong>White-Blue</strong> – Vehicles</p>

<p>The set has several Vehicles/Mechs. We focused them into blue, white, and colorless such that white-blue could draft a Vehicle deck. This is probably one of the themes I most expect the Set Design team to change or expand upon.</p>

<p><strong>Blue-Black</strong> – Ninja/Rogue</p>

<p>This archetype is playing a very traditional blue-black sneaky style gameplay but flavored with a tribal Ninja/Rogue component.</p>

<p><strong>Black-Red</strong> – Artifacts in Graveyard</p>

<p>This archetype uses artifacts as a resource (sacrificing and discarding them) and then has numerous cards that can use the artifacts in the graveyard as a resource and/or returning them to battlefield/hand.</p>

<p><strong>Red-Green</strong> – Auras</p>

<p>This archetype is a midrange deck that makes use of Auras to help boost its creatures. It's one of the decks that also leans heavily on enhanced.</p>

<p><strong>Green-White</strong> – Enchantment Creatures</p>

<p>This deck cares about enchantments but is more focused on enchantment creatures through a go-wide strategy. Note that this is the archetype most on the tradition side of the conflict.</p>

<p><strong>White-Black</strong> – "Balance"</p>

<p>This is the archetype that most cares about trying to play a combination of artifacts and enchantments.</p>

<p><strong>Blue-Red</strong> – Install</p>

<p>This archetype plays into artifacts and specifically the install mechanic, which in turn plays nicely with enhanced. This is the color most on the modernity side of the conflict.</p>

<p><strong>Black-Green</strong> – +1/+1 Counters</p>

<p>This is another archetype playing with enhanced. This combination is about getting creatures onto the battlefield and then building them up with +1/+1 counters.</p>

<p><strong>Red-White</strong> – Samurai/Warrior</p>

<p>This is an aggro deck with a Samurai/Warrior tribal flavoring.</p>

<p><strong>Green-Blue</strong> – Channel</p>

<p>This is the color combination that plays most into the channel mechanic. It has ramp style gameplay that can play the cheaper side early and the more expensive side mid- to late game.</p>

<h1>Top-Down References</h1>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Not all vision designs get to the draft archetypes. Different designs evolve at different speeds, so sometimes we get there and sometimes it's all done in set design. Even when we do it in vision design, it usually changes a bunch in set design. Surprisingly, it didn't actually change all that much. Green-white is more "enchantments matter" than go-wide, and red-green was more equally about all the parts of modified, but the only color combination that's totally different from this document is black-green. Instead of caring about +1/+1 counters, it's focused on recursion.</p>
</div>

<p>A big part of "Hockey" is that it's a top-down set based on both original <em>Kamigawa</em> block (and its inspirations from Japanese mythology) and Japanese pop culture. Below are the guidelines for all the references we make in the current card file separated into the two categories:</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Usually when doing a top-down set, we'll outline all the references in the vision design handoff document so that the Set Design team is aware of which cards are making a reference. As <em>Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty</em> makes a lot of references, we wanted to spell them out.</p>
</div>

<h1><em>Kamigawa</em> Block References in "Hockey"</h1>

<p><strong>Ability: <em>"Channel"</em></strong> – Direct pull from original <em>Saviors of Kamigawa</em>. Previously appeared only on Spirits. Aiming to appear exclusively on enchantments and artifacts here.</p>

<p>Almost all creature types are pulled directly from <em>Kamigawa</em>. Most relevant are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Fox "Kitsune"</li>
	<li>Moonfolk</li>
	<li>Rat "Nezumi"</li>
	<li>Goblin "Akki"</li>
	<li>Snake "Orochi" (still in discussion how large this segment will appear)</li>
	<li>Ninja</li>
	<li>Samurai</li>
	<li>Spirit</li>
</ul>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">As I explained in my preview article, one of the things we knew the fans of <em>Kamigawa</em> really wanted was the main creature types to return, so the plan from the very beginning was to bring them all back. The one exception was the Orochi. We weren't very happy with their original visual execution, so we did discuss a timeline where they would have died off by present day but thought players would be happier with a revamped version (they don't have legs) rather than no Orochi.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Colorless 1/1 Spirit tokens without flying</strong> – These are the primary creature tokens made in original <em>Kamigawa</em> block.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">These also stayed in the set.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Ninjas</strong> – While these don't have ninjutsu like previous Kamigawan Ninjas (although it will appear in the Ninja Commander deck), they should play well with them and feel "tricky" and "elusive" overall.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Ninjutsu obviously returned to the main set.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Samurai</strong> – While these don't have bushido like previous Kamigawan Samurai, they should play well with them and feel combat oriented.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">And they do.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>CW06: Taming of the Moths</strong> – Saga referencing Kamigawa moths being trained and used by the emperor. Becomes flying Insect, like previous moths.</p>

<p><strong>CW17: Michiko's Reign</strong> – Saga referencing Lord Konda's daughter, Michiko, ruling during her lifetime. Becomes a 2/2 Human like previous Michiko card.</p>

<p><strong>UW01: Isamaru Defends Eiganjo</strong> – Saga telling the story of how Isamaru (Konda's faithful hound) would rally his troops in battle. Becomes a 2/2. This is famous for being a legendary one-mana 2/2.</p>

<p><strong>UW03: Majestic Kirin</strong> – Flying Kirin mechanically tied to the set. Previous Kirin triggered off casting Spirits or Arcane spells.</p>

<p><strong>UW11: Genju of Rice (and all other Genjus)</strong> – Reference to cycle of <em>Kamigawa</em> enchantments that animate lands. Previous cycle returned the Aura to your hand when the land died. Current cycle saves your land only.</p>

<p><strong>RW03: Michiko and Kyodai</strong> – At the end of the <em>Kamigawa</em> story, the spirit stolen by Konda "Kyodai" formed a bond with Konda's daughter "Michiko" where they became one and restored balance between the spirit and mortal realms.</p>

<p><strong>RW05: Kitsune Outwit the Akki</strong> – Saga generally playing up the cleverness of the Kitsune and the dimwittedness of the Akki. No direct reference.</p>

<p><strong>RW06: Yoichi, the Morning Star (and all other Stars)</strong> – Referencing the cycle of Spirit Dragons in <em>Champions of Kamigawa</em> with death triggers.</p>

<p><strong>RU02: Scion of Sakashima</strong> – Reference to the well-known Shapeshifter, Sakashima the Imposter. Should stay Shapeshifter creature type and 3/1 PT if able.</p>

<p><strong>CB02: Haunting of Takenuma Swamp</strong> – General reference to the swamp areas of Takenuma. Effects are not a direct callback to anything.</p>

<p><strong>CB19: Caress of Night</strong> – Referring to the Myojin of Night's Reach, a powerful Kami that aided Toshiro Umezawa in his adventures. She is typically associated with discard abilities.</p>

<p><strong>UB01: Adventures of Toshiro Umezawa</strong> – Saga referencing the main character, Toshiro Umezawa, from the <em>Kamigawa</em> story. First two acts are abilities from <a class="autocard-link" data-image-url="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Umezawa%27s+Jitte" href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Umezawa%27s+Jitte">Umezawa's Jitte</a>, then becomes a 2/2 Human Samurai with bushido 1 like previous Toshiro card.</p>

<p><strong>UB07: Revenge of Night's Reach</strong> – Saga referring to the Myojin of Night's Reach, a powerful Kami that aided Toshiro Umezawa in his adventures. This isn't referencing any specific moment in time, but more aligned to her discard abilities from previous <em>Kamigawa</em>.</p>

<p><strong>MB51: Tomiko Umezawa</strong> – Descendent of Toshiro Umezawa. This will be the fourth Umezawa family member. They have not yet had a through line in abilities.</p>

<p><strong>CR06: Hidetsugu Pillages Minamo</strong> – Saga referencing when the ogre, Hidetsugu, destroyed the school of Minamo and stationed himself there. Rummaging and then becoming the menacing ogre is flavorful but not a direct reference to previous Hidetsugu card.</p>

<p><strong>CR19: Yamabushi's Spark</strong> – Yamabushi cards, stemming from Kumano the Master Yamabushi, all exile creatures that they would otherwise kill, showing their dominance in battle over spirits.</p>

<p><strong>RR03: Kiki-Jiki Aids the Tide Star</strong> – Referencing the famous akki "Kiki-Jiki Mirror Breaker" and how he helped Keiga the Tide Star retrieve the dragon's pearl back from Oboro, the palace in the sky. Acts I–II play up his cloning abilities, then Act III becomes the 2/2 Goblin like previous Kiki-Jiki that creates a treasure "the pearl" when successfully getting through blockers.</p>

<p><strong>RR04: Hidetsugu, Oni of Chaos</strong> – Referencing the ogre Hidetsugu and how after a life of worship to the Oni of Chaos, he becomes a demon. Mechanics not directly tied to previous card and probably shouldn't be.</p>

<p><strong>CG01: Jukai Gardener</strong> – Small tie to <a class="autocard-link" data-image-url="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Budoka+Gardener" href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Budoka+Gardener">Budoka Gardener</a> in <em>Champions of Kamigawa</em>.</p>

<p><strong>CG02: Kainu Duelist</strong> – Functional bushido 1 reference. Would love to get more of this in the set if able as one of the few mechanical connections.</p>

<p><strong>CG10: Boseiju Rises Above</strong> – Boseiju is a legendary tree in original <em>Kamigawa</em> that will be a main landmark in New Kamigawa. This Saga represents Boseiju rising above the growing metropolis. Not currently a mechanical tie.</p>

<p><strong>CG13: Commune with the Kami </strong>– Direct reference to <a class="autocard-link" data-image-url="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Commune+with+Nature" href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Commune+with+Nature">Commune with Nature</a> that premiered in <em>Kamigawa</em>. No strong connection.</p>

<p><strong>UG01: Budoka Monks Defend the Temple</strong> – General reference to Kamigawa monks fighting off intruders, previously angry kami, and bandits from their sanctuaries.</p>

<p><strong>UG03: Kappa Ninja</strong> – In <em>Champions of Kamigawa</em>, we had <a class="autocard-link" data-image-url="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Shell+of+the+Last+Kappa" href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shell+of+the+Last+Kappa">Shell of the Last Kappa</a>. If they aren't back in full here, it is charming to have one. This specifically is a Turtle Ninja joke.</p>

<p><strong>UG05: Azusa's Journeys</strong> – Referencing popular legendary creature Azusa from the Jukai forest who would travel across Kamigawa documenting her journey.</p>

<p><strong>UG40: Rite of Spring</strong> – Reference to <a class="autocard-link" data-image-url="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Kodama%27s+Reach" href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kodama%27s+Reach">Kodama's Reach</a> from <em>Champions of Kamigawa</em>.</p>

<p><strong>RG54: Kodama of the West Tree</strong> – North/Center/South Tree were in OG <em>Kamigawa</em>. East Tree is in Chevron. This will complete the cycle. There aren't direct ties between the other four.</p>

<p><strong>MZ01: O-Kagachi's Rampage</strong> – Refencing the legendary dragon spirit, O-Kagachi, rampaging across the land in search of That Which Was Taken—aka his spirit daughter. Current acts are vague flavor references, but it should remain a WUBRG Dragon Spirit that is a 6/6 flyer.</p>

<p><strong>MZ52: Tamiyo Hole</strong> – Tamiyo is our known Kamigawan Planeswalker. Will likely be Phyrexianized in this set. Stay tuned.</p>

<p><strong>UA03: Humble Bokken</strong> – Equipment designed to get more board-permanent bushido references in the set, since our one or two creatures die so easily.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">As you can see, even at handoff, the plan had been to have a lot of references to original <em>Kamigawa</em>. Some of these references stayed, some didn't, but it did set the tone for the volume of callbacks we wanted the set to have.</p>
</div>

<h1>Japanese Pop Culture References in "Hockey"</h1>

<p>These cards are references to existing Japanese media or existing notions in Japanese culture, whether fictional or historical. I'm explaining in broad terms what they're about so that if the top-down reference is to remain, it should try to remain with these descriptions in mind.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">I should stress that the plan was always to have a cultural consultant; that's just something that happens later in the process, so a lot of this list comes from our best guesses of what we might want, which would then be looked at, adapted, and/or removed by the consultant. The consultant would also be able to add things, but all of that would happen during set design. If you <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoDigd9xl_c&amp;t=1s" target="_blank">watched the video of the creative round table for <em>Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty</em></a>, there's a good example of our creative consultant talking about why he didn't want Nunchaku in the set.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>RZ04: Beyond the Veil</strong> – Glimpsing the deity or force that governs life and death.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">I'm very proud of how <em>Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty</em> turned out. A big thanks to my Exploratory Design and Vision Design teams, to Dave Humpherys and his Set Design team, to the Creative team, the Play Design team, and all the other talented people who helped bring this set to life. If you had asked me even five years ago if we'd ever return to Kamigawa, I would have given you a firm no, so it's exciting to see it come to fruition.</p>

In it, the lead vision designer explains their team's vision for the set and walks the Set Design team through all the thought that went into making the vision, including showing off the many mechanics the Vision Design team has created. I started showing these vision design handoff documents in my column, and they've been very popular. Here are the ones I've previously published:</p>

<p>As I just walked you through <em>Kamigawa: Neon</em> <em>Dynasty</em>'s vision design over the last two weeks (<a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/making-dynasty-part-1-2022-01-27" target="_blank">Part 1</a> and <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/making-dynasty-part-2-2022-01-31" target="_blank">Part 2</a>), I thought it would be fun to look at the set's vision design handoff document. The document's big enough that I need to break it into two parts. As with all my vision design handoff articles, this is the official document as it was turned in with commentary inside the blue boxes.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">As always, I start by listing everyone from my Vision Design, Exploratory Design, and Worldbuilding teams. These are the three groups primarily responsible for crafting the earliest concepts of what the set is. I introduced the individual members of my Exploratory and Vision Design teams in <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/making-dynasty-part-1-2022-01-27" target="_blank">my first <em>Kamigawa:</em> <em>Neon Dynasty</em> preview article</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>For many years, we've talked about doing another Japanese-inspired set. There were two options:</p>

<ol>
	<li>We could revisit Kamigawa, the Japanese-inspired world we released back in 2004 built around Japanese mythology, or</li>
	<li>We could build a brand-new Japanese-inspired world inspired by Japanese pop culture tropes with a more modern take.</li>
</ol>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">When I talk about "Japanese pop culture tropes" in this document, I'm talking about Japanese tropes that come from pop culture produced in Japan and not elsewhere.</p>
</div>

<p>I should point out that once I was convinced that the set we were making wanted to be Kamigawa, there was still a lot of various stakeholders to convince, and I couldn't have done it without the help of numerous people also rallying for Kamigawa (Jess Lanzillo and Aaron Forsythe among many others).</p>

<p>The former would be nostalgic and tap into a feel of more ancient Japan. The latter would be more pop culturally resonant and tap into a feel of more modern Japan. After much deliberating, we chose to do<nbsp>. . .</nbsp>both.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">When we started this project, I had pushed hard for us to table deciding whether this was Kamigawa until we'd gotten a better handle on what the set was. While in my heart, I wanted it to be a return to Kamigawa, I had to see if I could build a set where that desire was what was best for the product we were making. Luckily, it was.</p>
</div>

<p>It turns out that while exploring a conflict engine for the world, we stumbled upon an interesting recurring conflict seen throughout Japanese pop culture—tradition versus modernity. That is, the conflict of caring about the world through the lens of the past versus seeing the world through the lens of the future. Do you hold onto the traditions of how things have always been, or do lean toward the promise of new possibilities? Yes, it turns out the conflict engine most natural to the world pits our two world concepts against one another.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">I work on a lot of sets, and it's easy to mix up small details. One thing I was reminded of after I wrote my preview articles was that the idea of the tradition-versus-modernity conflict was not first brought up during vision design but during exploratory design by Chris Mooney. It's a great example of the influence a designer who worked on the set during exploratory design can have on a product.</p>
</div>

<p>In addition, when we started exploring this conflict, we found an elegant way to map it mechanically. The tradition side cares about enchantments as they reflect the inherent ancient magic of the world that has existed on the plane for a millennium. The modernity side cares about artifacts, because it represents technology and the latest innovations. Artifacts and enchantments have an interesting dynamic in that they feel like opposites yet function alike mechanically, allowing us to pit them against one another flavorfully while still making a lot of mechanical synergies where you'd want to play them together. While we've done individual artifact-centric and enchantment-centric planes, we've never done one where they coexisted, giving Kamigawa a distinct mechanical identity.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">I'm kind of shocked we've never done the artifact/enchantment conflict as a core set theme before. It seems like something we would have done. The main reason we haven't is because it uses a lot of design technology we've crafted over the years when making artifact-centric and enchantment-centric sets. I think we had to build up the technology to allow us to get to a place where we could make it work.</p>
</div>

<p>Working with the Creative team (and the color pie), we assigned a color to each side of the main conflict with a supporting color and one color positioned in the middle.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Tradition&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Modernity</strong></p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Green ---------------- White --------------- Black --------------- Red ---------------- Blue</strong></p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">In my preview article, I explained how we made this chart. I didn't really give any props to the color pie, which is so well crafted that it just spits answers like this out instantaneously. It literally took us thirty seconds to come up with it, and it lasted for the duration of the design. One of the reasons I'm such a champion of the color pie is because of how powerful and useful it is as a <em>Magic</em> design tool. It really is the secret sauce of <em>Magic</em>.</p>
</div>

<p>The end colors will focus on their side but have a little bit of the opposite side (somewhere around an 80/20 split). The support colors will lean toward their side but not as strongly (somewhere around a 65/35 split), and the central color will be 50/50. The idea is that you can play any combination of colors and lean toward either side, but certain colors will more likely push you in one direction. Green-white and blue-red decks, for example, will most often be of their respective sides, while white-black and black-red will more often be evenly balanced. (More on this below.)</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">I haven't checked the numbers, but my gut says that the Set Design team kept the general relationship between the end colors, the support colors, and the middle color the same but shifted the actual numbers to whatever made the set work best in all the various formats.</p>
</div>

<p>Let's look at both sides of this conflict.</p>

<h1>Tradition</h1>

<p>This side is the side that taps into the <em>Kamigawa </em>block. In story time, 1,500 years have passed since we were last on the plane (even in the story timeline from when it was released, the <em>Kamigawa</em> block took place in the past), so most references to the <em>Kamigawa </em>block are referencing the old part of the world. This section of the world gets to play up the plane as players remember it from <em>Champions of Kamigawa </em>block. We get to revisit familiar races, memorable locations, ancient objects, and characters or ancestors of characters whom players remember.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">First up, it was 1,200 years and not 1,500. Oops.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">I knew from early on that I wasn't interested in bringing back much in terms of named mechanics from <em>Champions of Kamigawa</em> block. There just wasn't all that much to salvage, and very little of it fit the larger artifact/enchantment structure I wanted to build the set around. Channel was the only one that both played well and fit into our structure, so that's why it got chosen. As I said in my preview article, I dislike how large in scope channel is, but I didn't really have much else to work with. I believe Dave's decision to pull ninjutsu into the main set was correct, as I think there was such a strong expectation of it being there. However, I'm happy that there are a few Ninjas in the set without ninjutsu. Finally, I'm proud of all the work everyone did to make so many connections to individual cards and cycles from <em>Champions of Kamigawa</em> block. It's kind of daunting how we managed to fit everything in the set.</p>
</div>

<p>As far as mechanics go, we're suggesting we bring back one mechanic from the <em>Kamigawa </em>block (channel, which I'll talk about more below) in the main set and one in a Commander deck (ninjutsu, which would go into a Ninja deck). Other than that, the nostalgic mechanical aspects of the set will be conveyed more through the design of single cards and cycles that will harken back to memorable cards and/or cycles from the <em>Kamigawa </em>block. The mechanics from the original block aren't where we want to put our focus in this set, choosing instead to lean into the more popular flavor aspects.</p>

<p>This part of the set will have an enchantments theme, including enchantment creatures. It will also include <strong>Saga creatures</strong>. Here's how they work. The Sagas in this set are all stories about characters from the past (mostly from or referencing the <em>Kamigawa </em>block) that transform into an enchantment creature of that character as an effect of their last chapter.</p>

<p>Here are some examples:</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Isamaru Defends Eiganjo</strong><br />
2W<br />
Enchantment — Saga<br />
(<em>As this Saga enters and after your draw step, add a lore counter, Sacrifice after III.)</em><br />
I-II: Create a 1/1 white Soldier creature token.<br />
III: This permanently becomes a Dog enchantment creature.<br />
//<br />
Creature — Hound<br />
2/2<br />
Whenever this creature attacks, other creatures you control get +1/+1 until end of turn.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Boseiju Rises Above</strong><br />
4G<br />
Enchantment — Saga<br />
(<em>As this Saga enters and after your draw step, add a lore counter, Sacrifice after III.)</em><br />
I-II: Target creature you control gets +2/+2 until end of turn.<br />
III: This permanently becomes a Spirit enchantment creature.<br />
Creature — Spirit<br />
5/5</p>

<p>Note that when the Sagas become creatures, they remain enchantments, becoming enchantment creatures, but stop being Sagas, meaning they lose the lore counters.</p>

<p>The intent is that these are single-sided cards with a tweaked Saga frame communicating the creature aspect of the card, but the Set Design team is free to look into double-faced card executions. The Vision Design team avoided this path due to the high volume of DFCs in sets leading up to this ("Diving" through "Clubs" all use some form of double-faced cards and <strong>[REDACTED]</strong>), but we acknowledge it's an exciting execution possibility in a vacuum.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Obviously, the Set Design team did decide to use double-faced cards to execute on this mechanic. It turned out it was just a significantly cleaner execution. Getting all the information for the Saga and the creature on one side was just a bit much. This choice also allows them turn into more complicated creatures. The censored material references the future, and thus, I had to remove it.</p>
</div>

<h1>Modernity</h1>

<p>This is the side that taps into the more modern Japanese pop culture tropes. This side cares about artifacts and will include colored and colorless artifact creatures. This section is going to be the one that pushes into a lot of the resonance that the <em>Kamigawa </em>block did not due to its focus on older elements based on Japanese mythology.</p>

<p>Artifact creatures will represent creatures that have upgraded themselves with some form of magical technology. The Equipment will be higher technology (for <em>Magic </em>at least—think <em>Kaladesh</em>) tools and/or lean into pop culture tropes, weapons, and upgrades. The Vehicles will be mechs.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">You can see from this document that I spend a little more time defining what the modernity side is with card designs, as it was doing something brand new and unlike the tradition side that was tapping into a whole block's worth of cards. I think it's important in this document to provide a lot of card examples to help the Set Design team get a sense of how you see the set. And yes, Assembly Squadron became Mechtitan Core.</p>
</div>

<p>The mechanic unique to this side will be <strong>install</strong>. Install is a mechanic that goes onto artifact creatures and allows them to turn into Equipment. There is a single cost to equip and unequip. Whenever the creature is equipped, it's an Equipment, and whenever it is unequipped (including when it falls off because the equipped creature dies), it's just an artifact creature and not an Equipment. It always stays an artifact. Here are some examples:</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Spy Drone</strong><br />
2U<br />
Artifact Creature — Equipment<br />
2/2<br />
Whenever CARDNAME or an equipped creature deals combat damage to a player, draw a card.<br />
Instill 5 (<em>5: Attach this card to target creature you control or unattach it. Install only as a sorcery. This card enters the battlefield unattached and stays on the battlefield if the creature it equips leaves the battlefield. While attached, this card is not a creature.)</em></p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Lifeforce Drone</strong><br />
1B<br />
Artifact Creature — Equipment<br />
2/1<br />
Lifelink<br />
Equipped creature has lifelink.<br />
Instill 5 (<em>5: Attach this card to target creature you control or unattach it. Install only as a sorcery. This card enters the battlefield unattached and stays on the battlefield if the creature it equips leaves the battlefield. While attached, this card is not a creature.)</em></p>

<p>Like Saga creatures, install doesn't need to be of a high as-fan because each card is pretty impactful.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Usually, there's a decent gap between the templating that comes out of vision design and what gets printed on cards. Obviously, reconfigure includes some extra text, but I'm impressed how close we got. The mechanic got a lot of scrutiny because they're similar to the Licids from the <em>Tempest </em>block, and internally, those are considered to be a mistake.</p>
</div>

<h1>Overarching Mechanics and Themes</h1>

<p>Each side has a mechanic dedicated to its side, but the set also has two named mechanics and one unnamed mechanic, as well as some mechanical themes, that stretch across both sides. These three mechanics are intended to be the glue that encourages players to mix and match artifacts and enchantments.</p>

<p>The first named mechanic is <strong>enhanced</strong>. Enhanced refers to any creature that is equipped, enchanted, or has counters on it. (The set currently only uses +1/+1 counters.) Enhanced can be used numerous ways. It can be on a creature, which gets an upgrade if it's enhanced:</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Skywire Infiltrator</strong><br />
1B<br />
Creature — Human Ninja<br />
1/1<br />
Flying<br />
Whenever CARDNAME attacks, if it's enhanced, defending player loses 1 life. (<em>A creature is enhanced if it's equipped, enchanted, or has a counter on it.</em>)</p>

<p>It can be used on a creature that's upgraded if you control an enhanced creature:</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Inspired Pupil</strong><br />
2G<br />
Creature — Human Monk<br />
3/2<br />
CARDNAME enters the battlefield with a +1/+1 counter if you control an enhanced creature. (<em>A creature is enhanced if it's equipped, enchanted, or has a counter on it.</em>)</p>

<p>It can be used on a spell that's upgraded if you control an enhanced creature:</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Augmented Blast</strong><br />
2R<br />
Sorcery<br />
CARDNAME deals 3 damage to target creature. If you control an enhanced creature, CARDNAME also deals 3 damage to each opponent. (<em>A creature is enhanced if it's equipped, enchanted, or has a counter on it.</em>)</p>

<p>Of all the named mechanics, this is the one that can be put on instants and sorceries. Enhanced helps encourage players to play Equipment, Auras, and permanents/spells that make use of +1/+1 counters.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">A couple things about modified: First, we'd tried using it in <em>Kaldheim</em>, and it ended up being cut down to three cards (<a class="autocard-link" data-image-url="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Halvar%2C+God+of+Battle" href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Halvar%2C+God+of+Battle">Halvar, God of Battle</a>; <a class="autocard-link" data-image-url="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Koll%2C+the+Forgemaster" href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Koll%2C+the+Forgemaster">Koll, the Forgemaster</a>; and <a class="autocard-link" data-image-url="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Warchanter+Skald" href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warchanter+Skald">Warchanter Skald</a>). I believe the original keyworded version did reference counters but lost that detail when the keyword was removed. When we were looking for a spell mechanic that would mechanically be relevant to both sides, we remembered modified and put it into the file. Often in vision design handoffs, I'll list a bunch of ways to execute a mechanic, and the Set Design team will only use one or two executions. Here, they used all three. The Set Design team did add a few other counters beyond +1/+1 counters.</p>

These are the metaphorical blueprints that the Set Design team will use to go build the set. I showed the vision design handoff for <em>Throne of Eldraine </em>(<a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/throne-eldraine-vision-design-handoff-part-1-2019-11-11" target="_blank">Part 1</a> and <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/throne-eldraine-vision-design-handoff-part-2-2019-11-18" target="_blank">Part 2</a>) and <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/ikoria-vision-design-handoff-2020-05-04" target="_blank"><em>Ikoria</em></a>, and they went over well, so I figured you all might like to see the one for <em>Zendikar Rising</em>.</p>

<p>Before we jump in, let me just say a few things. One, I'll be making asides in the boxes on the right. Anything that isn't an aside is the actual document. Two, a lot can change during set design, so when things deviate, I'll explain why and how they changed in set design. Three, as this is an internal document, at one point I talk about how this set impacts future sets, but that isn't public knowledge yet, so I blacked it out. (Sorry.) I hope you all enjoy this truly behind-the-scenes document.</p>

<h1>"Diving" Vision Design Handoff Document</h1>

<p><strong>Vision Design Team</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Mark Rosewater (lead)</li>
	<li>Andrew Veen</li>
	<li>Erik Lauer</li>
	<li>George Fan</li>
	<li>Tom Ross</li>
</ul>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">I always like to start my vision design handoff document explaining the big picture of what we're doing. This is important because the Set Design team will change things along the way as they build the set, but we want to make sure everyone is headed toward the same goal. Recapturing the essence of the original <em>Zendikar </em>was always the driving force of this design.</p>
</div>

<p>"Diving" is a return to <em>Zendikar</em>. Here are the parameters we chose to work under:</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>We're revisiting "adventure world" Zendikar, reminiscent of original <em>Zendikar </em>and <em>Worldwake</em>.</strong></li>
</ol>

<ol>
	<li value="2"><strong>There will be no Eldrazi, but there will be a nod to the impact of them having been there.</strong></li>
</ol>

<ol>
	<li value="3"><strong>The set will lean into "adventure world" tropes.</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>The key goal for the set's vision is to try and recapture what made the audience fall in love with Zendikar before the Eldrazi escaped and shifted the focus of the plane. A big part of this is steering back into the rich top-down trope space of "adventure world."</p>

<h1>A World of Adventure</h1>

<p>Here are the mechanics the Vision Design team created:</p>

<h2>Party</h2>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Kor Blademaster</strong><br />
1W<br />
Creature – Kor Ally Warrior<br />
First strike<br />
Whenever Kor Blademaster attacks, it gets +1/+1 for each creature in your party until end of turn. (<em>Your party consists of up to one each of Cleric, Rogue, Warrior, and Wizard</em>.)<br />
1/1</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Loot Drop</strong><br />
2U<br />
Instant<br />
Draw a card for each creature in your party. (<em>Your party consists of up to one each of Cleric, Rogue, Warrior, and Wizard</em>.)</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">When showing off a new mechanic, I always make sure to include actual card designs. The reason for this is that it's the easiest way for everyone to get a sense of what the mechanic is and how it might be executed. Notice that here, I showed both a creature and a spell with party right off the bat to demonstrate the variety of how the mechanic can be used.</p>
</div>

<p>Party is a mechanic representing an adventure party gathering together. It's tribal, but rather than wanting you to have a lot of the same creature type, you're trying to get one of each of four class creature types (Cleric, Rogue, Warrior, and Wizard, specifically). Party is the mechanic that goes on Allies. Every Ally is one of the four class types, and every creature with one of the four class types is an Ally. (We're currently experimenting with the relevant class being listed last, after Ally, to be easier to locate on the card.)</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">It was 100% my intent for Allies to be a part of <em>Zendikar Rising</em>. I know from both our market research and my interaction with players that Allies are a fan favorite of the world. The problem was that party takes up the same flavor space as Allies (that is, they represent the adventuring party trope we want to hit) and both require creature type support. It was my hope that we could just cram everything on the type line and live with the extra text as a byproduct of making the set more backwards compatible with past Zendikar sets. Unfortunately, the text didn't fit when the creature was legendary, and it felt very odd for everyone but the legendary creatures to be Allies. We talked about adding "This creature is an Ally," but it was text that didn't mean anything within the context of this set (save Tazri), so sadly, we made the choice to drop the Ally creature type from the set.</p>
</div>

<p>For each color (other than green, which is handled differently) one of the four creature types is primary, secondary, tertiary, or absent. Currently, if the class is primary in a color, it has three commons, two uncommons, and a various number of rares of that class. If it is secondary, it has two commons, two uncommons, and various rares of that class. If it is tertiary, it has at least one common and one uncommon of that class. If it is absent, you have no cards of that class. Green isn't primary in any color but has a presence in all four classes.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">It's common during vision design to map out a rough model of as-fan to give a sense of roughly how big of a space we expect a mechanic will take up. This is just an estimate though. Set Design will figure out the exact needs as they build the set. In the case of helping set up party, Vision Design guessed a little low. Common actually had four creatures of the primary creature type at common and three at uncommon (with red having four).</p>
</div>

<p>Here's the breakdown:</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;"><strong>White</strong><br />
Primary: Cleric<br />
Secondary: Warrior<br />
Tertiary: Wizard<br />
Absent: Rogue</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;"><strong>Blue</strong><br />
Primary: Wizard<br />
Secondary: Rogue<br />
Tertiary: Cleric<br />
Absent: Warrior</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;"><strong>Black</strong><br />
Primary: Rogue<br />
Secondary: Cleric<br />
Tertiary: Warrior<br />
Absent: Wizard</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;"><strong>Red</strong><br />
Primary: Warrior<br />
Secondary: Wizard<br />
Tertiary: Rogue<br />
Absent: Cleric</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;"><strong>Green</strong><br />
Primary: None<br />
Secondary: None<br />
Tertiary: All<br />
Absent: None</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Vision Design will also explore how structurally to handle a mechanic. In the case of party, how do you divide four things among five colors? We ended up using a system where we handled four colors similarly and one differently. This model was never changed and is how the set went to print.</p>
</div>

<p>Each class is thus focused in a non-green two-color pair:</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;">Cleric (white-black)<br />
Rogue (blue-black)<br />
Warrior (red-white)<br />
Wizard (blue-red)</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">You'll notice that four of the six dual lands in this set are these four color combinations.</p>
</div>

<p>We also worked to make each class have mechanics that feel connected to that class. In the current file, Clerics tend to do spells that positively affect you, Rogues do sneaky things that tend to hurt the opponent, often tied to dealing combat damage, Warriors do effects that help increase your ability to win combats, and Wizards tend to do spells that hurt the opponent.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This is a good example of us stating the essence of what we wanted (that each party member had its own mechanical feel) and then giving our first stab at it. This ended up being a bit too prescriptive, and the Set Design team pulled back to a "it's got to flavorfully feel right for the class" restriction. This feel was aided by the creation of Draft archetypes that leaned into each party member. We also chose not to go with watermarks as it's not how we usually use them (to play up factions).</p>
</div>

<p>More so than our individual choices, the most important thing is that if a player looks at the card in isolation, its flavor is evocative of its class. We might want to consider watermarks for the classes.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Because party was one of our major new mechanics, the Vision Design team spent a lot of time exploring different ways it could be executed. The reason we do this is to give the Set Design team a toolbox of execution for the mechanic, so they can create the set. It's understood that usually not every execution will be used.</p>
</div>

<p>There are several different types of party cards:</p>

<p><strong>Party Fillers</strong><br />
These are creature that are of one of the four party classes. In "Diving," 100% of these creatures will be Allies. These cards do not care about your party, they are just members of the party.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">One of the strengths of the party mechanic is that every creature has to have a creature type(s), so it's easy to make most creatures matter for party if we want them to. The one restriction is that it's baked into the card concept, so you have to figure out what cards you want to matter before art is commissioned.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Party Scalers</strong><br />
These are creatures that are both of one of the four classes and have an effect that scales based on the number of members in your party. These effects are always either triggered (most often as an "enters the battlefield" trigger or an attack trigger) or activated. Because the effect is on a creature of the class, it will, at worst, be "set at 1."</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This was the meat and potatoes of the party mechanic. It got used a lot. The fact that it always had at least an effect of 1 was the reason it worked so well.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Party-Scaling Spells</strong><br />
These are like the creatures but appear on spells, meaning they are "set at 0" such that they can at times be useless if you have no relevant classes on the battlefield. These start at uncommon.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">The Set Design team used these as well and did include some at common, but it was used sparingly.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Party Threshold Spells</strong><br />
These are spells that have a boosted effect if you have two or more party members on the battlefield. These mostly show up at uncommon.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This execution didn't end up getting used. Set Design decided that the only threshold they wanted to use was a full party (see below).</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Partycraft</strong><br />
These are a common cycle of instants and sorceries that are one mana cheaper for each member of your party. They all cost four and a color, allowing you to cast them for one mana with a full party.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This execution did end up in the set, but not as cycled as we presented above.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Full-Party Members</strong><br />
These are creatures that have a scaling effect but create a better version of that effect if you have a full party (aka all four relevant creature types). These appear only at rare.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">The set also had these, and they did keep them only at rare.</p>
</div>

<p>The party mechanic was one of the two top-scoring mechanics in our playtest of future mechanics. (The other being the multi-faced lands that I'll talk about next.)</p>

<h2>Modal Double-Faced Cards (MDFCs)</h2>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Vision Design is very good at exploring new design space, tapping into relevant themes, or figuring out how to capture a top-down feel. Power level? Not so much. We way underestimated how good the backsides had to be, given the choice the cards allowed. I just wanted to point out that a Cancel MDFC did exist for a few playtests.</p>
</div>

<p>These cards are a cross between double-faced cards and split cards. They are cards with two different faces, each of which can be played (unlike traditional double-faced cards where you can only play one side and transform to the second side). All three non-Core Standard-legal sets of next year ("Diving," "Equestrian," and "Fencing") will have MDFCs. "Diving's" particular execution will be MDFCs that are always a land on one side.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This take on the modal double-faced cards pretty much stayed true all throughout set design (although they got moved out of common—more on this in a second). I do want to point out that R&amp;D is experimenting with how close we can get to strictly better with the dual lands. We decided that while we do plenty to reward specific basic land types, we do a lot less these days that punish them, so their absence meant something mechanically. Will this impact future dual land design space? I'm not sure. That's why I labeled this as an experiment.</p>
</div>

<p>The lands are always lands that tap for a single mana of one color but do not have the basic land type (to keep them from being strictly better than basic lands). The common and uncommon MDFC cards have lands that enter the battlefield tapped, while rare has some lands that enter tapped and some that enter untapped.</p>

<p>Here are the current cycles in the set:</p>

<p><strong>Common</strong></p>

<p>Land (ETBT)/Instant or Sorcery (These are situational spells that often don't make decks.)</p>

<p>Land (ETBT)/Creature (Creatures for mid- to late game.)</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Both of these cycles exist, but not at common. They got moved up to uncommon. Set Design decided to not do any MDFCs at common, both for complexity at common reasons and as-fan reasons.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Uncommon</strong></p>

<p>Land (ETBT)/Instant or Sorcery (Quirky card designs)</p>

<p>Land (ETBT)/Creature (Anti-color creatures with "hexproof from &lt;color&gt;.")</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">The former cycle still exists, but the latter was cut. Set Design decided to only have one uncommon MDFC with a creature on the front side.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Rare</strong></p>

<p>Land/Land (These are the dual lands, and there are currently all ten two-color combinations.)</p>

<p>Land (ETBT)/Spell (These are Constructed slots with fringe Constructed cards.)</p>

<p>The current plan is for the commons and uncommons to be on one double-faced sheet and rare and mythic rare to be on another. We suggest having at least one slot dedicated to MDFCs.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">The dual lands stayed, but four of them ended up getting moved off to <em>Kaldheim</em>. The latter cycle also stayed. In addition, the Set Design team added a mythic rare cycle that you could pay 3 life to have the lands enter the battlefield untapped. Set Design ended up keeping the same number of cycles Vision Design proposed but moved them around in rarity and changed what a couple did.</p>
</div>

<p>Whether all MDFCs go in that slot or just the commons and uncommons is still to be decided.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">One of the things Set Design has to worry about is how a set will physically be printed. When issues come up during vision design (as happens with any double-faced cards), we'll take a stab at it and pass along our thoughts to Set Design.</p>
</div>

<p>Finally, there are some rules issues still to be worked out. The cards can be cast as either side and exist on the stack and on the battlefield as the chosen side. The outstanding rules issue revolves around what the cards are in other zones.</p>

<p>I lean toward them functioning like split cards where they are both cards, but there are some potential rules issues with this version. Eli and I are working with the digital teams from MTGO and MTGA to figure out if the split card version is possible. The fallback is a double-faced version where there's a dominant side that is what the card is in all other zones. If we go down that path, I would lean toward the dominant side <span class="spoiler">Note from the editor: No really, we removed this text. You can't see it. It isn't ready for you. You may find out soon enough, but now is not the time.</span></p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">MDFCs are a cross between split cards and double-faced cards. It was my hope that we could treat them like split cards, meaning they had the qualities of both sides in every zone other than the stack and the battlefield. I like for Vision Design to aim for the version we'd most like, acknowledge the obstacles in the way, and provide a backup if things don't work out. That's what happened here. The split card version of the rules for MDFCs were very complex and near impossible to program given realistic constraints, so we fell back to the double-faced rules which were already written and programmed. The blacked-out section is me talking about the future. As MDFCs were going to exist in <em>Zendikar Rising</em>, <em>Kaldheim</em>, and <em>Strixhaven</em>, with some variation in execution, we needed to consider all versions of MDFCs when finalizing how MDFCs were going to work.</p>
</div>

<p>I have been working with editing and the project architect to figure out how much information exists on each side about the other side. Things currently seem to be in favor of providing the name and mana cost, and then the card type and power/toughness if it's a creature.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">This plan changed a little because of space issues. We ended up telling you the card type or creature type and the mana cost. For the lands, we told you what color mana they produced. As we do more and more with new frames, Vision Design has gotten involved in doing some preliminary work to understand how they'll look as far as it matters for purposes of function.</p>
</div>

<h2>Landfall</h2>

<p>Landfall is synonymous with Zendikar, so it felt appropriate to bring back. We experimented a little trying new tweaks with it but ended up keeping it as players know it. There are a few cards that create an enchantment-like effect that last until end of turn. I'm not sure if this will read to players as something new though. The thing we discussed with Erik was being able to make cards that felt to be at a power level similar to original <em>Zendikar </em>as opposed to <em>Battle for Zendikar</em>. Erik felt that without fetch lands in the environment, this should be possible.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Set Design didn't end up using the enchantment-like landfall effects. Maybe next visit. Other than that, landfall stayed pretty consistent with the vision we set out.</p>
</div>

<h2>Titan</h2>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Remnant of Force</strong><br />
1U<br />
Instant<br />
Titan 8 (<em>You may cast this spell for its titan cost rather than its mana cost</em>.)<br />
Return target nonland permanent to its owner's hand. If this spell's titan cost was paid, also draw two cards.</p>

<p>The nature of a land-based set is that you tend to play and get more lands onto the battlefield, so we wanted a mechanic that could let you spend the extra mana. (Note that a lot of the MDFC designs also do this.) Titan gives you an alternate generic mana cost, always seven or more, that allows you to cast a "kicked" version of the spell. We liked that the mechanic made a slight, subtle nod to the Eldrazi without us having to have any on the plane. This mechanic is the least intertwined into the structure of the set and could be replaced by a different mechanic that lets you spend extra mana.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">I believe this changed to kicker pretty early in set design. (Usually, if I think there's a good chance of it being removed, I make it less intertwined to make it easier to remove.) The original <em>Zendikar </em>that we were emulating had kicker, and it just gave the Set Design team more flexibility in the kinds of designs they could use. My only sadness in losing titan is that I was hoping to have a more visible nod to the Eldrazi. We purposely didn't want them in the set, but I did want to acknowledge that their presence forever changed Zendikar.</p>
</div>

<h2>Monstrosity</h2>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Cave Lion</strong><br />
W<br />
Creature – Cat<br />
2W: Monstrosity 2<br />
5W: Monstrosity 4<br />
When CARDNAME becomes monstrous, you may destroy target artifact or enchantment.<br />
2/2</p>

<p>Monstrosity was brought back at Erik's request as he and Jenna felt it was a flavor win for top-down "adventure world." Andrew and I spent a little time brainstorming mechanical evolutions for monstrosity. We made two cycles of cards, one with creatures that have monstrosity and one with spells that care about things being monstrous. Each card in the cycle is trying something different to give the Set Design team a sampler of things they could use.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">In vision design, Erik Lauer, the set's lead set designer, expressed an interest in possibly having monstrosity in the set. I had the Vision Design team take a crack at doing something new with it, and the favorite thing we came up with was having two monstrosity costs that allowed you to choose which upgrade you gave it and spells that cared about things being monstrous (I should have included a sample card). This helped fill in some of the mana sinks below seven that titan wasn't hitting. When titan became kicker, monstrosity was removed from the set. I should note that I didn't expect monstrosity to stay, but I wanted to give the Set Design team the best foot forward with it so they could figure out if it added value.</p>
</div>

<h1>Extra Content</h1>

<p>To give the Set Design team some additional material to work with, we designed some bonus content that is not currently in the file but can be added if needed. Here are the things we designed:</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">Part of vision design is exploring possible design space. We frequently create more than can fit in the set. Below were some cool things we made that, while not in the set at handoff, could be added if needed. To go along with my toolbox metaphor above, I think it's helpful when Vision Design hands over a few extra tools that might be handy.</p>
</div>

<h2>New Traps</h2>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Aether Trap</strong><br />
2<br />
Artifact – Trap<br />
At the beginning of your upkeep, sacrifice CARDNAME and draw a card.<br />
Whenever an opponent casts a second spell in a turn, you may put this onto the battlefield and draw a card.<br />
4, or U, T, Sacrifice CARDNAME: Counter target spell.</p>

<p>This is a new take on traps. In original <em>Zendikar</em>, traps were a spell subtype that allowed you to play them cheaper if certain conditions were met. The new traps are artifacts (allowing them to better capture the flavor of a trap) that can be put onto the battlefield for free when a certain condition is met (something done by the opponent) as well as letting you draw a card. The traps then have a turn to be used before they are sacrificed and draw you a card. This allows the controller of the trap to spring the trap (it has two costs, a more expensive generic version or a cheaper colored version allowing anyone to play the trap but letting it be optimized in the right color deck) on the opponent or trade it in a turn later for a card if they don't need to use it. The sacrifice also keeps the player from hard-casting it and having a seal-like artifact sitting over the board. The traps were put into extra content as Erik was not a big fan of them.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">I and a couple other members really liked this new take on traps. They were a little more complicated than the old traps, but the flavor was so good. Erik hated them, though, so there wasn't much of a point in keeping them in the file. I posted it here in the hopes that other members of the Set Design team might like them and convince Erik to change his mind. Obviously, that never happened. Looking back with the distance of time, they are a little clunky.</p>
</div>

<h2>New Quests</h2>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Quest for Forbidden Power</strong><br />
3B<br />
Enchantment<br />
Whenever you complete any of the following tasks, put a quest counter on CARDNAME. If it was the first time you have completed that task, each player discards a card.<br />
* A land enters the battlefield under your control.<br />
* A creature dies.<br />
* An opponent loses 5 or more life in a single turn.<br />
Remove three quest counters from CARDNAME and sacrifice it: Until end of turn, you may play cards from your graveyard. If a card would be put into your graveyard from anywhere this turn, exile that card instead.</p>

<p>Quests are enchantments that ask you to do a series of tasks to receive a reward. The designs are based on the quest designs from "Archery" that got removed during set design. The new quests change a few things. First, instead of having to do each task, the new quests require you to do any combination of tasks up to three times. This means you could do each task once, one task twice and another task once, or one task three times. The quests encourage you to do all three because each time you complete a new task, you get an effect. On all the quests, the first challenge is essentially landfall, which means any quest will eventually be completed in time. The quests ended up getting put into extra content because they were a) wordy and b) most likely required new frames and the new frame space was already being used by the MDFCs.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">When we were making the original quests in <em>Zendikar</em>, we hit upon a different execution where you had to complete three different tasks to get your reward. That version, while flavorful, was wordy and required a new card frame, which wasn't something we were as willing to do back then. <em>Throne of Eldraine </em>took another stab at these quests, but they were too close to adventurer cards and that was the better mechanic for the set. <em>Zendikar Rising </em>vision design picked up the gauntlet (as quests are a natural fit for Zendikar) and came up with a new twist on it, but due to the factors listed above, they were never under serious consideration for inclusion.</p>
</div>

<h2>Levelers</h2>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Leveling Rogue</strong><br />
1B<br />
Creature – Human Ally Rogue<br />
1B: Add a +1/+1 counter to CARDNAME. When CARDNAME gets three +1/+1 counters, it loses this ability and gains menace.<br />
3/1</p>

<p>The levelers were a new take on the leveling creatures from <em>Rise of the Eldrazi</em>. The goal was to make creatures that you can spend mana on to improve but without the complexity and frame needs of the <em>Rise of the Eldrazi </em>levelers. These new levelers have an activated ability that puts +1/+1 counters on them. Then, when they get three +1/+1 counters, it turns the ability off and grants them a creature keyword. This cycle of uncommons got put into extra content because Erik expressed interests in pursuing monstrosity and these were filling the same mechanical space.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">These cards were in the file but got removed when monstrosity got added. I put them here because I knew there was a chance monstrosity would come out. I believe the reason these weren't added in when that happened was because there was enough stuff going on and the set didn't need it.</p>
</div>

<h2>Monster Lands</h2>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Red Monster Land</strong><br />
Land<br />
CARDNAME enters the battlefield tapped.<br />
Whenever one or more creatures you control deal combat damage to a player, put a +1/+1 counter on CARDNAME.<br />
As long as CARDNAME has at least five +1/+1 counters on it, it's a 0/0 Elemental creature with haste and menace.<br />
T: Add R<br />
3, T: Put a +1/+1 counter on CARDNAME</p>

<p>This is a cycle of rare lands. They enter the battlefield tapped and then get a +1/+1 counter when a certain condition is met. Then, when the land gets five or more +1/+1 counters, it becomes a 0/0 creature with haste (to avoid confusion about being able to attack) and a color-relevant creature keyword. These cards got put into the extra content section as they were a little too strong and fought a bit in identity with the creature and land MDFCs. We would like the Set Design team to explore novel ways to do creature lands.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">One of the memorable things about <em>Zendikar </em>was the creature lands (aka the lands that could activate to turn themselves into creatures). The Vision Design team explored different ways we could do this. In the end, the MDFCs ate up most of the land space.</p>
</div>

<h1>In Conclusion</h1>

<p>That's everything to convey about "Diving." The Vision Design team is very proud of what we've created and hope the Set Design team can turn it into an amazing set. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Mark Rosewater</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; text-align: rtecenter; border: 4px solid #4aa7b0; border-radius: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px;">
<p style="margin-left:.1in;margin-right:.1in;">As I mention every time I do one of these, the vision handoff document is just one facet of the communication between Vision Design and Set Design. Usually, I'll come in and talk about the set with the Vision Design team and answer any questions they may have. Also, we always try to have at least one member of the Vision Design team be on the Set Design team to help with continuity of the vision.</p>
</div>

<p>And that is the <em>Zendikar Rising </em>vision design handoff document. I've been getting very positive feedback on these, so I plan to keep posting them in the future. If you have any thoughts on it or possible suggestions for other things you'd like to have me say about them as I annotate, please <a href="mailto:making.magic@hotmail.com">email me</a> or contact me through any of my social media accounts (<a href="https://twitter.com/maro254" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://markrosewater.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Tumblr</a>, <a href="http://instagram.com/mtgmaro" target="_blank">Instagram</a>, and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@markrosewater" target="_blank">TikTok</a>).</p>

<p>Join me next week when I answer your questions about <em>Zendikar Rising</em>.</p>

<p>Until then. May you have fun peeking behind the curtain.</p>

This first class of new pros battled their way through Regional Championship Qualifiers (RCQs) and Regional Championships to reach <em>Magic</em>'s biggest stage. And with that first class in our new system hitting the Pro Tour, we've incorporated some of their feedback—and the feedback of players who participated in RCQs around the world—into our next season.</p>

<p>One of the biggest issues that prevented players from participating in multiple RCQs was the difficulty in maintaining multiple decks across multiple formats and staying up to date in those formats. Originally, we left it up to the local stores to determine their RCQ formats—they know their players best, after all.</p>

<p>However, what ended up happening was that players who would have otherwise wanted to attend multiple events in their area largely didn't when the formats were different. So, if a player had the time and interest to attend two events but one was Pioneer and the other was Modern, they may not have been able to maintain two decks and the format knowledge necessary to compete, often picking one and skipping the other.</p>

<p>We also heard from content creators that people who wanted to create content around the RCQ season had difficulty doing so because three different Constructed formats were difficult to cover effectively. While we're making these changes for RCQ participants first, it's a strong bonus reason that it helps people making competitive-focused content.</p>

<p>Therefore, starting with Season 2, Round 1, of the Regional Championship Qualifiers (April–August), we'll be requiring in-store RCQs to run either Pioneer Constructed or the current Limited format. Certain larger events will still be able to provide RCQ support as part of other events.</p>

<p>To give stores some flexibility and support our Limited fans, Limited will remain an option with the designated Constructed format for all RCQ rounds.</p>

<p>Additionally, for the 2023–2024 season, Regional Championships will also match the Constructed format of the corresponding RCQ rounds. This is not necessarily the case for the corresponding Pro Tours, and we'll announce those formats later.</p>

<p>Our goal is to unify the competitive playing community during this time and lower the barrier for players to play in multiple events. We are constantly looking to tweak and improve our <a href="https://magic.gg/pro-tour" target="_blank">path to the Pro Tour</a>. Here's Director of Play Programs Billy Jensen talking more about the change.</p>

<iframe width="850" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jedseuxEvxk" title="" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>

<h2>RCQ Promos</h2>

<p>And a new Regional Championship Qualifiers round means new promos!</p>

<p>The qualifying round for the Regional Championships that feed into Pro Tour 4 will start April 22, 2023, and will run until August 20, 2023. During that time, participating WPN stores and approved organizers will host Regional Championship Qualifiers that award invitations to the Regional Championship(s) within their respective region. Those Regional Championship events will take place in the late September to late November 2023 timeframe and award invitations to Pro Tour 4 in the first part of 2024. Additionally, based on feedback from the last season, we're slightly extending the qualifying round lengths so that stores have a little more time to plan when their event takes place.</p>

<p>You'll also notice a difference with this round. In the same fashion as the announced Pro Tour and <em>Secret Lair</em> Showdown cards that are making their debut at MagicCon: Philadelphia, RCQ and Regional Championship promos are making their debut in the <em>Secret Lair</em> Prize Card category! Supported by our friends on the <em>Secret Lair</em> team, these special promo cards will give the competitive <em>Magic </em>community an opportunity to obtain prize cards featuring a wider range of art styles.</p>

<p>While supplies last, this round of RCQs will, like with the other rounds, award promos for participation as well as for top-finishing players. The promos will once again be getting a refresh for this round and will feature brand-new, never-before-seen art and our popular borderless treatment.</p>

<p>The April 22–August 20, 2023, Regional Championship Qualifier promo cards are as follows*:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Unholy Heat: Non-foil versions are available by participating in local qualifiers. Traditional foil versions are available as well through participating in larger open qualifying events as well as side events at Regional Championships. This version of Unholy Heat features new artwork from Cabrol.</li>
</ul>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Non-Foil Unholy Heat" src="https://media.wizards.com/2023/images/daily/en_727HDYwbe2.png" style="width: 265px; height: 370px;" /> <img alt="Traditional Foil Unholy Heat" src="https://media.wizards.com/2023/images/daily/en_87NFewuE3E.png" style="width: 265px; height: 370px;" /></p>

<ul>
	<li>Eldritch Evolution: Non-foil versions of this card can be earned by being a top finisher in local qualifiers. Traditional foil versions will be available to players who earn invitations to their respective Regional Championship at qualifier events.

<div style="text-align: center;">

  </div>

<p>We're celebrating the release of <em>Magic</em>'s newest set on <em>MTG Arena</em> with a look back at the awesome details and data we know about the set from last week's <em>Phyrexia: All Will Be One </em>Early Access event. With hundreds of players battling in thousands of games across Standard, Sealed, and Draft—all using the latest cards from <em>Phyrexia: All Will Be One—</em>anyone looking to get started with the new release has their head start right here.</p>
<p>Let's get to the numbers.</p>
<h2><em>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</em> Draft and Sealed Download</h2>
<p>One of the fastest ways to collect the newest cards on <em>MTG Arena</em> is by playing Limited—that is, jumping to a Draft or Sealed event and opening new packs. Whether you want to rise to Mythic ranking in <a href="https://magic.gg/events/ranked-play-season" target="_blank">the monthly ranked season</a> or solve the puzzle that every Sealed pool of cards presents, knowing what might be a good strategy is where you start.</p>
<p>While we're not going to draft and build your deck, we can share which colors found more success during Early Access. These are the top five colors by win rate for Draft and Sealed (with more than 100 matches played).</p>

When we set out with our updated Premier Play system last year, our hopes were to give all <em>Magic</em> players an opportunity to play <em>Magic</em> at the highest level and to give <em>MTG Arena</em> players a spotlight on the biggest stages of <em>Magic</em>. So far, we have been excited and inspired by <em>MTG Arena </em>Premier Play. We will continue to work toward these goals as we grow our competitive paths.</p>

<h2>Recap of <em>MTG Arena </em>Premier Play in 2022</h2>
<p>Back in April of last year, we announced <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/mtg-arena/mtg-arena-premier-play-in-2022" target="_blank"><em>MTG Arena </em>Premier Play in 2022</a>, which brought new events called Qualifier Play-Ins and Arena Championships (alongside our existing Qualifier Weekends and Arena Opens) to a path that looks like this:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
 <img alt="MTG Arena Premier Play paths showing progression through Qualifier Play-Ins, Qualifier Weekends, the Arena Championship, and paths into tabletop competitive Pro Tours and the Magic World Championship" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/pU38snweyD.jpg" />
 </div>
 <p>Throughout 2022, we ran nine Best-of-One (Bo1) and eight Best-of-Three (Bo3) Qualifier Play-Ins (one each month from May through December, plus an extra Bo1 Play-In). We had twelve Qualifier Weekends, one each month, and we held our first Arena Championship in September, which had a total of $200,000 in prizes.</p>
<p>To complement the Premier Play path, we also ran Arena Opens throughout the entirety of 2022 in which players could earn invitations to Qualifier Weekends and were awarded more than $2,000,000!</p>
<h2><em>MTG Arena</em> Premier Play in 2023</h2>
<p>This brings us to <em>MTG Arena </em>Premier Play in 2023, where we will continue to have monthly Qualifier Play-Ins and Qualifier Weekends, will be running three 32-player Arena Championships (each with $200,000 in prizing), and plan to have another ten Arena Opens. All of the Arena Opens will be Limited formats. Qualifier Play-Ins and Qualifier Weekends will continue to be a mix of Constructed and Limited formats.</p>
<h3>Qualifier Play-Ins</h3>
<div style="text-align: center;">
 <a href="https://www.magic.gg/events/qualifier-play-in" target="_blank"><img alt="Qualifier Play-In logo" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/logo_play-in_blue_850.jpg" /></a>
 </div>
<p><a href="https://www.magic.gg/events/qualifier-play-in" target="_blank">Bo1 and Bo3 Qualifier Play-Ins</a> are the best entrances into Premier Play for players looking to skip the monthly ranked ladder, and they will continue to be a mix of Constructed and Limited events. Complete the win track in either event to earn that month's Qualifier Weekend token, which grants entry into that month's Qualifier Weekend.</p>
<p>The following is the Play-In schedule for the next three months (Bo1 // Bo3):</p>
<ul>
<li>February 18 // February 24: <em>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</em> Limited</li>
<li>March 4 // March 10: Standard</li>
<li>April 1 // April 7: Explorer</li>
</ul>
<p>We will continue with Play-Ins throughout the rest of the year! Stay tuned for more dates and information.</p>
<h3>Qualifier Weekends</h3>
<div style="text-align: center;">
 <a href="https://magic.gg/events/qualifier-weekend" target="_blank"><img alt="Qualifier Weekend logo" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/logo_qualifier_weekend_blue_850.png" /></a>
 </div>
<p>Immediately following the Play-Ins and in the same formats, <a href="https://magic.gg/events/qualifier-weekend" target="_blank">monthly Qualifier Weekends</a> gather <em>Magic</em> players from the ranked ladder, Arena Opens, and Qualifier Play-Ins to participate in a weekend-long event.</p>
<ul>
<li>February 25–26: <em>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</em> Limited</li>
<li>March 11–12: Standard</li>
<li>April 8–9: Explorer</li>
</ul>
<p>Complete the win track on Day One of Qualifier Weekend to compete in Day Two, where the top prize is a seat at the corresponding Arena Championship! Like last year, if we don't fill all 32 seats of that Arena Championship this way, players with the most Day Two Qualifier Weekend wins will earn the remaining spots. Check out <a href="https://www.magic.gg/standings/arena-championship-2" target="_blank">the previous leaderboards</a>.</p>
<p>Qualifier Weekends feed into each Arena Championship:</p>
<ul>
<li>September–December 2022 Qualifier Weekends =&gt; Arena Championship 2</li>
<li>January–April 2023 Qualifier Weekends =&gt; Arena Championship 3</li>
<li>May–August 2023 Qualifier Weekends =&gt; Arena Championship 4</li>
</ul>
<h3>Arena Championships</h3>
<div style="text-align: center;">
 <a href="https://magic.gg/events/arena-championship-2" target="_blank"><img alt="Arena Championship logo" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/logo_arena_championship_blue_850.jpg" /></a>
 </div>
<p>These are the pinnacle of competition in <em>MTG Arena</em>. There will be three <a href="https://magic.gg/events/arena-championship-2" target="_blank">Arena Championships</a> with 32 players each over the course of 2023. Players will compete for their share of a $200,000 prize pool, and each winner and runner-up of an Arena Championship will earn a seat at the <em>Magic </em>World Championship.</p>
<p>Upcoming Arena Championship schedule:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arena Championship 2: March 18–19</li>
<li>Arena Championship 3: May (Date TBD)</li>
<li>Arena Championship 4: September/October (Date TBD)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Arena Opens</h3>
<div style="text-align: center;">
 <img alt="Arena Open with Planeswalker symbol and prize dollar signs" src="https://media.wizards.com/2023/images/daily/hero_arena_open_2.jpg" />
 </div>
<p>Throughout 2023, all Arena Opens will be Limited events (Bo1 and Bo3 Sealed on Day 1 and a two-part draft on Day 2). Arena Opens are the height of open competition in <em>MTG Arena</em>—show up, sign up, and sling spells to compete for the $2,000 top prize. In 2022, we awarded over 1,000 players a total of more than $2,000,000!</p>
<p>Furthermore, earning monetary rewards during Day 2 of an Arena Open will also earn entry into the Qualifier Weekend that follows it. We will have ten Arena Opens throughout the course of 2023 for players to join, with the next few months' schedule as follows:</p>
<ul>
 <li>March 3–4</li>
<li>April 1–2</li>
<li>April 29–30</li>
</ul>
<p>So, there you have it for now! In short, we are continuing to build out and grow our <em>MTG Arena</em> Premier Play systems, and to celebrate our first full year with the updated competitive path.

I'd gotten some feedback that my stories tend to focus on the higher rarity cards, so I wrote only about common cards in Part 1. Today, I'll tell some more card design stories but while addressing a different note from readers. I've been spending a lot of time showing the evolution of each card's design, and I got some feedback that people liked when I told stories that gave larger historical context for cards, so today's column is going to take that approach.</p>

<p><h2>The Compleated Planeswalkers</h2></p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img src="https://media.wizards.com/2023/one/en_b42628a03a.png" style="width: 265px; height: 370px;" /> <img src="https://media.wizards.com/2023/one/en_80b2b1b967.png" style="width: 265px; height: 370px;" /> <img src="https://media.wizards.com/2023/one/en_ea864f6cdf.png" style="width: 265px; height: 370px;" /></p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img src="https://media.wizards.com/2023/one/en_d3095c961a.png" style="width: 265px; height: 370px;" /> <img src="https://media.wizards.com/2023/one/en_191f540645.png" style="width: 265px; height: 370px;" /></p>

<p>Planeswalkers first came about because Matt Cavotta swung by my desk to say, "I have an idea." Matt was on the <em>Future Sight</em> design team and at the time was part of the Creative team. They were working on the story for the <em>Time Spiral</em> block, an event called the Mending, which was created to allow us to power down the Planeswalkers as it was hard to relate to characters with godlike powers. Matt felt that we were doing so much to support having Planeswalkers that we should make them a card type.</p>

<p>I agreed, and we set out to see if we could make one. First, the <em>Future Sight</em> team worked on it with the idea that we'd have three of them on the futureshifted sheet, but it was clear by the time design ended that we weren't close enough. We decided to take the time to do it right and put them in whatever set made sense. We did, though, hint at them in the reminder text for Tarmogoyf.</p>

<p>I then put together and led a Planeswalker mini team. The team's earliest version was the design that we later adapted for Sagas. Eventually, we settled on a design, and planeswalker cards were introduced in <em>Lorwyn</em>.</p>

<p>I realized that planeswalker cards had a limited design space, so I was careful to have us slowly roll out additions to it. For instance, I didn't allow them to have static abilities (save some double-faced card shenanigans) until <em>War of the Spark</em>. This story begins when I was leading the vision design for <em>Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty</em>.</p>

<p>We'd outlined the Phyrexian storyline, and we knew Tamiyo was going to be Phyrexianized in <em>Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty</em>, Ajani in <em>Dominaria United</em>, and five other Planeswalkers (that hadn't been nailed down yet) in <em>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</em>. I was assigned the task of figuring out what it meant to be a Phyrexianized planeswalker card.</p>

<p>My first idea—the one I was most excited by—was Phyrexian loyalty, which let you spend life in place of loyalty. Play Design told me that this was inherently broken. I ended up producing a document that suggested five other possible ways to do it, each with several tweaks. For the first time ever, here were my five suggestions, along with my sub-suggestions:</p>

<h4>Suggestion #1: Make Use of Poison</h4>

<p>The Phyrexians are associated with poison, so I designed a bunch of versions that used poison as a restriction.</p>

<ul>
	<li>All loyalty abilities grant you poison.</li>
	<li>Some abilities, mostly plus loyalty abilities, grant you poison.</li>
	<li>Forced proliferate grants a little poison.</li>
	<li>Loyalty abilities that can grant you poison if you choose to push them.</li>
	<li>Loyalty abilities that sometimes grant you poison (based on certain things happening).</li>
	<li>Granting poison as a static ability to stop you from keeping them for long.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Suggestion #2: Make Use of Life Loss</h4>

<p>In <em>Scars of Mirrodin</em> block, we associated the Phyrexians with life loss, so that was another theme we explored. Most of the themes were the same ones we tried with poison.</p>

<h4>Suggestion #3: Make Use of Sacrifice</h4>

<p>Sacrifice was another Phyrexian theme in <em>Scars of Mirrodin</em> block, so we also experimented with using that as a cost. Again, structured similarly to how we did poison.</p>

<h4>Suggestion #4: Make Use of Proliferate</h4>

<p>Proliferate (along with poison and Phyrexian mana, the three P's of Phyrexia) was strongly associated the Phyrexians, so we explored this as a theme.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Every planeswalker has +0: Proliferate.</li>
	<li>Every planeswalker references a kind of counter, and proliferate is on at least one ability.</li>
	<li>Proliferate forces you to proliferate your own poison counter; some could come with one.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Suggestion #5: Make Use of the Library as a Resource</h4>

<p>The library is not as associated with the Phyrexians, but it was a resource that you tend to have more of, so it gave us additional flexibility in costing. All these versions exiled cards from your library and usually gave you some way to use some of them.</p>

<p>All these ideas were explored, but in the end, none of them were used. Instead, they found a version that let them use Phyrexian mana by adding an additional cost (giving up loyalty). I like to use this as a good example of how some ideas require a lot of time and attention to find the proper answer. I am happy with how they ended up.</p>

<p><h2>The Mites</h2></p>

<p>When <em>Alpha</em> came out, the internet was young. The World Wide Web was just gaining ground, and most talk online was through a thing called the Usenet (kind of like a bulletin board). In addition, Richard Garfield's original vision was that players would discover what cards existed through playing with other people. As part of this in the early years, Wizards of the Coast did not publicly print card lists or show decklists from events. This meant that what was most popular in <em>Alpha </em>early on were cards that just excited people, regardless of their power level, as most players didn't yet have the skills to judge what was strong and there were no public expert opinions.</p>

<p>There was one card I really wanted, but no one would trade it away, so the only way to get one was to open it in a booster (which I excitedly did). What was that card? Take a guess and then click below to see the answer.</p>

	<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="The Hive" src="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=43&type=card" /></p>

	<p>Yes, believe it or not, one of the hottest cards in the early days of <em>Magic</em> was The Hive. My best guess as to why is that this was a top-down design and the use of creature tokens was the only way Richard could think to make it. The reason I think players were drawn to it is that creature tokens are cool. Plus, it was one card capable of making many creatures, something no other <em>Alpha</em> card could do. Richard would make two more cards that made creature tokens in <em>Arabian Nights</em> (<auto-card>Rukh Egg</auto-card> and <auto-card>Bottle of Suleiman</auto-card>), and the ball just started rolling from there. Creature tokens became evergreen.</p>

	<p><em>Fallen Empires</em> was the first set to use creature tokens as part of a larger mechanical theme, of which Saprolings were a part (a creature type that to this day we only make on creature tokens). There were so many tokens and counters in the set that Wizards of the Coast made a punch-out sheet with all of them and put it into an issue of <em>The Duelist</em> (<em>Magic</em>'s magazine from back in the day).</p>

	<p><em>Apocalypse</em> made the penumbra mechanic (unnamed) where several green creatures created black creature tokens of their size when they died. <em>Odyssey</em> block made extensive use of creature tokens to make flashback spells that functioned a lot like creatures. <em>Onslaught</em> made a handful of symbiotic creatures that died into a number of 1/1 tokens equal to their power/toughness (all square).</p>

	<p>Creature tokens started becoming a larger mechanical theme that we could tie into. For example, the mono-green theme in the original <em>Ravnica </em>(each color had a theme that overlapped its two colors) was token making. <em>Unglued </em>introduced creature token cards, and they started showing up in boosters by <em>Tenth Edition</em>.</p>

	<p>In <em>Rise of the Eldrazi</em>, we were trying to make "battlecruiser <em>Magic</em>" where giant creatures could fight each other on the battlefield. To pull this off, we needed a way to help ramp mana while helping you cast your Eldrazi and not just any spell.</p>

	<p>One of the answers to this problem was to design a creature token with a special function. These became Eldrazi Spawn tokens, which had the ability "Sacrifice this creature: Add &lt;&gt;." The idea of making unique creature tokens to support a set theme became another tool in our design toolbox. <em>Battle for Zendikar</em> had Eldrazi Scion tokens. <em>Strixhaven: School of Mages</em> had Pest tokens.</p>

	<p>However, we noticed a problem with our desire to make creature tokens as larger themes. Tokens gummed up the board, making them more efficient defensively than offensively. <em>Theros Beyond Death</em> had 1/1 red Satyr tokens, and we found that they were causing problems, so the solution was to give all Satyr tokens "can't block." This helped focus them as being an offensive threat. We encountered a similar issue when making the Zombie tokens for <em>Innistrad: Midnight Hunt</em>. We gave them "can't block" and created a new decayed mechanic that required players to sacrifice them at the end of combat after attacking.</p>

	<p>This brings us to <em>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</em>. We wanted white to have a swarm poison strategy, but there simply weren't enough 1/1 creatures. Creature tokens were the solution to that problem because they allow one card to generate more than one creature. They obviously needed toxic 1, as they were core to a poison strategy, but we weren't sure at first whether they needed "can't block." After all, wasn't toxic enough of an incentive to save your creature for an attack?</p>

	<p>So, we had a playtest to see if that would hold true, and it didn't. Using your 1/1 token creatures as a disincentive for your opponent attacking and chump blocking big attackers just proved to be too efficient, so we added on "can't block."</p>

	<p>We then looked for various ways to create a number of Mite creature tokens, like when a creature enters the battlefield or dies. It could be after an attack trigger or an upkeep trigger, or by using spells that made more than one. In combination, they did exactly what we wanted and gave white an amazing tool to allow a very specific kind of threat, one I hope you all get to experience firsthand on your side of the table.</p>

<p><h2>The Myr</h2></p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img src="https://media.wizards.com/2023/one/en_440bb7a7fc.png" style="width: 265px; height: 370px;" /> <img src="https://media.wizards.com/2023/one/en_11e879baac.png" style="width: 265px; height: 370px;" /></p>

<p>When I started designing original <em>Mirrodin</em>, one of the first things I created was the cycle of mana Myrs (<auto-card>Gold Myr</auto-card>, <auto-card>Silver Myr</auto-card>, <auto-card>Leaden Myr</auto-card>, <auto-card>Iron Myr</auto-card>, and <auto-card>Copper Myr</auto-card>). I liked the idea that on this artifact-themed plane, the common mana stones would be on creatures. This allowed me to make them at two mana, as being creatures would give them extra vulnerability.</p>

<p>For their creature type, I chose Gnome. Why Gnomes? Gnomes had oddly become an artifact creature type and were used on a bunch of small artifact creatures in the early years of <em>Magic</em>, and the public, myself included, found them endearing.</p>

<p>Then one day, Brady Dommermuth came to visit me. Brady would later go on to become the creative director of the Creative team, but this was before that happened. Here, with a bunch of dramatic license, was our conversation:</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;"><strong>Brady</strong>: Gnomes?!<br />
<strong>Me</strong>: What about them?<br />
<strong>Brady</strong>: You have Gnomes in the set?<br />
<strong>Me</strong>: Yes.<br />
<strong>Brady</strong>: Why?<br />
<strong>Me</strong>: Because they're adorable, and players like them.<br />
<strong>Brady</strong>: So, when this artificial plane was created, someone said, "You know what we need? Gnomes."<br />
<strong>Me</strong>: I take you don't like it being Gnomes.<br />
<strong>Brady</strong>: It just doesn't make any sense from a story perspective. Why do you want it to be Gnomes?<br />
<strong>Me</strong>: I just wanted a little softness, something players could find lovable.<br />
<strong>Brady</strong>: Okay, what if I make a brand-new artifact creature that's lovable? Something new to this plane. Would that be okay?<br />
<strong>Me</strong>: Sure.</p>

<p>Brady then went away and came back a month or so later with the earliest design of the Myrs. I believe they were influenced by the Myrmidons from Greek mythology, so Brady called them Myrs. (It rhymes with "deer.") I thought they were great. So much so that we added a bunch more to the file.<em> Mirrodin </em>came out, and Myrs were a huge hit.</p>

<p>After <em>Mirrodin </em>block was done, the Myrs went away as they're specifically from Mirrodin. The next time one would appear would be <auto-card>Sarcomite Myr</auto-card> in <em>Future Sight</em>. It was one of the futureshifted cards that showed potential futures of <em>Magic</em>.</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Sarcomite Myr" src="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=136212&type=card" /></p>

<p>The card was meant as a big hint of what was going to happen when we returned to Mirrodin. We had subtly set up the Phyrexian invasion in our first visit (for example, Memnarch literally encounters a strange oil in the beginning of the book), and <auto-card>Sarcomite Myr</auto-card> was a hint of what was coming. Interestingly, it's the first monocolor artifact, as I expected to make use of monocolor artifacts as a main mechanical theme when we returned, but the idea ended up getting used first on the shard of Esper in <em>Shards of Alara</em> block.</p>

<p>The Myr returned in <em>Scars of Mirrodin</em> block. Like many of the denizens of Mirrodin, we watched some of them fall to the Phyrexians. A few showed up in <em>Modern Horizons 2</em> on cards set on New Phyrexia. Which brings us to <em>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</em>.</p>

<p>We were returning to New Phyrexia, formerly Mirrodin, the only plane where the Myrs exist, so we knew we wanted some new ones. The set had a lot going on, so in the end, there was only room for three in the main set and one in a Commander deck. We did make sure the Commander card was a Myr build-around with a five-color identity. All four Myrs were made colorless, with only one being a Phyrexian. We wanted to show that while many Myrs had fallen to the Phyrexians, not all of them had.</p>

<p>We tied the one Phyrexian Myr, Myr Convert, to the toxic mechanic with a second ability that was a throwback to the original mana Myr cycle, although with a life payment to make it feel more Phyrexian. Myr Custodian was made to help with deck smoothing, something all decks could use. Myr Kinsmith was made to interact with Myrs, giving it a little utility in Limited but a much more powerful effect in larger formats where you have access to more Myrs.</p>

<p>Looking back, I'm so glad Brady steered me away from making Gnomes.</p>

<p>The story of the Spheres begins with the design of <em>Return to Ravnica</em> back in 2012. We were going back to Ravnica, so we went back and looked at the original <em>Ravnica</em> to figure out what we could improve upon. The number-one answer was the color fixing. Ravnica had been revolutionary in many ways, but it came up short because it was often hard to play three-color decks, something the <em>Ravnica</em> block encouraged, especially in Draft when you added the second and third sets of the block.</p>

<p>We decided that we wanted it (and <em>Gatecrash</em>) to have a cycle of common dual lands and a cycle of rare dual lands. The best option for the common dual lands were the tap lands (dual lands that enter the battlefield tapped; they first appeared in <em>Invasion </em>block), and the best option for the rare dual lands were the shock lands (dual lands that enter the battlefield tapped unless you pay 2 life; they first appeared in the original <em>Ravnica</em> block). The problem was that the rare duals were "strictly better" than the common lands—that is, they did what the common dual lands did, but with a bonus. We're fine making strictly better cycles, but we tend to avoid making them in the same set.</p>

<p>This raised the question: could we tweak the tap lands? They were a bit on the weak side, so we had room to add some additional ability. What did that ability want to be? Also, could it be something that felt like it specifically belonged in Ravnica?</p>

<p>The answer came from the Creative team. They'd been building out the plane, as we do on returns, and came up with a concept of each guild having a gate. It was going to play a role in the larger story. What if we flavored each dual land as a Gate?</p>

<p>The next question: how do we make them different mechanically. We explored a lot of options but landed on the idea of doing a land subtype. In the beginning, land subtypes were just the five basic land subtypes, but over time, we started making more use of them. They began appearing on card type lines in <em>Eighth Edition</em> to solve some rules issues. We also went back on things like the Urzatron to use subtypes to help the cards mechanically function. We used them sporadically but usually to make cards work individually and not simply as a marker (although Desert retroactively became one).</p>

<p>The plan was to have the common dual lands be subtype Gate and have a handful of cards that cared about Gates so the cards would have some extra functionality. This was a bit controversial at the time, but it seemed like the cleanest execution, so we got everyone on board. Gates went on to be a success.</p>

<p>Flash forward to <em>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</em> design. New Phyrexia, in trying to reflect old Phyrexia, created nine spheres. It was an important story point, so we wanted to reflect it in the set if possible. That raised the question: how exactly do we communicate that New Phyrexia has nine Spheres? Yeah, we could mention it in flavor text or a card title, but neither of those seemed grand enough. The solution was to borrow the same trick we used with Gates.</p>

<p>Phyrexia has nine lands representing the nine Spheres of the plane. We then had one card, Monument to Perfection, mechanically reference them. Five of them became part of a common cycle that was used to add some card flow in the late game. Each one represented one of the five colors. This was done by looking at the nine available Spheres and picking the one that felt like it captured the aspect of one of the five colors most. The remaining four were then designed top down and put at rare.</p>

    <p>
      <img style="magic" />Welcome to the first <i>Theros</i> Preview Week! I
      finally get to talk about the design of <i>Theros</i>. I was very proud
      when I handed off this set sixteen months ago and the fact that I've had
      to wait so long to be able to talk about it with all of you has been
      torture. Gladly, today is the day where I get to share with you the origin
      story of one of my favorite sets I've ever designed. And don't worry, I
      have a saucy preview card to show off as well.
    </p>
    <ul>
      In The Beginning
    </ul>
    <p>
      Our story begins many years ago in
      <a
        href="http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Archive.aspx?author=Aaron%20Forsythe"
        >Aaron Forsythe</a
      >'s office. Aaron had tasked me with putting together the next six-year
      plan. Previously (<a
        href="http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/mm/224"
        >you can read about it here</a
      >), my former boss,
      <a
        href="http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Archive.aspx?author=Randy%20Buehler"
        >Randy Buehler</a
      >, had asked me to put together a five-year plan and I had so many ideas I
      liked that I turned it into a six-year plan. Following suit, when Aaron
      asked for a six-year plan, I showed up in his office with a seven-year
      plan.

        >Sam Burley</a

    </p>
    <p>
      Also in the room was
      <a
        href="http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Archive.aspx?author=Brady%20Dommermuth"
        >Brady Dommermuth</a
      >, who was at the time the creative director for <b>Magic</b> (aka the
      head of the creative team). Brady and I worked hand in hand on many sets.
      Together, we made the world of Mirrodin and created the guilds of Ravnica
      (I wanted ten two-color pairs and Brady turned that idea into the guilds I
      then based <i>Ravnica</i> block around, mechanically), as well as many
      other things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyway, I was in Aaron's office with Aaron and Brady and it was time for
      me to start pitching my seven-year plan. Year one was <i>Innistrad</i>.
      That had already been designed (when I made the six-year plan, I had
      Gothic horror as penciled in for year seven) and was in development. Year
      two was <i>Return to Ravnica</i>. That was in design at the time and we'd
      known we were returning to Ravnica seven years earlier after the first
      <i>Ravnica</i> block was a giant hit. Year three was really the first new
      block I was presenting.
    </p>
    <p>
      My idea for the third year was something I'd wanted to do for a long time.
      It took me a few years to actually figure out how to best do it, but I had
      an epiphany and discovered the key to how I wanted to make it happen. This
      pitch was me selling the idea to Aaron and Brady. A thumbs up from them
      meant it would become a reality. Aaron liked the pitch and said it sounded
      good. Then Brady spoke up. "I like the idea, Mark," he said, "But I don't
      think the creative team has the resources to pull it off."
    </p>
    <p>
      I continued with my pitch and the rest of the four ideas all seemed
      acceptable to Aaron and Brady (a few were switched around and there was
      some tweaks but those are stories for future years). We then came back to
      year three. I explained that I didn't think Brady was giving my idea a
      fair shake. Yeah, there were issues, but I felt we could work them out.
      Brady held firm saying that a good idea isn't enough. It has to be a good
      idea we can execute. And with that, my block idea was rejected.
    </p>
    <p>Here is the conversation (with my normal liberties) that followed:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p class="mvtext">
        <b>Aaron:</b> Okay, so we like everything but the block that's scheduled
        to start design in two months.<br /><b>Me:</b> I put it first because I
        thought it was my best idea. We're following up
        <i>Return to Ravnica</i>. That's a tough act to follow.<br /><b
          >Brady:</b
        >
        Maybe we should look at some of the ideas we keep talking about doing.
        For example, we've said for years we should do a Greek mythology set.<br /><b
          >Me:</b
        >
        It's tricky. <b>Magic</b> has so much Greek mythology in it already that
        we have to find a way to make it feel special.<br /><b>Brady:</b> Greek
        mythology had a lot to do with dreams and the dream state. Maybe there's
        a way to work an enchantment theme into it. I know players have been
        asking for an enchantment block.<br /><b>Aaron:</b> A Greek mythology
        set with an enchantment theme. That sounds like something the players
        would like. Do you think you could make something like that work,
        Mark?<br /><b>Me:</b> Give me a week to think about it.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
      A Band of Heroes
    </ul>
    <p>
      This seems like a good break in the story to introduce <i>Theros</i>'
      design team.
    </p>
    <p><b>Mark Rosewater (lead designer)</b></p>

    />
    <p>
      Aaron and I decided that, at least for the near future, I'm going to be
      leading the design for all the first sets in a block. As I led the design
      for three out of the last four first sets, this really isn't too much of a
      change of status quo. As head designer, it helps if I'm always shaping the
      large expansion that sets the tone for the block.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I appear constantly in design team bios and I have this column and my
      podcast and my blog and even a daily comic strip that's occasionally
      biographical, I'm not sure what else to say that you haven't heard
      numerous times. How about this: I'll tell a quick story about my youth and
      Greek mythology. It doesn't really have anything to do with the design but
      at least it's a new story and it's tied into the set's theme and you'll
      learn a little bit about me.
    </p>
    <p>
      In ninth grade, we studied Greek mythology in school. It was pretty easy
      for me because as a kid I had a habit of choosing a topic and then reading
      every book I could find about it. Greek and Roman mythology had been one
      such topic. One day we had a test. One question asked what Ares/Mars was
      god of and there were two blanks. War was the obvious answer. For the
      second blank, I put warriors as I knew that many soldiers prayed to
      Ares/Mars and considered them to be their primary god. My teacher marked
      the second answer wrong. I went to see her because I was confused. I had
      read many books about warriors praying to Ares/Mars. When I asked her what
      we were supposed to put on the second line, she said we had only learned
      that Ares/Mars was the god of war. We were supposed to leave it blank.
    </p>
    <p>
      My job occasionally requires me dealing with a lot of frustration. I like
      to think of incidents like this as training.
    </p>
    <p><b>Ethan Fleischer</b></p>
    <img
      align="right"
      src="http://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/mm/mm263_ethan.jpg"
    />
    <p>
      One of the things I started doing on all my sets is to choose a core
      designer (i.e., one of the people designated as a <b>Magic</b> designer
      reporting to
      <a
        href="http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Archive.aspx?author=Mark%20Gottlieb"
        >Mark Gottlieb</a
      >
      and myself) to serve as my second. That person is in charge of maintaining
      the card file. I have found that one of the best ways to teach is to have
      a designer control the file on a design team where he or she is not yet
      the lead designer. This helps the designer learn the process in a hands-on
      way.
      <a
        href="http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Archive.aspx?author=Ethan%20Fleischer"
        >Ethan</a
      >
      was my second (development uses the term "strong second") on the
      <i>Theros</i> design team.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to that role, I also gave Ethan an additional project to work
      on before the design began. I asked him to do a research project (in-depth
      research is one of Ethan's strengths) on Greek mythology and look for
      opportunities both with things <b>Magic</b> has done in the past and for
      things that it hasn't. If this sounds interesting, please go check out
      <a
        href="http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/263"
        >the feature article</a
      >
      where Ethan talks about this assignment.
    </p>
    <p>
      A third reason I wanted Ethan on the team was that I had tagged him as the
      lead designer for <i>Journey Into Nyx</i>, the third set in the block, and
      I wanted him to be on both design teams leading up to it to make sure he
      was as familiar as possible with the world and the block he'd be working
      in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethan is a great designer and I am always happy to have him on one of my
      design teams. Having the additional role as the Greek mythology expert
      (okay, one of two—I'll get to the other in a second), made him extremely
      valuable to <i>Theros</i>'s design.
    </p>
    <p><b>Ken Nagle</b></p>
    <img
      align="right"
      src="http://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/mm/mm263_ken.jpg"
    />
    <p>
      One of the things we tend to do is to make sure that the lead designer of
      the next set is familiar with the block, so we always put him or her on
      the set prior to the one he or she is going to be leading. As
      <a
        href="http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Archive.aspx?author=Ken%20nagle"
        >Ken</a
      >
      was the lead designer for <i>Born of the Gods</i>, that meant he needed to
      be on the <i>Theros</i> design team.
    </p>
    <p>
      What's crazy to me is that Ken is now the most-experienced designer on my
      team (obviously other than myself). It seems like just yesterday I was
      having meetings with the judges during the first
      <a
        href="https://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtgcom/designersearch/home"
        >Great Designer Search</a
      >, where the others kept wanting to eliminate Ken and I would say, "No, I
      see a lot of potential." Turns out I was right. Ken has matured into an
      excellent designer (is that better than great?).
    </p>
    <p><b>Zac Hill</b></p>
    <img

      src="http://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/mm/mm263_zac.jpg"
    />
    <p>
      Every design team has a development representative (what we tend to call a
      "dev rep"), which is a spot always filled by one of the core developers.
      <a
        href="http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/archive.aspx?author=Zac%20Hill"
        >Zac</a
      >
      was one of my favorite dev reps because (a) he was good at always asking
      development-oriented questions that tended to help lead the design to good
      places, (b) he would always design a lot of cards, and (c) he was fun to
      have on a team. (You spend a lot of hours with your design team in
      meetings. Having a group that is fun to hang with is important.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Zac has since left Wizards to go on to do other things and I miss him
      already. Luckily, he still does coverage for the Pro Tours, so I get to
      run into him every once in a while. <i>Theros</i> had a smooth handoff to
      development and part of that goes to Zak's role on the team. (The other
      part goes to
      <a
        href="http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/archive.aspx?author=Erik%20Lauer"
        >Erik Lauer</a
      >, <i>Theros</i>'s lead developer, who asks great questions of the design
      team even when not on it.)

      creative-team representative. Jenna was in charge of card concepting for
      the set (deciding what each card represents, flavorwise) and was
      well-positioned to make sure that our top-down design was melding the
      needs of both design and creative.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jenna was our other expert on Greek mythology and she and Ethan would
      often go on about what did and did not fit into Greek mythology or what
      obscure thing we could squeeze in at higher rarities for the Greek
      mythology fans. On top of all that, Jenna also designed some very
      flavorful cards.

      he get design credit? Because he's responsible for one of the mechanics in
      the set, and a very central one at that. I'll be talking about it and its
      creation next week. Billy is a developer, but one with a lot of design
      skills, so he always brought designs with a different sensibility. In
      fact, <i>Theros</i> had a major problem to solve, which Billy's mechanic
      was key to solving. Billy is

      to do other things and he is going to be missed. It's not often we have
      someone with strong skills in both development and design.

      So that was the team that brought top-down Greek mythology to life. I'll
      pick up the story where I was trying to figure out whether or not a block
      dedicated to Greek mythology with an enchantment theme was a good idea.
      (The above was a little foreshadowing: it obviously was.)

      Aaron had given me a week to think through Brady's idea. A Greek-mythology
      top-down world with an enchantment theme. Could I make it work?

    </p>
    <p>
      The idea of a Greek mythology set had been around since the beginning of
      <b>Magic</b>. <i>Arabian Nights</i> did Persian mythology (straight-up,
      not a world inspired by it). Surely <b>Magic</b> could handle Greek
      mythology. After all, Greek mythology was all over the game. That ended up
      being the sticking point. Greek mythology had minotaurs and pegasuses and
      centaurs and griffins and hydras and sphinxes and cyclopes and on and on.
      (By the way, I know a few of the creatures I just named actually were
      unique in Greek mythology, meaning there was exactly one of them, but a
      trading card game doesn't do well with just one of a creature type.) The
      problem was all those things were also already a part of <b>Magic</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      For years, the concern was that a Greek mythology set wouldn't have enough
      of an identity because so much of what Richard had built into the game
      came from Greek mythological roots. And then came <i>Innistrad</i>.
      <i>Innistrad</i> was about Gothic horror, but what we found was that the
      majority of what we used were creatures <b>Magic</b> normally uses. Four
      out of the five tribes in the set, for example, were <b>Magic</b> staples,
      and even the fifth, Werewolves, had been used in <b>Magic</b> before, if
      only on a handful of cards.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lesson of <i>Innistrad</i> was that you can make up a set of things
      <b>Magic</b> normally does but they can be grouped and flavored to create
      a feel that is distinct from normal <b>Magic</b>. So I wasn't actually
      worried that we couldn't make a Greek mythology world have its own feel.
      In fact, I knew that not only could we but it wouldn't even be that hard.
      What I was thinking about was not <i>if</i>, but <i>how</i>. How could I
      make such a block feel right yet have a fun play pattern?
    </p>
    <p>
      Layered on top of that was Brady's suggestion of an enchantment theme.
      <b>Magic</b> had only once before done an enchantment block and it got
      totally overshadowed by the power level of the sets in it. (I'm talking
      about <i>Urza's Saga</i> block for those unaware.) To top it off, the
      brand team at the time decided to call the block the "Artifact Cycle," so
      any hope of people recognizing the enchantment theme was out the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      I really wanted to do an enchantment block but the key was that I wanted
      to find a way to do it that was different from the several other
      "card-type matters" blocks we've done. So, both Greek mythology and
      enchantments excited me, but each required some hook, something that would
      allow us to do something unique. Well, I had a week to figure out how.
    </p>
    <ul>
      Some Enchanted Evening
    </ul>
    <p>
      When Brady had first suggested the idea of enchantments, he said that
      there was a strong tie between Greek mythology and dreams. The gods often
      came to people in their dreams and there was definitely a dream-like
      quality to how the gods functioned. One could even argue that the Greeks
      formed a lot of their ideas on how the Greek gods behaved based on how
      they saw them in their own dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      Often, when I'm trying to solve one puzzle, I'll instead answer a
      different one. While thinking about the role of enchantments in
      <i>Theros</i>, I thought about this card:
    </p>
    <card align="center" name="Lucent Liminid"></card><br />
    <p>
      The biggest challenge of <i>Future Sight</i> design was designing the
      future-shifted cards that showed cards from <b>Magic</b>'s potential
      future. A lot of what we did was to pick extensions of things
      <b>Magic</b> already did but in a way that we hadn't done yet.
      <b>Magic</b> had artifact creatures since the game's beginning, so I
      figured one day we'd do an enchantment creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that the original version of
      <a
        href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lucent+Liminid"
        class="autocard-link"

      had a static enchantment-like ability.
      <a
        href="http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/archive.aspx?author=Mike%20Turian"
        >Mike Turian</a
      >, <i>Future Sight</i>'s lead developer, removed it because the set had
      too much complexity and he was looking for ways to simplify it. (Yes, the
      set was at one point even more complex.) I fought with Mike because I felt
      the card didn't make any sense if it didn't have an enchantment part. It
      was just a creature, not an enchantment, and I felt strongly that an
      enchantment creature needed to feel like both. (This will become important
      in part two of our story.) Obviously, I lost that fight.

      was released, I've always had it in the back of my head that I wanted to
      find a way to make enchantment creatures work, but that meant I had to
      find a reason for them. I didn't want them being enchantments just
      because. I wanted it to be a key component of their design and flavor. The
      enchantment part had to matter both mechanically and flavorfully. It was a
      problem that I had stuck away until such a time that the answer presented
      itself. Apparently, this was that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      What if the enchantment creatures were the creation of the gods? This
      would give them a not-quite-real quality that would help make the
      enchantment play a role in the card. It also led to a few other ideas that
      I will get to next week, as I explain one of the new mechanics tied to the
      enchantment creatures. Note that this idea of the enchantment creatures
      being creations of the gods would later tie them into Nyx, which was the
      home of the gods created by the creative team.
    </p>
    <p>
      The more I thought about this idea, the more excited I got. It would allow
      us to create a world similar to Greek mythology but it would be something
      with our own spin on it. Also, using enchantment creatures as the backbone
      for an enchantment block would allow us to solve one of the biggest
      sticking points of an enchantment block—how would black and red deal with
      the theme?
    </p>
    <p>
      I went to Aaron the next day and told him I was in. I said, "Let's do a
      Greek mythology block."
    </p>
    <ul>
      "Myth. Myth."
    </ul>
    <p>
      It was at this point that I asked Ethan to start doing research on Greek
      mythology. Note that this was still seven weeks before the design was
      scheduled to begin. I checked in with him each week as he was collecting
      lists of ideas. Greek mythology played well to <b>Magic</b>'s wheelhouse.
      It had good visuals, good creatures, good locations. It had everything a
      <b>Magic</b> set wants.

    <p>
      Then one day I was at the library with my kids. I was helping my youngest
      daughter Sarah find some books when I stumbled upon a book about Greek
      mythology for kids. I don't remember the name of the book but the subtitle
      was, "Gods, Heroes, and Monsters." I took the book home because I figured
      a kids' book was the perfect thing to point out what was the most resonant
      qualities of Greek mythology. That book, and its subtitle, would prove to
      be very important to the design.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first day of <i>Theros</i> design, I started with the exact same
      exercise I had done on the first day of <i>Innistrad</i> design (I used
      <i>Innistrad</i> design as an inspiration for <i>Theros</i> as the two
      were both top-down, flavor-driven sets): I asked my team to brainstorm
      everything they could think of having to do with Greek mythology.
    </p>
    <p>
      A quick aside. When I say Greek mythology, I really mean Greek and Roman
      mythology. During all the early parts of design, I assumed we would use
      inspirations from both. The creative team asked early on if we could focus
      just on Greek mythology because they felt that there were enough
      differences between Greek and Roman culture that we might be able to save
      Roman for a future set (not necessarily a Roman mythology set, but one
      around Roman culture—gladiators, chariots, and such).
    </p>
    <p>
      The team filled every inch of the board. Greek mythology was pretty deep.
      As we looked it over, I noticed that the things tended to fall into a few
      sections. The biggest was creatures—mostly monsters. The second was gods
      or things tied into the gods. The third was things connected to stories of
      myth, most of which dealt with heroes. The last was things tied into
      actual Greece, mostly having to do with clothing, weapons, and
      architecture. When I removed the historical Greek things, I noticed we had
      three groups—gods, heroes, and monsters. That, I decided, was going to be
      our inspiration.
    </p>
    <ul>
      Oh Gods
    </ul>
    <p>
      I came into our second meeting and said, "I've come to a conclusion. If
      we're going to do Greek mythology and do it correctly, then there's no way
      to do it without gods. The very center of Greek mythology is the pantheon
      of the gods. If we're going to do our version, it too has to have a
      collection of gods. Not only that, but if we do a pantheon of gods, then
      it has to tie into the center of <b>Magic</b> and that's the color wheel."

      I laid out my plan. We would have fifteen gods. Five monocolored gods that
      would be the major gods and ten two-colored gods that would serve as the
      minor gods. The colors would help give each god an identity that would tie
      the pantheon of gods to <b>Magic</b>. The design team loved the idea so I
      took it to the creative team. Brady gave me the thumbs up and we were good
      to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      For those now wondering, the five major gods are in <i>Theros</i>. The ten
      minor gods will show up in <i>Born of the Gods</i> and
      <i>Journey Into Nyx</i>. The creative team did a great job of figuring out
      the different facets of the Greek gods and mixing and matching them to
      create <i>Theros</i>'s gods, which had both a feel of Greek mythology and
      <b>Magic</b>'s color wheel. Remember that the gods are not straight-up
      duplicates of the Greek gods but rather different components stitched
      together as dictated by the color philosophies. Also, not every choice
      made was the most obvious one, as the creative team came up with some
      pretty cool new ideas for gods.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm running out of time for today, so you're going to have to wait until
      next week for how the design team chose to execute gods, heroes, and
      monsters. I am not going to leave you completely hanging, though, as
      I have a god to show off<

      <p>
        This is Heliod. His art was the one we showed off when the name of
        <i>Theros</i> was first announced. Heliod is the god of the sun and the
        embodiment of white. He lays down the rules and doesn't take kindly to
        anyone who disobeys him. (Note the spear in his hand. That's his
        favorite choice for smiting.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Before I get to show off his card, let me explain one mechanic to you.
        It is called devotion, and in this block it always refers to a color.
        Heliod, for example, cares about devotion to white. Devotion is a
        tweaked version of the
        <a
          href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoileramp;method=visualamp;action=advancedamp;set=+%5B%22Eventide%22%5Damp;text=+%5Bchroma%5D"

          >teased originally in <i>Future Sight</i></a
        >). Next week, I'll explain why we chose to bring it back. The important
        thing to know now is that you figure out your devotion to a color by
        adding up the mana symbols of that color in the mana cost of permanents
        you control on the battlefield. (Chroma looked in different zones to
        count mana symbols in mana costs while devotion only looks on the
        battlefield.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, if you're wondering about his frame, it's different because he's
        an enchantment creature and all enchantment creatures have the new
        frame. (Each color has its own version.)
      </p>
      <p>With that out of the way, let's meet Heliod.</p>

    <p>
      I'm sure you have a lot of questions about how we ended up making the gods
      as we did. Luckily for you, you can join me next week when, I talk about
      that in part two, along with how we captured the feeling of the heroes and
      the monsters.

    <p>Until then, may the gods be on your side... of the battlefield.</p>

  <li>We've lowered the price on our <strong><a href="#playbundle">Play Bundle</strong></a> and focused on Limited play value through Draft and Sealed tokens.</li>
  <li>We're introducing the <strong><a href="#passbundle">Pass Bundle</a></strong> at the lowest price point of the three, which includes the <em>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</em> Mastery Pass, a pre-order pet, and themed cosmetics for broader audience value.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Feel like more than one of these is a good fit for you? Purchase two, or all three bundles—whatever is right for you! Our goal is to explore options that are affordable and that match our players' styles and objectives.

<p>When the Phyrexians invaded Mirrodin, they fell under the influence of the plane's colored suns. The mana from the white sun gave birth to Elesh Norn. She adopted and twisted the societies and beliefs of those she conquered into her Phyrexian faction, the Machine Orthodoxy. She preaches a vision of grand unity where no creature is separated from the other by such pitiful, mortal barriers as skin or flesh.</p>

<p>At first, Norn believed she was the divine speaker for Karn, the planeswalking golem who brought Phyrexians to Mirrodin. As their creator, he was revered as a god. But he proved to be mortal, flawed, and betrayed the Phyrexian cause. This convinced Norn that she must become her people's new leader, and she dubbed herself the Mother of Machines. To shepherd in a new age of Phyrexian glory, she has orchestrated a plan to unite the Multiverse.</p>

<p>Unctus was once a vedalken known as Kiryk. A prominent researcher and member of the governing synod, he chose to investigate a mysterious oil seeping up from Mirrodin's ground. His experiments turned into obsession, and he injected himself with the ichor. From then on, his dreams were tainted with visions of Phyrexia, and he worked to achieve its goals. He compleated himself, his fellow vedalkens, and their human Neurok rivals. From their parts, he built his greatest: the Meldweb, a living network of vedalken and Neurok brains that would serve as an all-powerful reservoir of knowledge.</p>

<p>Mirrodin's necrogen-infested Mephidross served as a home for the plane's vampires. Of those vampires, only the most skilled assassins were granted a seat in the Bleak Coven. When the Coven's leader, Vraan, discovered the power of Phyrexianization, he and his followers welcomed it with open arms. After accepting compleation, they turned their cutthroat ways to the new social hierarchy, and Vraan murdered his way into the Seven Steel Thanes. They say he collects the heads and memories of his victims for his Crypt of Keepsakes.</p>

<p>Before Phyrexia invaded Mirrodin, Geth was a Moriok human who controlled his realm with armies of zombified nim. However, his thirst for power led to his demise, and his body was reduced to just his head. Determined to reclaim his power, Geth aided the Phyrexian invaders in exchange for a new, more powerful body and the title of Steel Thane. But unlike the other thanes, who prefer violent subjugation, Geth uses backhanded, binding magical contracts to enslave his subjects. The other thanes thus view him as weak and ridicule his human origins.</p>

<p>Slobad was a goblin inventor and would-be hero who sacrificed his newfound Planeswalker spark to save the people of Mirrodin. Many thought him dead when he was trampled into the earth, but his broken body sank into the plane's core—where Phyrexia waited. Holding onto hope that he would see his friend Glissa again, Slobad reluctantly accepted as the Phyrexian oil reshaped his body. Finally mended, he emerged with the understanding that Glissa, too, had the honor of joining Phyrexia. Still influenced by the memories of his previous life, Slobad modified his Phyrexian body to resemble his late friend, the golem Bosh. Slobad now toils for the compleation of the Multiverse, convinced that Phyrexia has reunited him with his friends.</p>

<p>Jin-Gitaxias crafted Malcator from the first loxodon he captured in the Phyrexian invasion. The creature was so strong, so intelligent, so close to perfection. With a few minor adjustments, Jin-Gitaxias built the ideal candidate to lead the most powerful of his research sectives. Malcator's discerning eyes would overlook what the other sectives produced, making sure their creations passed the Standards of Purity. And those that did not would be reinvented—by any means necessary—until they, too, were perfect.</p>

<p>When the artificer Venser arrived on New Phyrexia, what he saw horrified him so much that he gave up his Planeswalker spark to prevent the glistening oil from spreading throughout the rest of the Multiverse. However, his sacrifice was in vain, and Phyrexia still took over Mirrodin. Venser's soul perished alongside his spark, but Phyrexians are never ones to waste good material. The inventor's corpse was unearthed by Sheoldred's troops and woven into the fabric of a new goliath who serves Sheoldred in her war against Elesh Norn.</p>

<p>Ria Ivor was an Auriok, one of the first Mirran inhabitants to encounter the Phyrexians. She stood on the front line of the invasion, ready to defend her homeland and live up to her title as the Champion of Bladehold. She fought them for as long as she could, but her heroism would eventually become her undoing. On a mission to rescue a besieged leonin settlement, her party was ambushed, and she gave her life to ensure the survivors could escape. Now, she has been turned into the enemy she once feared.</p>

<p>The heroic elf Glissa saved Mirrodin from the destruction at the hands of Memnarch, but her adventure ended in tragedy, and she retreated underground. While she slept, Phyrexian oil seeped into the plane's core and infected her buried body. Vorinclex, Praetor of the Vicious Swarm, awakened her newly compleated form to serve as his speaker. Now she patrols the Hunter Maze as its most powerful, cold-blooded warrior, shepherding in the Grand Evolution by culling the weak until only the strong remain.</p>

<p>Mirrodin was meant to be a perfect, metallic plane, but even such a shining plane could never be free of vermin. The rats that arrived here bred, and after their invasion of Phyrexia, they bred more. And more. And more, until they turned in upon themselves, devouring each other to form a greater whole. Their skeletons, flesh, and screeching voices united into one choir that called itself Karumonix. Their new, unified hive mind can now sense and manipulate their rodent brethren anywhere in New Phyrexia.</p>

<p>Urabrask knew he would need allies in his rebellion against Elesh Norn, and ruthless Sheoldred was the obvious choice. As a gesture of goodwill, these allies worked together to create a new Phyrexian general to lead their united front. Kethek is a merciless goliath who uses the flamethrowers built into her body to melt her enemies into slag.

<p>When the Phyrexians changed the surface of Mirrodin, they found themselves changing as well. Migloz participated in the construction of New Phyrexia, designed to drill holes into the plane's surface. But upon the compleation of his sphere, he found a strange ambition blossom inside him. So, he did what he did best—tunnel. He drilled through the floor of his Furnace Layer birthplace and emerged in the Hunter Maze. Fascinated by the new environment of twisting, oxidized copper, he adapted and made it his new home. Now he roams both spheres, using his massive arms to leap and swing from structure to structure.</p>

<p>When Phyrexia reshaped the surface of Mirrodin, parts of the very land took on a mind of its own. Entire mountains began to move, becoming godlike Phyrexian creatures known as the Domini. Mondrak was born from the spires of the Fair Basilica. She grew dozens of mouths whose keening wail compels living things to assimilate into Phyrexia. She is an awe-inspiring but brain-melting sight.</p>

Zopandrel came from the Hunter Maze. She is a majestic, horned being with scythe-like limbs who patrols with the uncaring cruelty of an apex predator.

<p>Unlike the Domini who emerged from the construction of the Phyrexian spheres, Ovika was born from the remains of Mirrodin after it had been ravaged for building material by the Phyrexian troops.

<p>Mirrodin's levelers were giant, merciless creatures created by Memnarch to wreak terror across the plane at his behest. When he was deposed, they were left to wander the land, confused and leaderless. Although many were captured and absorbed into New Phyrexia, Graaz remains and still wanders the surface of Mirrex, tearing through everything in its path with the same ferocity as if Memnarch never left.</p>

<p>Elesh Norn created Atraxa and bequeathed upon her a sacred duty. While Norn turned her conquering eye to the Multiverse, Atraxa would have the honor of bringing the other spheres of New Phyrexia into the fold. Atraxa knew if she were to do this, she would need a lieutenant of her own. Taking inspiration from Elesh Norn­, Atraxa created Ixhel in her image and commanded Ixhel to go forth and subdue the other praetors.</p>

<p>As each realm fell, Ixhel grew more and more intelligent. Determined to honor her creators, she gathered the broken bodies of her Phyrexian foes, following in her forebears' footsteps and crafting an unlife of her own. She cobbled together the poisonous Vishgraz from pieces from multiple factions, but the limbs and bones seemed to be at war with themselves within the creature's very body. Ixhel's beautiful child was branded an abomination by the Machine Orthodoxy that raised them both.</p>

<p>This stung Ixhel to the core. But as she has matured, so has her understanding of Phyrexia, and perhaps she has begun to call into question the doctrine that raised her.</p>

<p><strong>Vishgraz, the Doomhive</strong></p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Vishgraz is an abomination even by Phyrexian standards, a monstrosity cobbled together from the organic and inorganic components of compleated warriors from across the plane—most notably Geth, one of the Seven Steel Thanes. He was meant to be Ixhel's glorious first creation, just as Atraxa created her. Instead, his creation was labeled an act of heresy, and he was sentenced to death.</p>

<p>Rather than destroy her creation, Ixhel chose to set Vishgraz free in the Dross Pits. He lurks there still, learning about the world into which he was brought—and taming the writhing swarm of venomous creatures that have come to follow him.</p>

<p><strong>Neyali, Suns' Vanguard</strong></p>

<p>Prior to the Phyrexian invasion, Neyali lived in the Oxidda Chain as part of the Tribe of the Helm. She trained native birds to deliver messages between Vulshok tribes. One day, she found a glowing egg that seemed abandoned by its parent, so she took it to raise. But then, the Phyrexians attacked her village!</p>

<p>Neyali and her egg were the only survivors of the massacre. She wandered the ruins of Mirrex for weeks, looking for signs of life. She told herself she had to keep going, to protect this egg that was all that remained of her home. Just when she thought she might be safe, she found herself surrounded by Phyrexian centurions. But right before she collapsed, her dedication was rewarded. Her egg cracked, birthing a phoenix that burned with the very fire of resistance.</p>

<p>The phoenix, Otharri, burned the Phyrexian aggressors to ashes to save Neyali and lead her to Slagmaw, a Mirran resistance camp. The rebels used hexgold to craft special falconer's gloves for Neyali, giving her and her birds matching powers to pound and crush their shared enemy. Since then, her flock has vastly expanded, and phoenixes have become a symbol of hope for a restored Mirrodin.</p>

<p><strong>Otharri, Suns' Glory</strong></p>

</div>

<p>Neyali collected a mysterious egg in the Oxidda Chain. When her Vulshok village was decimated by Phyrexians, she took the egg with her. The fiery phoenix Otharri hatched during this escape, and he vowed to protect his guardian, Neyali, with his very life. He burned every Phyrexian that approached the pair on their quest to Slagmaw, the Mirran resistance camp that would become their new home.</p>

<p>When the Mirrans saw them, they welcomed Otharri with open arms. He lent his magical fire as a tool to help the rebels forge stronger weapons, including a pair of magical, crushing falconer's gloves for Neyali. His determination and power have become a rallying symbol of hope for all Mirrans.</p>

<p>Chiss-Goria is one of the few remaining dragons from the original Mirrodin. He is so powerful that he has escaped Phyrexianization by simply destroying any that have attempted to go near him. Mirrans craft armor and weapons from the scales he sheds. Seeing him is considered a good omen that they will win the next battle.</p>

</div>

<p>Urtet was a Myr servant who collected metal for Mirrodin's first ruler, Memnarch. Even with Memnarch gone, Urtet is determined to continue his purpose and sleeplessly scavenges Mirrex for anything of value. He can always be found carrying an assortment of tools, and he often leaves collections of useful items in his wake. These valuable little troves have made him an inadvertent yet important ally to the Mirran survivors.</p>

</div>

<p>The vampire assassins that make up Vraan's Bleak Coven are silent and deadly killers who use their fangs and claws tear their victims to shreds. But Kinzu's ambition was always larger than what she could kill with her own two hands. Never satisfied by felling targets one by one, she found a way to make phyresis work to her advantage. She infects the minds and bodies of her victims with the glistening oil, turning them into murderous puppets that kill for her and perpetuate her vicious goals.</p>

<p>Rhuk is a goblin armorer who perfected the art of hexgold forging and created many of the best weapons that the Mirran resistance ever wielded. He knows just how rare and valuable the phyresis-preventing material is, and he is determined to never let the resistance's primary strategic advantage fall into Phyrexian hands. No matter the risk, he will arm himself to the teeth and dive into enemy territory to take back any and all stolen equipment.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Phyrexia: All Will Be One Jumpstart Booster Themes and Card Lists</title><link>https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/phyrexia-all-will-be-one-jumpstart-booster-themes-and-card-lists</link><guid>https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/phyrexia-all-will-be-one-jumpstart-booster-themes-and-card-lists</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>When the Phyrexians show up on a plane's doorstep, as a rule, it doesn't bode well for the residents.

It will fall to Kari and Jace to create the opening the renegades need.</em></p><hr><div class='figure-wrapper'><figure><img alt='Art by Jason Rainville' src='http://media.wizards.com/2016/images/daily/c4rd4r7_uYnUQ1Qu9j.jpg'><figcaption><a href='https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kari+Zev%27s+Expertise' class='autocard-link' data-image-url='https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Kari+Zev%27s+Expertise'>Kari Zev's Expertise</a> |Art by <a href='http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&amp;method=visual&amp;action=advanced&amp;artist=+%5bJason%5d+%5bRainville%5d' target='_blank'>Jason Rainville</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>Though she was only fifteen, Kari Zev had been at the pirating trade long enough to have seen her share of strange things. Sometimes she'd go to strange places and meet strange people, while at other times strangeness came to her. Perhaps that's just what it was to be pirate. Kari couldn't say for sure, but whatever it was, Kari had always been quick to recognize the strange as a wonderful source of opportunity.</p><p>And that's how the notorious young pirate captain found herself aboard a Consulate aether-collecting skyship, smuggling canisters of their inventory onto her ship under the approving gaze of Consulate stooges, all the while consulting the voice in her head.</p><p>Of course, the Consulate saw none of that, at least not in that way. What they observed was an allied Consulate vessel, with a loyal Consulate crew, who'd come to them on official Consulate business to requisition aether for the Consulate cause.</p><div class='figure-wrapper'><figure><img alt='Art by Christine Choi' src='http://media.wizards.com/2016/images/daily/c4rd4r7_bDFXJEmaom.jpg'><figcaption><a href='https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aethersphere+Harvester' class='autocard-link' data-image-url='https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Aethersphere+Harvester'>Aethersphere Harvester</a> | Art by <a href='http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&amp;method=visual&amp;action=advanced&amp;artist=+%5bChristine%5d+%5bChoi%5d' target='_blank'>Christine Choi</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>"<em>It's quite a trick, Jace. I can't believe it's working. This is the last crate</em>," she thought, though it still felt odd to think <em>at</em> someone. But then, what was typical about this job?</p><p>She bent her knees, pressed her cheek against the filigreed side panel of the crate, and lifted her end of it. Through gritted teeth, she let out a sharp abbreviated breath as the load rose off the deck's polished surface, and as the weight of the crate was bit into her fingers, Jace's voice bloomed in her head.</p><p>"<em>Let's just get this done. I'd advise against any more theatrics, though.</em>"</p><p>"<em>Theatrics?</em>" She was shuffling backward as she conversed in her mind, trusting in her crate-partner to guide their way across the gangplank that spanned the open space between this ship and hers. "<em>What theatrics? As a loyal Consulate captain, I simply shared my feelings about the filthy renegades.</em>"</p><p>"<em>The illusions that mask you, your crew, and your ship are only visual. All I'm saying is don't give them reason to be suspicious. There's a guard to your left. He's not pleased about this exchange.</em>"</p><p>Kari didn't have to look to know that the guard was watching her, but of course she did anyway. He was a lanky officer of some rank, with rounded shoulders and gray at his temples. Kari nodded at him as they stepped onto the gangplank.</p><p>"<em>He's following you across</em>," came Jace's thoughts once more.</p><p>"<em>Excellent</em>," she thought, "<em>I have a lot more to say.</em>"</p><p>"<em>I can tell that you're joking, you know.</em>"</p><p>"<em>You're still sweating about it, though, aren't you?</em>" Kari teased.</p><p>At last they were back aboard her ship, <em>Dragon's Smile</em>, though it looked more like a Consulate-commissioned cloud cutter, and even she couldn't see through Jace's illusion. Hopefully, neither could this officer, who came around to her as she and her partner lowered the crate to the deck.</p><p>Kari rubbed her sore fingers, and turned to the officer, who stood a full head taller than her. "Can I help you with something?" He was looking around the ship, and he was doing so in a way that seemed like he wanted her to know that he was looking for something.</p><p>"<em>He's a lieutenant</em>," Jace telepathically fed her.</p><p>"Lieutenant," she said, and again, "can I help you with something?"</p><p>The officer tilted his head down and met her gaze. He started to say something, but his words were lost as a screech from above cut across them, and he leapt back as though to avoid an attack. "A monkey!" he said, looking up. A second screech sounded.</p><div class='figure-wrapper'><figure><img alt='Art by Daniel Ljunggren' src='http://media.wizards.com/2016/images/daily/c4rd4r7_omA5fwjnlh.jpg'><figcaption>Art by <a href='http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&amp;method=visual&amp;action=advanced&amp;artist=+%5bDaniel%5d+%5bLjunggren%5d' target='_blank'>Daniel Ljunggren</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>"Yep," confirmed Kari. "Someone's got to run this ship."</p><p>Clearly relieved, the sailor let out a nervous chuckle, and Kari couldn't resist. "What's funny?" she said in all seriousness. A long moment followed where the officer's smile slowly faded until he was standing there shifting his gaze awkwardly from the monkey to Kari, and back again. Kari's face remained humorless, and she was savoring every bit of this.</p><p>"I'm just having fun with you, Lieutenant," she said, hooking a thumb beneath the sash of rank that hung across her torso, and giving it a good flick. "This here's my ship."</p><p>His head cocked to one side, and his brow furrowed. "I'm sorry, you seem quite young to be a captain."</p><p>Kari put on her best no-nonsense expression. "Son, there are two possible realities here. Either I <em>am</em> too young, and therefore not a captain. Or," she flicked the sash of rank again, "I am, in fact, a captain, and you are questioning my authority. Now then, which reality do you suppose is a safer one for you to believe in? Perhaps there's a reason you're still a lieutenant. Think on that."</p><p>"Apologies, Captain. I meant no offense."</p><p>Kari reached up and brushed off the officer's shoulder. It took everything she had not to laugh. "I know. If you meant to offend me, well, then you'd discover a whole other kind of reality. Now go on." She turned her back to them, and barked an order at no one in particular, " Make ready to shove off! The renegade filth must pay!"</p><p>When the lieutenant departed, Kari had the gangplank hauled in. Soon, the space between the ships began to widen as Kari's pulled away. When she deemed the distance to be sufficient, she thought at Jace, "<em>You can drop the trick now. We're well enough away.</em>" And before she could finish articulating her thoughts into words, her Consulate uniform dissipated, along with the Consulate trappings on her ship. She was no long Kari Zev, Consulate blah, but instead, she was back to being Kari Zev, pirate captain. "<em>Impressive, Jace. Truly. Now meet me on deck if you want to see our score.</em>"</p><p>As she waited for the hooded man, she paced the deck of her ship. Even though it was never truly gone, she was glad to have it back. While it wasn't her first ship, it was beautiful, with its up-swept bow that had earned it its name. She loved it. More than that, she loved it up here. It was fresher, and freer, and it was hers.</p><p>Off to starboard, Kari spotted a pod of skywhales that swam through a swirling aether current no more than a couple leagues away. There were perhaps a dozen of the magnificent creatures following the flow of aether across the sky. Young were among them, darting between their mammoth elders with a heedlessness that made Kari smile.</p><p>"You shouldn't have done that back there," said Jace when he joined Kari at the crates, and it took her a moment to adjust to the sound of his voice being spoken aloud. "It was an unnecessary risk to tear into that officer. You knew that to be true."</p><p>"A risk? Yeah, I suppose. But I'd never be able to forgive myself otherwise." Her hand swept from the direction from which they had flown toward the pile of lifted cargo behind her. "You understand that, right?"</p><p>"I'm not entirely sure I do," Jace replied, but Kari already wasn't listening. The begoggled monkey, Ragavan, was watching this exchange from atop the heap of crates, and Kari whistled him over.</p><p>"Come, Ragavan, prince of mine, let's have a look inside, shall we?" Kari worked at the latch, and when it slid away it was the white-furred monkey who hoisted the lid. With a smile, Kari welcomed the familiar blue glow that washed over them.</p><div class='figure-wrapper'><figure><img alt='Art by Sara Winters' src='http://media.wizards.com/2016/images/daily/RSqX8ePVNw.jpg'><figcaption>Art by <a href='http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&amp;method=visual&amp;action=advanced&amp;artist=+%5bSara%5d+%5bWinters%5d' target='_blank'>Sara Winters</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>She reached inside and extracted the cylindrical form of an aether canister. The light it emitted came from a glass window set into the middle of its metal casing, and Kari gazed at the swirling gaseous contents within. Then, from over her shoulder, Jace's face appeared.</p><p>"Were you expecting something other than aether?"</p><p>"Nope. Just appreciating the moment. You should too. After all, your illusion won us all this," she said, passing the canister over to Jace, who took it with obvious curiosity. Then she boomed the command, "Let's get this cargo secured! Bring it below."</p><p>After a moment, the platform in the center of the deck began to sink into the cargo hold in the belly of <em>Dragon's Smile</em>. As it moved, Kari lifted herself onto one of the other crates, and sat at its edge so that her legs dangled.</p><div class='figure-wrapper'><figure><img alt='Art by Brad Rigney' src='http://media.wizards.com/2016/images/daily/c4rd4r7_O6VKGEMUaz.jpg'><figcaption><a href='https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kari+Zev%2C+Skyship+Raider' class='autocard-link' data-image-url='https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Kari+Zev%2C+Skyship+Raider'>Kari Zev, Skyship Raider</a> | Art by <a href='http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&amp;method=visual&amp;action=advanced&amp;artist=+%5bBrad%5d+%5bRigney%5d' target='_blank'>Brad Rigney</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>Addressing Jace, who didn't even seem to notice to descent, she said, "You know, when I was aboard my first ship, <em>Sun Chaser</em>, my captain used to tell me all the time that the main thing that makes a great pirate is instinct for finding and seizing opportunity. If you can't do that, my captain said, you're just a thief with a boat." She paused. "What I mean is, when all this business with the Consulate and the Grand Consul is over, you could come with us. A person of your talents could be pretty useful."</p><p>No response. Perhaps he hadn't heard her. The platform shuddered into place in the narrow hold below deck.</p><p>Kari was about to repeat the question, but stopped. Instead, she just watched him turn the cylinder over in hands, as though he was inspecting it for some hidden meaning that was sealed away within. It was just aether, but he was utterly engrossed.</p><p>Then at last, Jace said, "I'm sorry, did you say something?"</p><p>Never mind, she thought. Instead, she said, "You're not the pirating type, are you?"</p><p>The canister stopped moving in Jace's hands. He smiled. "No? What type do I strike you as?"</p><p>"Well," Kari leaned forward, elbows on her knees, and gave Jace a squinting look. "Not the pirating type, anyway."</p><p>"I suppose not. But what does that entail, the pirating type? How did you come to enjoy this lifestyle?"</p><p>"How does anyone come to do anything?" Kari shrugged. "All I know is that I couldn't imagine doing anything else. Whatever it takes to keep this ship flying, I'll do it. And all this aether," she pounded a fist on the lid of the crate she was using as a chair, "is going to fetch enough to see that skies remain open to me for at least a little while."</p><p>Jace set the canister back in its place like it was suddenly contaminated. "You intend to <em>sell</em> this aether to the renegades? Let's be clear, I went with you because I thought you could help turn the tide in all this. I can lend a hand with your errands; just know that I'm here for Tezzeret.</p><p>It was little too accusatory for Kari's liking. Especially aboard her own ship. "Look, Jace, Pia and I are pretty close. She's like a second mom to me. But she knows me well enough to understand that I don't fight for freedom, and I certainly don't fight for free. I'll raid for the renegade cause because it's the right thing to do, but the truth of it is this ship, let alone a fleet, doesn't stay in the sky all by itself." She pounded her fist again. "That's the pirating type!"</p><p>Her face was growing hot, and she was aware that the volume of her voice had risen sharply over last few seconds. She took a breath. "Look, just before dawn tomorrow, I'll be arranging the drop with one of Pia's associates. You should come."</p><hr><p>They were called the aviaries. Kari had explained to Jace it was the collective term for the cluster of hangars perched on the rooftops of some of the tallest buildings in Ghirapur. It's where she used to visit as a small child to watch skyships come and go all day. The whole thing was a tangle of catwalks and stairways that connected a host of storage facilities and workshops that ranged in size from meager to cavernous. It reminded Jace of an inverted anthill.</p><p>It was dark in the predawn light but for a wisp of aether, miles long, bent close to the city. Jace was thankful for its pale blue light, which was enough for him to pick out the edges and contours of their circuitous path.</p><p>Then, Jace saw a vertical yellow-orange light appear in space ahead of Kari. In an instant, he snatched the same illusion spell from his mind that he'd used back on the Consulate ship, ready to mask the two of them if the need arose. He waited. Then, above the nagging wind he heard Kari's muted voice, "Ukti, is that you?"</p><p>"Kari," came an unfamiliar voice, raspy and hard. It wasn't entirely unfriendly, a fact that Jace was quick to confirm with cursory telepathic feelers. "I'm surprised to see you here," the voice continued.</p><p>"Why? What happened?" Kari asked.</p><p>"Pia's group lost the Aether Hub. They're all scattered now. Some people started showing up here, but not the ones you're waiting to see."</p><p>"Show me," said Kari. The door swung open to reveal an old dwarven woman, wrinkled with age, but upright and strong-looking.</p><p>Jace followed Kari into a wide, low-ceilinged room arranged like a restaurant, with round, bare-topped, metal tables. From what Jace could see, broad windows encircled the place, though the curtains had been drawn across them all.</p><p>"This is First Launch," Kari informed Jace. "It's a restaurant and club for aeronauts. My parents brought me here a few times when I was kid."</p><p>"You're still a kid, Kari." Ukti rounded on the youth. "What kind of life is piracy for a fifteen-year-old?"</p><p>"Mine," answered Kari, her voice cool, as though she'd given that exact response, with just as much explanation, a dozen times or more. For several breaths, an invisible, unbendable rod seemed to extend between Kari's eyes and those of the elderly dwarf, as they stared coldly at one another.</p><p>Finally, Ukti snorted, and turned to lead the two of them through dining area, pushing in chairs as she went. Soon, they entered a pantry. The shelves were only half full, but Jace wouldn't have known from the collection of smells that met them. At the pantry's far side, Ukti reached behind a spice rack and found something there along the wall, and there came a sequence of low clicks that seemed to originate inside the wall. She then tugged at the corner of the shelf, which pivoted inward silently on rollers to reveal a dimly lit, narrow chamber. Within, a slightly narrower stairway with steep, shallow steps led upward to the sound of muffled voices. Five minds according Jace's mental sweep.</p><p>"Through here," Ukti said with a tired wave.</p><p>"Thank you, Ukti," said Kari. She placed her foot atop the first step, but before she could begin ascending, Ukti seized her wrist and shot a glance around to each of the three of them.</p><p>"Listen," Ukti said, "you are two out of a handful of people who know about this place. It's my sanctum. You treat it with respect."</p><p>Jace navigated the steps after Kari. Below him, Ukti closed the secret door, and the only light came from a circular hole in the ceiling where the stairs terminated. As his feet found each progressive rung, Jace thought of his own sanctum on Ravnica. It was his retreat from the pressures of his Guildpact responsibilities, and he'd grown to rely on it. He knew well the importance of a person's sanctum.</p><p>His head rose through the round portal into a room that was far too small for its current inhabitants. A quick count confirmed his initial assessment, and with Kari that meant six people crammed into a room not much larger than the pantry they had just passed through. Everyone was talking at once, and each person appeared to be carrying on several conversations. In the middle of it all was his own companion. The noise was a little overwhelming, and Jace decided to focus on navigating the final, awkward step into the room. He was contemplating his approach when a thick gauntleted hand reached out from the huddle. Behind it, a voice: "It's a tricky one. Take my hand."</p><p>Jace complied. A strong grip closed around his hand, and he was hoisted into the room.</p><p>Then Jace heard Kari's familiar voice. "Come on in, Jace." She was pushing her way over to him, and his eyes moved from her to take in the cramped space. Every inch of every wall was covered in what Jace discerned to be aviator equipment and tools. Some of it looked very old. To his left, a metal shelf extended from the wall to form a work bench, and it too was covered in all manner of tiny metal bits and instruments. In the far corner, someone sat in an old, worn chair. A second chair in the other corner filled the remaining space.</p><p>"I'm not sure I can be any more 'in' than I am now."</p><p>"No?" Kari smirked, and hung an arm over his shoulder. "Crows!" The conversation in the room quieted as the all eyes turned toward Kari. "This here is Jace. He's a friend of Renegade Prime's, which means he's one of my friends. He's a talented young man and a promising smuggler."</p><p>When the conversations resumed, Jace suddenly found himself in the middle of them. Kari recounted their heist from earlier, and after that came the introductions. They were called the Derby Crows. They had been an aeronaut society that raced skyships in the city, but as things with the Consulate took a turn, they decided as a group to take a more active role in politics. They were at the Aether Hub with Pia when everything fell apart yesterday.</p><p>"Look," Kari said, "I'm supposed to make a drop today, but it appears things are a bit more complicated than I was hoping. How bad is it?"</p><p>A dwarf rose to her feet. Around her neck hung a red scarf embroidered with purple scrollwork, and a white tattoo ran down across her right eye from forehead to cheek. Depala was how she'd introduced herself. "Consulate's spread out from Weldfast to the Spire. They've formed up around <em>Skysovereign</em>."</p><p>"<em>Skysovereign</em>," Kari repeated after a moment.</p><p>"Yeah," said Depala with a nod. "Have a look. Laksha, show them what you showed us."</p><p>The woman Depala had addressed turned around and slid a small gear-shaped door to one side. Jace had missed it on his initial read of the room, but it was very small door with an opening that was no higher than the woman's chest. She had to duck to pass through it. "Come on," she said, but Jace, Kari, and Depala were only able to crowd around the doorway and look out at the woman, who huddled over an apparatus that was perched on a modest platform clinging to the attic's exterior. She didn't seem to mind.</p><div class='figure-wrapper'><figure><img alt='Art by Ryan Alexander Lee' src='http://media.wizards.com/2016/images/daily/c4rd4r7_mupOoQ0Mnw.jpg'><figcaption><a href='https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quicksmith+Spy' class='autocard-link' data-image-url='https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Quicksmith+Spy'>Quicksmith Spy</a> | Art by <a href='http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&amp;method=visual&amp;action=advanced&amp;artist=+%5bRyan%5d+%5bAlexander%5d+%5bLee%5d' target='_blank'>Ryan Alexander Lee</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>"There," she said. "Have a look for yourselves." And then she pushed her way back into the attic. The apparatus was a collection of lenses fixed in a brass frame, and when it was Jace's turn to peer through them, his entire field of vision was filled with the enormity of what could only be the promised <em>Skysovereign</em>, a massive warship that hung heavy in the air like a storm cloud. In the growing light of dawn, Jace could make out scores of smaller escort ships that orbited the flagship.</p><div class='figure-wrapper'><figure><img alt='Art by Jung Park' src='http://media.wizards.com/2016/images/daily/c4rd4r7_DiusTG5zMi.jpg'><figcaption><a href='https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skysovereign%2C+Consul+Flagship' class='autocard-link' data-image-url='https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Skysovereign%2C+Consul+Flagship'>Skysovereign, Consul Flagship</a> | Art by <a href='http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&amp;method=visual&amp;action=advanced&amp;artist=+%5bJung%5d+%5bPark%5d' target='_blank'>Jung Park</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>When he rejoined the group inside, Depala was shaking her head. "There's no way <em>Heart of Kiran</em>'s getting through that monster," she said, spinning the replica's tiny propeller as she spoke.</p><p>After that, no one said anything for a while, and the only sound was Laksha moving the gear door back into place.</p><p>"Kari," the dwarf said, "we're trying to find a way to buy the <em>Heart of Kiran</em> some time to take flight. It's our best shot at the Spire, but this blockade has completely grounded the renegades. We can't even get to our racing crafts," she said.</p><p>"So you have no plan," Jace said.</p><p>Depala threw her hands up. "That's what we've been trying figure out. We need ships, plain and simple."</p><p>Admittedly Jace felt a bit out of his element with all the talk of skyships, though he seized on something the young captain had mentioned after their heist. "What about your fleet, Kari? You mentioned your fleet earlier."</p><p>"Is that true?" asked the large man who'd lifted Jace into the room, a note of optimism rising in his voice.</p><p>Kari shot Jace a look. He got the feeling that he'd said something wrong, but he was already following that question up with another. "Can you send word to them? Kari?"</p><p>"Wouldn't do much good." She leaned against the work bench shelf, and looked at her boots while everyone was looked at her. "They're near Lathnu," Kari said without looking up, "but they're not exactly sky-worthy these days. That <em>Skysovereign</em>'s exactly as you described it, Depala: a monster. It was designed to be a pirate hunter, and it was that and more. When it was done with my fleet, <em>Dragon's Smile</em> was the only ship to make it out. You can find the rest of them scattered in a million pieces in the streets of the village that it destroyed to get to us."</p><p>Then Kari pointed in <em>Skysovereign</em>'s direction, as though she could sense it through the wall. "All I could do was watch as that thing just floated away like it was out for a pleasure cruise."</p><p>Silence once again filled the room. Then Jace stepped toward Kari. "Was it a lot of ships?" he asked.</p><p>"Fourteen, including <em>Dragon's Smile</em>."</p><p>"And how well did you know them?"</p><p>"Very." She raised an eyebrow. "Why?"</p><p>Jace allowed himself a smile. "Then we have no time to waste. I have an idea."</p><hr><p>During the night, the aether current had swept in close to the city, bringing with it the same pod of whales that Kari had seen yesterday during the heist. Kari, knuckles on the starboard gunwale, leaned out from the deck to peer down over the side of her ship at these gathered behemoths. With mouths agape, the whales took turns gulping huge curls of aether, and all along their hides countless speckles lit up with the aether's warm glow.</p><p>From there, Kari's gaze tracked along the sprawl of the city. An updraft sent her asymmetrically longer hair whipping along her right shoulder with such suddenness that Ragavan scurried over to her unassailed shoulder with a litany of annoyed noises. Below the ship's keel, a veil of gauzy clouds spread out over most of the sky below, and the parts of the city seen through it took on an ethereal quality.</p><p>Even from this altitude, she could see the double-pylon tower that loomed as the tallest structure in the city. It was haloed in multiple tiers of circling enforcer skyships, and as much as she attempted to count and assess their various makes and armaments, her eyes were again and again drawn to the floating mass that dominated the airspace between the spire and Weldfast—<em>Skysovereign</em>.</p><p>All they had to do was dislodge it from its aerial perch long enough to create enough of a gap for the renegades' own <em>Heart of Kiran</em> to mount an assault on the grand consul in the spire. So the plan was to draw the Consulate flagship out of position. Toward them. To Kari, it was as though the ship was following her across the world, and she was now supposed to welcome it with open arms. She was suddenly aware of how thin and cold the air up here was, though part of her found more comfort in it than in the prospect of facing the <em>Skysovereign</em> again.</p><p>But then there was the other part of her, the pirate captain part, which demanded satisfaction for the destruction of her fleet. It was that part of her that sent an angry heat up her neck until it boiled over in sharp, hissed words that pushed their way through clenched teeth. "Sovereign of the sky, huh?" Her eyes shifted back to the whales in flight. "I'm not sure they'd agree."</p><p>Kari found her raiders in the cargo hold, seated in two rows facing each other. It was more cramped than usual, with their haul of aether taking up most of the space.</p><p>Seven of the raiders crewed <em>Dragon's Smile</em>, and five were Derby Crows. Each one of them had a flight pack secured to their backs, though the packs varied from raider to raider. Kari took the moment to captain a bit; she strode up and down the narrow space between the two rows, doling out encouraging nods before she drew her sword and addressed them all.</p><p>"Listen up! Your job is to get some attention. Cause enough of a stink for their flagship to take notice. Think you can do that?" An enthusiastic affirmation rose up. "Good. Now remember, this is <em>Dragon's Smile</em>," she said, spreading her arms out to either side. "Today, each one of you is one of its brilliant pointed teeth! And the time has come to show the Consulate just how sharp these teeth can be."</p><p>The cheers of her raiders followed her from the cargo hold, and she let them linger in her thoughts as she made her way to the cockpit.</p><p>When they'd left the Aviaries that morning, Depala had made it quite clear that she'd like to pilot <em>Dragon's Smile</em> during this operation. When Kari asked why she should allow it, Depala had simply said, "Because you know that's where I belong." That much was probably true. Kari had seen her race before, and there was no doubt that the dwarf was one of the best pilots in Ghirapur.</p><p>Kari was going to ask Depala to take the helm, anyway, but she never said so, so when the captain entered the cockpit, it made her smile to see the dwarf already seated at the controls. Behind her, Jace was strapping into his seat.</p><p>Kari secured Ragavan in his spot in an alcove above the pilot. After she had strapped herself in, she asked, "Are you two all set?"</p><p>"Just give the word," said Depala.</p><p>"Jace?" Kari said, shifting in her seat toward him.</p><p>"If I had to choose yes or no, then I suppose yes. But if it's a spectrum—"</p><p>"Depala," Kari called out as she slid her goggles over her eyes, "make like a meteor!"</p><p>"Right away, Captain," said the dwarf, before addressing the crew through the conical end of a communication tube that extended from the ceiling of the cockpit. "Here we go." Then the engines halted with a low sigh, and even before the quad propellers had stopped rotating, the ship was falling. Air rushed around the vessel, and in seconds its mounting whoosh drowned out all other noise. Her straps kept her secured to her seat, but Kari's stomach felt unmoored in her abdomen. It was a discomfort she was used to, and one even Jace, who sat with eyes closed, seemed to be handling like it was nothing.</p><p>Not much time now, Kari intuited. At any moment, Depala would reengage the engines. Through the rounded glass of the cockpit, all Kari could see were flits of white racing up along a backdrop of blue sky. Wisps of cloud, she guessed, but they were moving too fast. Any time now, Depala.</p><p>Then the skyship's nose dipped, and the cockpit was suddenly leading the descent. All at once, the fast-approaching city swung into view, and so did the tops of dozens of Consulate ships arranged in a multi-layered formation that were impossible to count from their vantage. The abrupt shift in gravity pinned Kari and her insides back, and all she could do was watch the panic that was spreading among the formation as they frantically dispersed at their advance. "Look at 'em scatter!" came Depala's voice through her manic laughter.</p><p>"How about those engines, Depala?" Kari said in way that barely resembled a question.</p><p>"Another second." She was enjoying this perhaps a bit too much. "And..." The dwarf's hand shot forward and cranked the lever to engage the engines. The ship obeyed, as Kari knew it would, and she felt the hum of its four rotors working in harmony.</p><p><em>Dragon's Smile</em> soared between the first of the Consulate ships and through the gap in the blockade. "Here we go!" Depala bellowed. She pulled on the control stick, and the ship went into a tight swoop that brought it out of its vertical dive. Then <em>Dragon's Smile</em> was among the Consulate fleet, and the pilot had to weave between the hostile vessels. There was no time for them to catch their breath, though the same was true for the Consulate ships, which were still tangled in their collective scramble.</p><p>Now the real work could begin. "Stay between them until we deploy," Kari said. "They're less likely to open fire if they might hit their own ships."</p><p>"I don't have much choice. They're everywhere!" Depala growled. "If you're going to deploy the crew, do it soon."</p><p>Kari unfastened her straps. "It won't do much good if <em>Skysovereign</em> doesn't take any notice. Just get as close as you can." The young captain rose from her seat and leaned into the communication tube, her words echoing as they made their way through the narrow tube that reached out through her ship and down to her crew in the cargo hold. "Get ready down there! When the hatch opens, deploy! Be as bees—swarm them!"</p><p>For a heartbeat, there was silence. Then, "Bees?" came a tinny voice from the tube. "A moment ago, we were teeth. Sharp teeth. Which is it, if I may be so bold, Captain?"</p><p>That was good. Spirits were up. "What about bees <em>with</em> teeth? How does that sound?"</p><p>"Absolutely terrifying."</p><p>"Wonderful!" Kari meant to say, but the word came out as a gulp as the skyship juked to one side. She caught herself on the back of the captain's chair. "No chance of a warning next time, I take it," Kari said leaning over Depala's shoulder.</p><p>"Afraid not, Captain." Depala sent the ship into a sharp climb that was punctuated by a hard bank. "Have a look." There was no need for her to point, for when they came out of their turn, Kari's field of vision was consumed by <em>Skysovereign's</em> great bulk. It hung there in the air, almost motionless, between two buildings like a predatory bird perched on an invisible branch.</p><p>"There it is," the captain said flatly as her eyes narrowed.</p><p>She turned to the illusionist, who was still motionless, with eyes shut tight, though now pale as a marble statue. She had to admit, he was handling the drop better than she thought. "Jace! Jace!" When his eyelids slid open, Kari barked, "You still with us?"</p><p>He nodded. "I'll be ready when you need me."</p><p>"I truly hope so. In the meantime, I need you to open the cargo bay door to unleash the crew. Turn that crank until it doesn't crank anymore." She pointed to a metallic disk that hung from the low ceiling above Jace's head. "Ragavan, to me!" The monkey scurried to her along the netting on the wall, and by the time he was on her shoulder, Jace was at his task.</p><p>"Where are you going?" he yelled over the screech of the obstinate crank.</p><p>She pulled on a flight pack, and Ragavan had to do some gymnastics to avoid the harness's straps. "I'm going topside to see about keeping my deck clear!" Kari said, clasping the contraption's final strap at her waist. Then she was off at a run, her booted footfalls clanging along the metal floor panels of the central corridor and up a steep set of stairs. At the top, she pushed her way through a low, arched passage that opened onto the chaotic scene that played out all around them—because of them.</p><p>Ships were streaking past from every direction, and Kari felt as though she were moving in slow motion against such a frenetic backdrop. Or rather, the whole thing seemed like the inner workings of an elaborate clockwork toy that had been wound too tight. Fast flying was nothing new to Kari, but she had to admit, Depala was coaxing something out of <em>Dragon's Smile</em> that even she hadn't seen before.</p><p><em>She better not break my ship.</em></p><p>Once at the ship's stern, she was thankful to have the cabin at her back, which protected her from the wind's most insistent clutches. She anchored herself to railing with the cable and winch that was fixed to the bottom of her flight pack. Then, she peered down just as the first of her raiders launched from the yawning cargo bay. They emerged as blurs in twos and threes until all twelve were airborne, carried along on flight packs much like her own.</p><p><em>Well done, Jace</em>, she thought.</p><p>"<em>Thank you</em>," Jace said, his words startling her with their closeness. Like before, they manifested directly in her mind, but it was as though he'd been walking right behind her this whole time. "<em>That crank wasn't easy work.</em>"</p><p>"<em>Dammit, Jace!</em>" she thought back at him, "<em>How long have you been lurking in my head?</em>"</p><p>"<em>I don't lurk. I was about to let you know that the task was done.</em>"</p><p>Kari's eyes flitted from one group of raiders to the next as they wove through the Consulate line like a bunch of angry...bees. Then back to Jace, "<em>Now I need you to close the bay door. Then stay where I can reach you. When I give the command, you know what to do.</em>"</p><p>"<em>Of course.</em>"</p><p>"<em>You remember everything I showed you?</em>"</p><p>"<em>Every detail.</em>"</p><p>"<em>Well, let's hope we won't need it.</em>" Kari watched a Consulate ship suddenly spin out of control when a neighboring vessel struck it with an errant harpoon that was meant for a pair of her raiders. To starboard-low, three Consulate ships collided while in pursuit of a single raider—one of Depala's by the look of her.</p><div class='figure-wrapper'><figure><img alt='Art by James Ryman' src='http://media.wizards.com/2016/images/daily/c4rd4r7_BC5qb1VHkQ.jpg'><figcaption><a href='https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aether+Swooper' class='autocard-link' data-image-url='https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Aether+Swooper'>Aether Swooper</a> | Art by <a href='http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&amp;method=visual&amp;action=advanced&amp;artist=+%5bJames%5d+%5bRyman%5d' target='_blank'>James Ryman</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>"Things are going well so far, wouldn't you say, my prince?"

That's right, Ragavan, check," Kari said as <em>Dragon's Smile</em> continued on its winding course through the blockade. "But not enough. The flagship—the only ship that matters—hasn't budged. And none of this'll mean a damn thing if that sky slug doesn't give chase. Hey!" Kari's hand went to head where Ragavan had tugged at a chunk of hair. The monkey was screeching and pointing toward the streets below.</p><p>"All right, you have my attention." Dozens of Consulate enforcers, equipped with flight packs or mounted on single-seater skimmers, were joining the fight. Most were deploying to screen the ships. But not all of them.</p><p>"<em>Are you seeing this, Kari?</em>" said Jace. "<em>Depala spotted a group of enforcers moving in to intercept.</em>"</p><p>"<em>Six of them, yep</em>," Kari responded. She tested her anchor cable with a quick tug. "<em>Can we shake them?</em>"</p><p>"<em>Depala says she'll do what she can.</em>"</p><p>Kari drew her sword. "My prince—<em>not you, Jace</em>—battle station." Ragavan flicked his goggles into place and scurried into a pouch that was nestled between Kari's shoulder blades where her flight pack curved away from her back. "It's time we got into this fight."</p><p>By the time the first three enforcers rose up along <em>Dragon's Smile</em>'s port side, Kari had already taken flight. Her pack's mechanical wings buzzed furiously as they carried her across the deck, and as she flew, her anchor cable unspooled behind her with a high zipping sound.</p><p>The trio of enforcers were held aloft on identical quad-prop flight packs and were armed with Consulate-issue net-casters, which they clutched close to their chests. There was no sense in waiting to get mobbed by these mooks, so she welcomed them to her ship with all the hospitality of a pirate captain. She raced right at them.</p><p>Or rather, right past them.</p><p>As expected, the enforcers dispersed at Kari's direct approach, and she hurtled straight through them. The cable seemed to draw a line in the air as she flew, separating two of them from the third. Kari saw this and leaned into a tight a turn to sweep around the two. Before the cable could go slack, Kari engaged the winch's break and raced back toward the ship.</p><p>"Ragavan, hang on!" Kari yelled, and her cable caught one of the enforcers in the chest with a loud snap, sending Kari catapulting into the second enforcer, a startled dwarf who couldn't raise his weapon in time. With the first enforcer in tow, Kari and the dwarf tumbled to the deck of <em>Dragon's Smile</em>. Weapons skidded away and they grappled there in a heap of wings and propellers as the ship tilted this way and that.</p><p>There was dull thud when Kari's elbow connected with the dwarf's cheek, and for half a second, the fight seemed to abandon him. Kari shoved him away, and in the next moment, she was in the air again.</p><p>The first enforcer had just untangled herself from Kari's cable with the help of the third one, and Kari wasted no time bowling them both over.</p><p>The victory was fleeting, however, for the three other enforcers joined their comrades. One of them, an officer of some rank, descended to hover before Kari.</p><div class='figure-wrapper'><figure><img alt='Art by Dan Scott' src='http://media.wizards.com/2016/images/daily/c4rd4r7_7iQdi6NrLO.jpg'><figcaption><a href='https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spire+Patrol' class='autocard-link' data-image-url='https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Spire+Patrol'>Spire Patrol</a> | Art by <a href='http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&amp;method=visual&amp;action=advanced&amp;artist=+%5bDan%5d+%5bScott%5d' target='_blank'>Dan Scott</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>Kari sent her thoughts at Jace, "<em>Any progress?</em>"</p><p>And in response came, "Skysovereign<em> hasn't moved.

And more. They kept coming. Even the <em>Sun Chaser</em>—of course the <em>Sun Chaser</em>. Her fleet had returned to her, and they were assembling to fill the space above a plaza so that buildings protected their flanks to either side. One moment, <em>Dragon's Smile</em> was alone, and the next, it was one among dozens. This was Jace, she knew, or rather, the memories she'd shared with Jace. But nevertheless, she couldn't help but be consumed by the feeling that the Consulate was severely outmatched now. The enforcers seemed to share her assessment because all around her, they were taking flight to retreat from the pirate fleet.</p><p>The officer looked from Kari to the wall of ships, then back to Kari. And before the next snide comment could leave Kari's lips, the officer's net-caster fired. Its suddenness caught Kari off guard, and for a moment, Kari just stood there as the net expanded on its path to entangle her.</p><p>But it never got to her. From his pouch on her shoulders, Ragavan pounced. He vaulted off Kari's head, and threw himself into the incoming net. He was entangled instantly, and in the net's clutches, the monkey fell to the deck without any of his usual grace.</p><p>In the next heartbeat, the officer was off—and with her, the net containing Kari's prince.</p><p>"Ragavan!" Kari shrieked. She was already in motion. In the span of four steps, she scooped her sword up from the deck and was leaping over the side of her ship. As the wings of her flight pack flitted into life, a downward swing from her blade severed her anchor cable against the gunwale.</p><p>Kari raced after the officer, and the distance between them closed rapidly. She came in low, and saw that Ragavan was still bundled in the net, which now hung from the officer's waist. "Hang on, prince of mine. I'm coming for you," she said under her breath, and she wished that the monkey shared Jace's mind-reading tricks.</p><p>When Kari caught the officer, it was from below, and before the officer could bank, Kari had grabbed hold of her so that they were hurtling through the air, face to face. The officer tried to shake Kari off, but Kari just wrapped her legs around the officer's.</p><p>"Get off me!" the officer spat.</p><p>"Not while you have my monkey!"</p><p>"You'll kill us both!"</p><p>Kari just winked at the officer, and shoved her sword into the spinning action of one of the four propellers that kept the officer aloft. There was a series of staccato pops and streams of sparks as the propeller tore itself to pieces buffeting against Kari's blade. Immediately, their flight path became erratic, a development exacerbated by the punches the officer rained down on Kari.</p><p>But Kari held on, and she drove her head into the officer's jaw. Pain engulfed her skull but the blows ceased, and she managed to wrest control of their entwined path, if only to influence it. The undamaged propellers tugged the flight pack to one side, and though Kari compensated with her own pack, the tangled group flew ended up in wide semi-circle that took them back toward the projection of the pirate ship, through the <em>Sun Chaser's</em> illusory hull, and beyond the fleet.</p><hr><p>"Kari's not responding," said Jace, his eyes closed against the madness he knew was playing out beyond the cockpit. "She's moving too fast for me to reach into her mind."</p><p>"Just focus on that projection of yours!" Depala snapped.</p><p>And of course, that's exactly what Jace was doing. Though he was physically strapped in his seat behind the dwarven pilot, his mind was at work maintaining the enormous and complex illusion that he'd constructed solely out of memories pulled from Kari's mind—plus a few duplicates here and there to really sell the spectacle. It was a lot of work that required tremendous focus and most of his attention.</p><p>"The <em>Skysovereign</em> will never commit if they see through..." Depala began, but trailed off.</p><p>Jace didn't want to risk opening his eyes, especially not right now. "What's happening?"</p><p>"Bet you could guess."</p><p>He could, but Depala said it anyway. "<em>Skysovereign</em> inbound with escort, moving to engage the fleet. If Renegade Prime's people don't recognize their opening, she and I will have words after this."</p><p>"How should our fleet respond?" Jace asked.</p><p>"Keep them steady. We should be just one of its numbers."</p><p>Jace was suddenly aware of the light strobing beyond his eyelids. He tried to push the visual sensory input from his mind, but then the whole world seemed to turn white and a sound like the sky tearing open boomed in his ears. He pulled his awareness into his illusion to keep it from failing, though he couldn't ignore the metallic taste that had filled his mouth.</p><p>From some distant place, Jace heard his name. There was panic in the sound, which came again and again. He willed his consciousness back into the cockpit, where the world was turned sideways, and where Depala was calling for him.</p><p>"I'm here, Depala," Jace said, which was partly true. Part of him was still keeping the fleet intact. "Were we hit?"</p><p>"Jace! I'm blind!" the pilot yelled.</p><p>"WHAT?!"</p><p>"Take the controls!"</p><p>Even as the ship banked and juked, Jace didn't like the prospect of him at the helm. There simply wasn't adequate time to pull the necessary expertise from Depala's mind. So instead, he returned a favor. During their freefall descent into the Consulate blockade, Jace had staved off panic by reaching out to the absolute confidence in Depala's thoughts. Now, he pulled her into his mind.</p><p>"I can see!" Depala said, and without missing a beat, she pulled <em>Dragon's Smile</em> into a graceful climb.</p><p>"What blinded you?"</p><p>"The lightning cannon on that thing!" And as if to demonstrate, the strobe went off again. This time Depala banked hard to dodge the arc of electricity. All the while, <em>Skysovereign</em> drifted closer. Jace, meanwhile, felt that his hold on his grand illusion could falter at any moment.</p><p>"It certainly seems to like us, despite your illusions," Depala said.</p><p>"This is still Captain Zev's ship."</p><p>"Don't much look forward to facing her if we break it."</p><hr><p>When Kari, Ragavan, and the Consulate officer emerged on the other side of Jace's illusion, they were still locked in their savage airborne brawl. The officer kicked furiously at Kari, and Kari tried to swipe at the net containing Ragavan. The monkey, for his part, reached through his net to occupied himself with riffling the officer's pockets.</p><p>Kari was almost dislodged when the officer caught the young captain below the knee with the sole of her heavy boot, and jerked it downward so that it raked along Kari's shin. Wincing, she bit her lip.</p><p>The pain broke her concentration, and Kari noticed that their path had carried them into an eddy of aether. And in that eddy, colossal shapes were moving. Swimming.</p><p>Skywhales.</p><p>They were creatures without malice or predatory urges, though that did little to assuage the feeling of absolute insignificance that gripped Kari at that moment. Her throat had suddenly become dry, and she realized her mouth was hanging open.</p><p>The officer must have also been struggling with a crisis based on how wide her eyes had grown. It was in that instant that Kari remembered her prince. She wrenched the gathered net from the officer's waist, pushed away from her stubborn adversary.</p><p>Once away, she held Ragavan close. One of the whales bent through the air toward them, and for a moment, Kari was face to face to it. Its mouth seemed to go on forever, and the throat grooves that creased its lower jaw were like canyons. She could have been a mote of dust for all the notice the whale reciprocated.</p><p>Then in Kari's mind, Jace's voice bloomed. It sounded somehow distant, but he was calling her name.</p><p>"<em>Jace!</em>" she replied.</p><p>"Skysovereign's<em> right on top of us. </em>Heart of Kiran<em> is still grounded. We can't last much longer here.</em>" He sounded drained and haggard.</p><p>"<em>No!</em>" She refused to allow <em>Dragon's Smile</em>, the last of her fleet, to meet the same fate. She gave the whale one last look, wheeled around, and sped toward her ship.</p><p>But then she stopped. And all at once, she saw it. Opportunity.</p><p>"<em>Jace, open the cargo door. And when I give the word, have Depala jettison my cargo and climb sharply.</em>"</p><p>"<em>Jettison the aether? Do I understand that correctly?</em>" asked Jace, his words barely registering in her mind.</p><p>"<em>This is for my fleet.</em>"</p><p>She came streaking out from the illusory fleet, and she was met by <em>Skysovereign</em>'s great bulk looming before her. It filled the sky, a metallic reflection of the skywhale behind her.</p><p>"<em>We're right below you, Kari</em>," Jace said, and Kari saw her ship climbing to meet her.</p><p>"<em>Drop the cargo!</em>" Kari thought as loud as she could, while she worked the fastenings of her flight pack. The crates fell from the ship's hold, flipping end over end so that the canisters themselves tumbled out.</p><p>This was it. Kari whipped her flight pack from her shoulders and hurled it down so that it crashed into the glass canisters. Puffs of blue erupted, and as more canisters shattered, the cloud swelled and began to reach out in spiraling wisps. It'd have to be enough to get their attention.</p><p>Meanwhile, Kari cradled Ragavan to her chest and slid onto the <em>Dragon's Smile</em>'s deck as it climbed. Her aching shin screamed at her as they skidded and bounced along the deck's metal surface. Finally, she and Ragavan came to a hard stop when they slammed into the aft railing.</p><p>"<em>Keep clear</em>," Kari thought at Jace, thankful that she didn't have to speak aloud.</p><p>A few moments passed. Then Kari watched Jace's illusory fleet—her fleet—flicker and burst, as one of the skywhales came hurtling through it toward the aether. And directly ahead of the great creature, <em>Skysovereign</em>.</p><div class='figure-wrapper'><figure><img alt='Art by Steve Belledin' src='http://media.wizards.com/2016/images/daily/c4rd4r7_s8rXbKyLo8.jpg'><figcaption><a href='https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aethertide+Whale' class='autocard-link' data-image-url='https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Aethertide+Whale'>Aethertide Whale</a> | Art by <a href='http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&amp;method=visual&amp;action=advanced&amp;artist=+%5bSteve%5d+%5bBelledin%5d' target='_blank'>Steve Belledin</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>While smaller Consulate vessels careened out of its path, the <em>Skysovereign</em> was left to prove its name as the whale met it with full force. It was no contest. Metal squealed and crumpled, and everywhere smoke billowed into the sky. The whale moved off unfazed, while the Consulate flagship coasted in the air for a moment like an errant balloon, before the whole thing listed to one side and drifted slowly to the ground.</p><p>"Prince of mine," she said, "come watch this with me." She helped him find his way out of the net, and she placed him on her shoulder. Then, utterly exhausted, Kari draped her arms over the rail and watched the dying gasps of the metal monster.</p><p>They should probably get out of here, she thought. She was about to give the command when Jace's voice found her mind once again, only this time his words were more animated than she'd come to expect.

<hr />
<p><strong>Previous story</strong>: <a href="http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-story/revolution-begins-2017-01-02" target="_blank">Revolution Begins</a></p>

<p><em>The renegades of Kaladesh rose against Tezzeret's corrupted Consulate. Led by Pia and Chandra Nalaar, armed by the criminal mastermind Gonti, allied with inventors and aether pirates, and supported by the Planeswalkers of the Gatewatch, they have seized Ghirapur's vital Aether Hub. Now they must hold it against Consulate counterattack until the airship </em>Heart of Kiran<em> can be fueled.</em></p>

<hr />
<p><em>Skysovereign</em>'s plotting table was an impressive display of engineering brilliance, decorative artistry, and the Consulate's seemingly inexhaustible funding. It showed, in clear-eyed detail, how poorly the struggle for order proceeded.</p>

<p>On the table before Dovin Baan, mechanical figurines slid along streets color-coded by district; here the green of Kujar, there the blue of Bomat. Cunning puppets in the shapes of the five Gearhulks whirred, stepping carefully, laboriously encircling the filigreed wedge representing the Aether Hub. Slanting dawn sun flooded through the viewports, casting deep shadows between knee-height buildings of brass and tin.</p>

<p>Overhead, an arm-length replica of the dreadnought <em>Skysovereign</em> dangled from the fixtures at the end of an array of wires, pulleys, and servos. Simulated internal lighting winked out from ranks of pinhole viewports.</p>

<p>On a red-painted corner of the Weldfast, another figurine shut its lights off and retracted beneath the map. A dark pin-shape slid down the street to take its place. Peripherally, he heard the report whispered from the operator to his left: "Enforcement squad six-three's automatons have exhausted their aether. The operators spiked the cannon barrels and are pulling back."</p>

<p>On the far side of the command deck, Head Judge Tezzeret—now Special Grand Consul Tezzeret, endowed by the Consuls for the duration of the present crisis—was too occupied with screaming in the face of an orderly to pay any mind to this latest setback.</p>

<p>The Grand Consul seemed to spend more time each day communicating at great volume from short range. Regrettably, one could not dispute the effectiveness of his outbursts (timed, Baan had noted, to occur no more frequently than once an hour). Since the outbreak of the crisis, the command deck staff had been operating above their usual efficiency. Each was a tightly wound spring, noting systemic and situational faults with admirable speed, then moving swiftly to rectify the matter before the Grand Consul noticed himself.</p>

<p>The orderly, a sturdy dwarf bearing an armful of hand-written reports, blinked as a drop of spittle arced onto her cheek. "Sir," she repeated, "that patrol doesn't have the aether. The renegades at the hub have been cutting off the feeds, piping it to some project—"</p>

<p>"So help me," Tezzeret growled. "If you give me <em>one</em> more excuse. Just. <em>One</em>. I will <em>personally</em> ram your head through the—"</p>

<p>Baan stepped forward, heels clicking smartly on the steel deck plates. To have the Grand Consul threaten the life of a messenger, as if he were some criminal thug instead of a minister of the apparatus of state, would unacceptably undercut the moral authority of the Consulate for all those present. Not the <em>legal</em> authority, of course, but one was oft-mistaken for the other.</p>

<p>"This is the potential peril of a centralized aether distribution center," Baan took pains to keep his voice as neutral as possible; flat, unconcerned, perfectly gray. As cool and nondescript as the mists burning off the Vinday River far below.</p>

<p>Tezzeret wheeled away from the orderly and marched around the plotting table, the command crew pulling back from his path, busying themselves at their dials and kinetic readouts.</p>

<p>"We were assured that the facility would be sufficiently protected," Baan continued. "Consul Kambal stated that usurpation by elements hostile to the government would be, if I may quote, 'an utter imposs—'"</p>

<p>Tezzeret glared up into Baan's face. The skin around his lips pulled taut, prematurely gray hair spilling over his shoulders, the crimson tattoos on his forehead crumpled on his furrowed brow. Baan had not yet ascertained the marks' significance, though the pondering of that esoteric knowledge had occupied many idle moments in the last week. They bore no descent from any of Kaladesh's tattooing traditions, and were unlikely to be of his own design; while the Grand Consul's engineering abilities never failed to impress, aesthetics were clearly a matter beneath the level of his concern.</p>

<p>It was a matter of wonder that none of the command staff—nor, indeed, any of the Consuls—suspected Tezzeret's origins. Tattoos of indeterminate origin; the physically impossible tensile strength and conductivity of the metal composing his prosthetic arm; his peculiar manners of enunciation. That unquestioning acceptance would surely end once knowledge of Rashmi's breakthrough became common. Popular imagination would be seized by the possibilities suggested by her device. Entire libraries of speculative fiction would be written.</p>

<p>"I should rip your tongue out," Tezzeret snarled.</p>

<p>Baan raised one brow, carefully, and clasped his hands behind his back. He pitched his voice to polite curiosity; "Indeed?"</p>

<p>The Grand Consul's nostrils flared as obscenities flew from his mouth. Vile, perhaps even shocking, but lacking a certain creative vitality. Not that it was an endeavor worth marking individual distinctions, he supposed. Beyond Tezzeret's shoulder, a member of the bridge crew winced and sank his head lower between his shoulders.</p>

<p>When the Grand Consul fell silent, Baan returned his attention to him. Quietly, so no one beyond the two of them could hear, he said, "I acknowledge the effectiveness of your harangues at keeping this crew aligned and attentive. I, however, am...unimpressed."</p>

<p>The rage fell away from Tezzeret's face, as abruptly as if it had never been there. His eyes, cold and calculating, tightened to a blazing diamond glitter. The Grand Consul had not seemed a danger a moment ago. Now, there was a gleam in his eyes that spoke of an urge to bend something until it creaked and cracked and wriggled...and hold it at that point, just to see what it would do.</p>

<p>One corner of his mouth bent upward, though Baan could not imagine what humor the man perceived. "I need the Aether Hub under our control," the Grand Consul said, in his normal speaking voice. "We pay you to see flaws. Do your job. Find a way. Make it happen."</p>

<p>Baan inhaled slowly. It had been ten hours since the plan had come to him, but he had been unable to persuade anyone of consequence to listen. "If I may?" he gestured to the plotting table. The Grand Consul gave a curt nod.</p>

<p>Baan stepped down to the table, and worked the controls. The majority of the mechanical cityscape retracted into the table, leaving only the regions surrounding the Aether Hub. The renegade barricades, marked by dark pins, cast an ominous, irregular bulge across the smoothly curving lines of roads, railways, canals, and aethertubes of his city. At the hub itself sat a cluster of pins and six mechanical figurines of glittering brass, each marked with a color-coded banner.</p>

<p>Baan pointed to the renegade deployments around the Hub. "They have positioned the majority of their forces at the Hub. A direct assault would be...calamitous. The criminal Renegade Prime commands the position personally."</p>

<p>The Grand Consul's elongated metal claws clacked into something vaguely like a fist. "Pia Nalaar."</p>

<p>"Yes," Baan acknowledged. Pia Nalaar, partner of Kiran, mother of Chandra. All three had been issued death certificates twelve years and seven months previous. He'd been disturbed to find two of the three alive and delved into the archives. But there they were, exactly as he recalled. Place of death: Bunarat. Cause of death: arson. Witnessed by: Captain Dhiren Baral.</p>

<p>Baan worked the controls, and a spotlight fell on a section of the renegade positions: the thin neck connecting the Aether Hub to the wards they controlled. "This focus on defending the Hub leaves their connection to their comrades under-defended. Sufficient pressure from both sides will allow us to complete an encirclement of the Hub."</p>

<p>Tezzeret loomed over the table on uneven fists, glaring at the black pins representing renegade defenders. "No siege, Baan. Every minute, automatons and vehicles run out of aether. Just keeping the Gearhulks powered—"</p>

<p>"I predict they will withdraw defenders from the Hub to keep this corridor open. The architect of their defensive strategy exhibits a certain...two-dimensional thinking. I think it likely to be the—to be our <em>guest</em>, Mr. Jura." Tezzeret lifted a brow at his dissembling, and glanced around at the command crew. If any had noted Baan's tilt to the word, they did not look up.</p>

<p>"He was an infantry commander, according to my research. It is doubtful he has significant experience opposing forces enjoying aerial mobility." He twisted a knob, and a series of black pins at road intersections rose higher. "These are defended barricades of overgrown plants. Almost certainly created by their elven accomplice, Nissa."</p>

<p>Baan's long fingers worked the controls like a concert sitarist, setting legions into motion. "Their defenses are primarily along that outer perimeter, with a reserve at the Hub. Our pincer attack," the ticking figurines pressed the black pins back along the neck of the renegade position, "will draw off that reserve." The pins clustered around the Hub trickled away, bolstering their retreating comrades. "And now..."</p>

<p>A flight of miniature thopters whirred to life on the deck of the model <em>Skysovereign</em>. They wobbled across the table, and delicately alighted atop the model Aether Hub.</p>

<p>Baan nodded and stepped back from the dials and control sticks. "Transports loaded with Inspectors. I am reasonably confident that aerial deployment behind Mr. Jura's forward positions would take him unprepared. We land on the upper decks and press downward. If nonlethal glimmersnap and aetherpulse charges fail to dislodge the defenders, canister explosives would be most effective. Few renegades wear full armor, and there would be little risk of shrapnel damaging the Hub itself."</p>

<p>Tezzeret turned to him, a slight tilt to his neck, an appraising look in his eyes. "Why, Baan. What an uncommonly bloodthirsty suggestion. For you."</p>

<p>"This proposal depends upon timing and inertia," he replied, coolly. "If the renegades decline to retreat or surrender, they must be swept aside, lest delay allow them to concentrate fire upon our inspectors. Deaths are inevitable at this juncture. Better they be militants than our civil servants."</p>

<p>The Grand Consul smiled approval. "Can you assure me this will work?"</p>

<p>Baan frowned. "Of course not. I can only make projections based on what knowledge I am privy to. I estimate an 85-percent chance of success."</p>

<p>Tezzeret drummed his living fingers on the edge of the table, then pushed himself back. He tossed a careless gesture at the model Aether Hub, at the brass figures with their colored flags. "What of your <em>guests</em>, Baan? They complicate things."</p>

<p>"I would judge each to be worth twelve to thirty inspectors, depending on their individual abilities and training. Fortunately, I have had the opportunity to assess their flaws. Most critical is their divided leadership. Gideon and Jace both believe themselves the overall leader. Additionally, Mr. Beleren—"</p>

<p>"I know his flaws." Tezzeret's teeth appeared, momentarily, humorless as a cobra tasting the wind.</p>

<p>"Neither man entirely trusts Liliana. She thinks little of Gideon in turn. Her regard of Jace is more difficult to analyze; a peculiar mélange of protectiveness and contempt. If questioned, I suspect she would be unable to explain it herself.</p>

<p>"Aside from leadership, the group's greatest weakness is Renegade Prime's daughter. She is easily provoked into rash acts, which makes the others overprotective of her. Particularly Gideon and Nissa."</p>

<p>The Grand Consul yanked a speaking tube down from the overhead tangle. "Chief of Compliance Baral to the command deck. <em>Now</em>," he bellowed into the tube. He heard the words reverberate through the halls of the ship.</p>

<p>"Your plan is acceptable." Tezzeret examined his false arm and drew a finger down the length of it. The impossible metal flowed like water under his touch. "I'm <em>improving</em> it slightly. The Nalaars have other weaknesses."</p>

<p>"I am curious," Baan ventured. "What is the significance of the tattoos on your forehead?"</p>

<p>Tezzeret's eyes flickered up and down the length of him, reading his scrupulously neutral posture. "They are to remind me of a debt." One corner of his mouth bent upward, humorlessly. "I wonder, Baan. What flaws do you see when you look at me?"</p>

<p>He considered, briefly. "On that matter, I think it prudent to keep my conclusions to myself."</p>

<p>The Grand Consul barked a short, sharp laugh. "You're not stupid."</p>

<p>He supposed that was what passed for a compliment from Tezzeret.</p>

<p>Baral clanked on to the command deck in full combat gear, helmet tucked in the crook of his elbow. He stopped before the two and made a perfunctory salute. "Baral. As ordered." After a moment, he added, "Sir."</p>

<p>"You've dealt with the Nalaars," the Grand Consul said.</p>

<p>A slow, unpleasant grin spread across Baral's face, turning his scarred cheek into a wasteland of crags and canyons. "That I have."</p>

<p>"You reported the entire family to be deceased," Baan said.</p>

<p>The Chief Inspector's eyes narrowed. He glanced to Tezzeret, who, uncharacteristically, said nothing. At last, Baral grunted, "The fire the child started. It <em>confused</em> things. We discovered the mother among the survivors later."</p>

<p>"Indeed?" Baan said, noncommittally. "It troubles me that the reports do not reflect that."</p>

<p>"Paperwork's your business, Minister," Baral growled. "I <em>work</em> for a living. If you spent a day on the streets—"</p>

<p>"Baral," Tezzeret interrupted, "I want you to distract them."</p>

<p>The Chief Inspector's eyes drifted back and forth between the two, puzzlement bending his mouth. "Sir?"</p>

<p>"<em>Annoy</em> the Nalaars. Lure them away from the Aether Hub. Them, and as many of their friends as you can get to follow."</p>

<p>Baral chortled through his ruined half-nose. "Easy enough. Then what?"</p>

<p>Tezzeret waved a dismissive hand. "Whatever you want."</p>

<p>The Chief Inspector raised his remaining brow. "<em>Whatever</em>, huh?"</p>

<p>The Grand Consul clicked his metal talons together. "Traitors to the Consulate, Baral. Mages with a history of violence. If they won't surrender..." he raised the palm of his mortal hand into the air, face impassive.</p>

<p>Baral straightened, and one canine showed between his lips. Baan couldn't decide if it was a smile or a sneer. "Sure enough. Can't have any dangerous <em>mages</em> running about." He turned to leave.</p>

<p>"Take your squad with you," Tezzeret said. "And Minister Baan."</p>

<p>Baral grunted and slammed his helmet down over his shoulder plates. "Hangar seven, Minister," the words echoed out. "We lift in ten minutes." Then he stomped out, metal-shod feet banging on the deck plates.</p>

<p>Baan turned to the Grand Consul. "Explain."</p>

<p>"Baral's an attack dog," Tezzeret said, looking back to the table. "You're his leash. Let him bite, not chase."</p>

<p>Logical, so far as it went. Baan shifted his weight to the other foot. "What of my plan?"</p>

<p>"I'll oversee its execution. Don't worry," he smiled unpleasantly. "I'll credit you. Failure <em>or</em> success." The Grand Consul hunched over the display, his claws etching fine lines across the polished brass.</p>

<hr />
<p>Mom's upstairs, I guess.</p>

<p>That's where all the other Big Names are. Gonti and Kari and Saheeli and probably some people who don't have names that end in <em>-i</em>. She's in total and complete Renegade Prime mode, so she's not mom right now. She's an engineer, solving a problem. All of them at the top of the Aether Hub are trying to figure out how to punch the Consuls in the nethers.</p>

<p>I yawn because I didn't get much sleep again. Every night since the crackdown, it's just flames and screaming, nightmares like I used to have at Keral Keep.</p>

<p>I'm looking out over Ghirapur, trying to match the blurry places in my head with the sharp ones in front of me. I'm home, but somebody moved all the furniture.</p>

<p>I haven't been able to find the water tower I used to climb. I remember it being the tallest thing around. We'd watch the air races from on top, me and my friends. The boring official ones at mid-day, or the ones the older kids ran at night, shrieking through the streets until Consulate traffic-cutters showed up. Sometimes they'd swoop over my tower, or around, and I had to hold on as hot lightning-smell rushed past.</p>

<p>Everything's <em>taller</em>. The white stone walls and flat roofs I ran across got sunk under brass and turquoise and swirly bits, all glinting and shimmering under noon sun.</p>

<p>The wind smells like a thousand million lunches, dust and metal, aether. Across the streets, beyond the barricades, the Consulate's panharmonicons are still blaring "The Gremlin's Wedding March" at us on infinite repeat at double speed. They left them on all night, and after the moon set Nissa started crying, hands clamped over her ears.</p>

<p>I didn't know what to do. I wanted to help but my hands wouldn't go, they just flapped around her like peafowl, and I probably said something dumb again.</p>

<p>Jace sat down with her. They talked a minute and his eyes flashed. She curled up in a big potted plant and didn't wake up until the sun fell on her.</p>

<p>I miss mom.</p>

<p>I missed her for a long time, but I got over it. Twelve years is a long time to walk around being a wreck. Which I guess is funny, since everyone probably thinks I'm a wreck all the time, but for like two years I couldn't even breathe.</p>

<p>Now she's back, somewhere up above me, just a little bit away. She's so busy fighting a war, I only see her—hear her—when she covers me with a blanket. She probably thinks I'm asleep because it's so late when she gets out of her meetings, but I'm always awake, turned away with my face in the pillow, holding my breath and waiting for her to sit down on the edge of the cot.</p>

<p>But she never does and I can't be <em>over it</em> anymore.</p>

<p>I want her to hug me like at the arena. To talk to me about anything that's not the Consulate for just ten minutes, to put her hands on my too-pale cheeks and <em>tsk</em> at me for getting sunburned when she doesn't. I want to smell spilled oil and electric burns on her coat. I want her to braid my hair, like she did before I took the pruning shears to my own head that summer it got super hot. I came down from the rafters and spun around all proud, enjoying the wind on the back of my neck, and she started crying. Then she got Nani Jalbala's old scissors and evened it out, and told me I looked great, real grown-up.</p>

<p>I want to tell her what I've done, what I made of myself, because she only knows the Chandra that screws up all the time.</p>

<p>The last time she saw me, I was screwing up. Bringing the Consuls down on us.</p>

<p>Getting dad killed.</p>

<p>Is that it? Does she blame me? Is that why she won't talk to me? I would, if I were her. I blame me.</p>

<p>That was what the Purifying Fire showed me, back on Regatha. When I last had nightmares. I thought, <em>I'm responsible, I did it, I screwed up and got everyone killed</em>. Dad. The villagers. Mom. That was why the cold of it stopped burning. Why the hiss of the flame whispered, "You can be forgiven." But I never forgave me.</p>

<p>It was a stupid fire anyways. You couldn't even roast nuts with it.</p>

<p>The deck creaks behind me. Footsteps. I swipe at my eyes because what if it's someone I don't know? Or worse, someone I know.</p>

<p>What if it's Nissa?</p>

<p>I haven't thought about what I did on Ravnica. Every time I do, I wanna curl up and pull a blanket over my head. She was nothing but nice to me and I—<em>It's just, you've been staring at me.</em> I watched her die a little inside.</p>

<p>My cheeks and hair ignite. I slap out the flames. The footsteps get closer, slower.</p>

<p>Then we got here, to Kaladesh, all I did was yell at her about my mom. I didn't even think about her. Why did she even <em>come</em>, after I made her so uncomfort—</p>

<p>Oh <em>crap</em>. I hugged her when we were looking for mom. <em>Twice</em>. Without even thinking, because when do I ever? Even though I <em>know</em> how she twitches just when someone brushes past her. She must have been mentally clawing the ceiling. I'm such a—</p>

<p>"Chandra?" A big voice, pitched low, hesitant.</p>

<p>Oh. "Hey Gids."</p>

<p>He hangs himself over the rail an arm's length away, resting on big, muscly forearms. The slouch brings his eyes down level with my own. "How are you holding up?"</p>

<p>I look out across the streets. Except for panharmonicons, everything's still and empty. A hundred thousand people hide in their homes, waiting for the monsoon to break. Hot wind presses my hair back from my forehead. "...I'm fine."</p>

<p>A small breath escapes him, half laugh, half sigh. "Chandra, it's...This is none of my business. I know that. I'm sorry. You've had a lot of shocks. Coming home. Finding your mother alive...That's a <em>good</em> shock, but still a lot to adjust to. Then the man who—then a man tried to murder you. Now your home's in the middle of a civil war. That's more than anyone should have to deal with in two months."</p>

<p>"So you're saying I'm, what, <em>unstable? </em>That it?" Are my hands shaking? My hands are shaking. Damn it, stop that.</p>

<p>I feel big sympathetic Gideon eyes on my shoulder. His voice turns even quieter. Over the frenzied bridge of "The Gremlin's Wedding March" he rumbles, "I'm saying...you feel things very deeply. That's one of the things I—one of the things that's great about you. If you need someone to talk to, or just to vent at, I'm here, all right? Whenever."</p>

<p>He's so damn <em>sincere</em>. I liked that about him when we met. After I was done being mad at him, anyway. A very sincere, bossy, kind, preachy, thoughtful, annoying, adorable stick in the mud. With muscles in all sorts of potentially interesting places. And eyes with a million colors, like a landscape by...some artist who's real good at landscapes. Also abs you could grate cheese on, which I totally did not think about running my hands over for like six months afterward, so far as he knows.</p>

<p>Feels like forever ago. Was I really just nineteen? Like, a kid? I wonder how old he was. Or is. Either'd be fine. I can do math; my mom's an engineer.</p>

<p>I yawn again, so hard my eyes tear up. I don't know why I say, "Gids, you remember when we met?" and look at him sidelong through my hair.</p>

<p>He looks up fast and opens his mouth, but stops and shakes his head. "...Very well."</p>

<p>"I've been thinking about it lately."</p>

<p>He looks out over the streets. "Why's that?"</p>

<p>"I've been dreaming again." I look away into the wind, and it stings my eyes.</p>

<p>He inhales, and tries to make it sound all casual-like. "I see." He hangs awkwardly over the rail, and scratches at his beard. "Like the one you had—?"</p>

<p>"On Diraden. Yeah." Diraden, where night was forever, and we slept in one sagging cot that smelled like mold in a rotting village full of jerkwads. I woke up sweating and panting and gritting my teeth so I didn't shriek from another dream about Bunarat burning. And his big arms locked around me, holding me awake in that horrible present and not the nightmare past, and he didn't let go until my shakes went away.</p>

<p>"Sorry," he says quietly, blushing at the deck. "I shouldn't have done that. Not without asking first. I just woke up, and you were...<em>hurting</em>."</p>

<p>"Yeah, I was." I punch his arm, but I'm not feeling it. It's more a tap. At least not a whiff. "If I hadn't been all right with it, you <em>better</em> believe I'd have told you. Then set you on fire."</p>

<p>"I was wondering why you seemed tired lately." He picks the peeling paint on the rail. A flake pops off and spins away on the wind. "You told me then that you came from a place where magic, especially fire magic, was illegal. That your family tried to hide it. That you were responsible for a village being burned, for your parents' deaths." He hunts for words. "You confessed...a shadow of the truth."</p>

<p>My brain brings old thoughts back, foggy and full of holes. A darkened cell, lit by shimmery moon-on-water light from spells that kept me from casting. <em>You face the things you've done</em>, he said, <em>and accept the weight of your responsibility for your deeds. Without lies, or excuses. What did you do that left you with ghosts to carry?</em></p>

<p>Just for a breath, I'm back in that cell, feeling sick, ashamed. Wondering if there was a bucket I could puke into, and if not, where I could aim that would miss his shoes?</p>

<p>"I didn't know you, Gids. Not enough, not then. Everything I said was true, it just wasn't <em>all</em> the truth. I told you the important bits. The fire. The screams and—and the smells, and how it felt. How it was my fault. H-how I got them all killed." I clear my throat to hide the break in my voice, which he probably heard, but wouldn't ever say, because that's the sort of Gideon he is. I rub under my nose with a shaking hand, sniff, and wipe it off on my shawl.</p>

<p>He sighs, and slides his hand next to mine on the rail. Not quite touching. Just...offering. One part of me wants to grab it and hold on. "Well," he says, "what you admitted must have been enough. The Purifying Fire wanted acceptance of responsibility. Not all the i's dotted and t's crossed." He pauses. "At least, that's what they told me. I didn't walk through it like you did."</p>

<p>I crack a smile and reach up to ruffle his hair. I have to stand on tiptoes for it, and lemme tell you, that's not easy in armored boots. "A good guy like you wouldn't have had anything to worry about."</p>

<p>His arms tense. "I wish that were true." He glances at me, then turns his head aside, like a shy puppy. "I'm responsible for things I can't make up for."</p>

<p>My hand drifts under my nose, and I pretend to rub away a sneeze. My fingers smell like his hair. Like herbs that don't grow here. Is that what the wind smells like on Theros?</p>

<p>"I blew up a museum," I blurt. <em>WHAT?</em></p>

<p>He looks back to me, wide-eyed. "<em>What?</em>"</p>

<p><em>Roll with it, Chandra.</em> "I didn't mean to! When we met. On Kephalai. Remember? The Sanctum of Stars. Trying to steal the Dragon Scroll? You turned me in for it. Prison, snake-head guys, all that?"</p>

<p>He winces.</p>

<p><em>Wait, no, wrong direction, put the thopter in reverse, ARG!</em> "You were right, though. When you said I was hurting innocents. I—I don't know about the <em>guards</em>. I don't trust guards. Not anymore, maybe not <em>ever</em>. But the Sanctum was all full of people, and—"</p>

<p>When the walls came down, I thought of all the people I'd seen inside. The grandmothers pointing to displays and saying I remember that, in those days, now here's a funny old story, in exactly the same way Mrs. Pashiri used to, and the children rolling their eyes, bouncing in their fraying shoes and looking for a place to run, someplace not dusty and faded but full of light and impossible things. The stones came down on all of them. My fault. Not what I wanted, but <em>my fault</em>. Another screw up.</p>

<p>I think I've been quiet too long, because he takes a step toward me. "Chandra." He does lay his hand over mine this time. It's warm and dry, rough with old callouses. "You didn't <em>mean</em> it."</p>

<p>"But I <em>did</em> it, Gids. There are these times when I'm sitting in the bath, and the memory comes up on me outta nowhere. I cringe and I say 'stupid,' like actually out loud, and then I sink under the water. And, um, usually the bath turns into a sauna at that point..." When was the last time I took a bath, anyway? After the last few weeks, I must smell like a goblin blacksmith. "You of all people—"</p>

<p>"I know." He takes his hand away and passes it through his hair, settling the bits I left standing up. I kinda want to ruffle it again. "Chandra, you didn't think about them at the time. Now you do. That you regret it now...it means you've grown. And that you're a good person. <em>Fundamentally</em>."</p>

<p>I turn away and pace across the deck. There's a potted ornamental jasmine by the stairs in full bloom. I pull off one white petal and twirl it between my fingers. "It means I'm a screw up, Gids."</p>

<p>He takes a breath, and winces again. "Sometimes," he says, "yes. <em>Sorry</em>. But you're always...doing your best. That doesn't always help, but it matters. It means you can make it right."</p>

<p>My lips twist. The petal tumbles from my fingers, carried away by the wind. "Anyway...my point is that whatever you've done, it can't be as bad as all the things <em>I've</em> done, and if the Purifying Fire would let someone like me through, someone like you—someone who thinks about the things they do, like, <em>chronically</em>—would have no problem, and if it couldn't see that it's <em>definitely</em> a stupid fire, and I'm glad I broke it." The words stop tumbling out, and I take a breath.</p>

<p>He looks at me dubiously. "<em>That</em> was your point?"</p>

<p>"Maybe not when I started talking, but that's what it is now." I fold my arms across my chest and make a fake frowny face up at him. "So do you feel better or not?"</p>

<p>Gids blinks. Then he laughs, broad and deep. "I actually do. Thanks." He steps back and glances up the tower. "But I should get back upstairs. See how the defenses are shaping up. If you need anything, just ask, all right?"</p>

<p>I need my mom. I need to sit next to her, feel her arm and shoulder and hip bumping against me as she eats one-handed while scribbling equations. I need to eat methi thepla she made just for us, even though she always burns it a little. I need to rest my head on her shoulder. I need to feel her arms around me because it's been so long.</p>

<p>He's five steps away when I blurt out over the rail, "Wait! This is dumb, but I could use a—a hug. If you don't mind. I know; that's weird. I was just thinking how I hadn't had any time with mom, not even <em>just</em> <em>ten minutes</em>, and—"</p>

<p>"Chandra."</p>

<p>"You don't have to. Hugs are super personal, right? I mean, you saved my life and all, but that's not a hug. Anyone would save anyone, that's just what you <em>do</em>. Maybe not Lili. And anyways I saved you back, so that doesn't even count—"</p>

<p>"Chandra."</p>

<p>"And I know <em>asking</em> for hugs isn't normal. You're supposed to <em>offer</em> them. There's this moment when I'm looking at someone, and it's like gravity or something. It's like I just <em>know</em>, but I don't know, you know? <em>Sorry</em>. This is all coming out wrong, and—"</p>

<p>"<em>Chandra</em>."</p>

<p>Am I shaking again? I clench my twitching fingers. What the actual hell, Chandra? I swallow hard, wipe my eyes, and turn. He's standing with arms wide, smiling. His fingers wiggle <em>come on, come on, you big silly</em>.</p>

<p>Right. Now I have to be cool. Walk over slow, like it doesn't matter <em>whoops</em> I'm already up against him with my arms around his waist. I'm absolutely sure that I didn't run over, so don't you tell me teleportation magic doesn't exist anymore.</p>

<p>He's so damn huge. My head fits under his chin. He smells like sweat and oil, the grime of a long day <em>lifting</em> things.</p>

<p>I burrow into his arms like a puppy, rest my cheek on his chest, and close my eyes. His heart pounds under my ear. He wraps himself completely around me, armor and all, breath tickling the top of my head.</p>

<p>It's been a long time since anyone held me like this. If Gids had done this four years ago, it would have made me feel tingly in all the places I like. Now it just feels...</p>

<p>...<em>Safe</em>.</p>

<p>There's a gentle clatter of porcelain.</p>

<p>I open one eye and peer over a bicep to see—<em>OH CRAP</em>.</p>

<p>I shove at Gids, but he's so big I stumble backward instead. His jaw drops, and he takes a step back, looking at me in horror. Oh no, Gids, you didn't do anything—</p>

<p>"I didn't mean to disturb you."</p>

<p>Nissa sets a plate of eggplant and potato curry on one of the benches, eyes down, careful, long fingers sliding porcelain across steel. There's a huge, perfectly ripe mango nestled in the crook of her arm. Her braid sways in the wind.</p>

<p>"You're not." I paw at the rail, grab, steady myself. "We were just talking, and—"</p>

<p>"Don't mind me, then." She pulls apart the stem of the mango—was she growing that out of her <em>clothes?</em>—and places it beside the plate. "I brought this in case you were hungry." She straightens and looks straight at me, calm, hands clasped before her. A million years of suspended green.</p>

<p><em>BLINK</em>. <em>BREATHE</em>. Don't screw this up. Just have a normal conversation with her.</p>

<p>"Gids came down to see how I was, and we started talking, and there was this time he got me arrested for blowing up a museum—" <em>YOU ARE SCREWING THIS UP</em> "—but actually he didn't want to, and we ended up on a plane where we fought this creepy I'm-a-gentleman-m'lady vampire, and then I was thinking about my mom and—"</p>

<p>She lowers her eyes, lashes falling. "Tell me later, if you wish. Excuse me." She turns, framed by the ornamental jasmine. All its blooms have pulled tight, sealed and green.</p>

<p>How do I keep screwing up like this? Innistrad gone all explodey? Perfectly fine, thanks. Talking to Nissa? <em>Human trash fire</em>.</p>

<p>That can't be my hand falling on her shoulder, making her shudder at the pull, because I know better, don't I? "D-don't go," I stammer. "I mean, you're upset. I upset you."</p>

<p>"No?" she says, cautiously, testing the word. "<em>No</em>. There is...much I don't understand. But I'm not upset with you. Believe that."</p>

<p>She raises a hand, and gently peels my burning fingers from her shoulder. Hers are cool and smell of summer fruit, sunset bonfires, twilight rain. Or maybe I just imagine they do. "You needn't be concerned."</p>

<p>"<em>CHANDRA NALAAR!</em>"</p>

<p>It's probably real funny, the way we jump.</p>

<p>I should be more freaked out about freaking Nissa out by brushing her arm as I whirl around, but I'm too busy looking out across Ghirapur because "The Gremlin's Wedding March" has finally fallen silent and <em>I know that voice</em>.</p>

<p>"<em>I know you can hear me.</em>" A deep rasp, magnified and tinny, bouncing off the stone and steel around us.</p>

<p>"Who is that?" Gids. He puts his shoulder in front of me, frowning out at the glittering roofs. His whippity-swords snake out.</p>

<p>I try to say "Baral," but my throat's full of dirty water.</p>

<p>"<em>I was wondering.</em> <em>Have you told your friends the story? About how you got daddy killed? How you got mommy locked in a cell for five...long...years?</em>"</p>

<p>Everything goes white. Sparks are flying from my eyes. I don't care.</p>

<p>"<em>Mommy and I talked every day. Oh yes, we did. I reminded her of everything you did. Every day. Did she tell you?</em>"</p>

<p>Mom?</p>

<p>"<em>Maybe she was too </em>ashamed<em>.</em>"</p>

<p>No!</p>

<p>"<em>Some days she cried. When I told her how your flames took daddy. How he died screaming, skin black and cracking. How he died cursing your birth.</em>"</p>

<p>"<em>THAT'S A DAMN LIE!</em>" It comes out shrill and ragged. The voice of an eleven-year-old.</p>

<p>Gideon's yelling up the tower. Something about spotters, thopters, I don't know. Lightning cracks above my head and puffs of dust rise from the rooftops across the road.</p>

<p>Baral's laughing. "<em>So many died that day, little monster</em>."</p>

<p>"I'm gonna kill him. I'm gonna burn him." The words hiss through gritted teeth, falling like the stars from my eyes.</p>

<p>"That's what he wants." The only thing I can hear apart from heart-thunder is Nissa. Why is she still here? Why would she stay?</p>

<p>"I can't leave this." My hands are balled up, glowing, wreathed in flame. "Don't stop me. I can't let him—"</p>

<p>In the corner of my eye, her hand hovers over my arm, not quite touching.</p>

<p>"I know," she says. "I'll stand with you."</p>

<hr />
<p>Gideon bellowed at the upper decks, "Everyone on alert! This could be a diversion!" He squinted up into the noon sun, caught the acknowledging waves. He turned back. "Chandra—"</p>

<p>Was gone.</p>

<p>Over the bray of amplified laughter, he heard the thunder of her boots on the stairs, the shriek of metal on metal when she slipped on corners taken too fast, curses echoing skyward.</p>

<p>"You should have stopped her!" He bolted to the rail and leaned over.</p>

<p>Nissa was on the stairs leading down, one foot halted in midair by his question. "Why?" she said.</p>

<p>He clenched his fists. "This is—She could get herself <em>killed</em>. Calling her out like that? He's riling her up for an ambush. She's not thinking, just feeling, and we should be the ones who..." His stomach pulled taut, stabbed by ice, suspended in free-fall. Why wasn't he halfway down the stairs already?</p>

<p>Nissa's head tilted to the side. "This is who she is, Gideon."</p>

<p>Far below, a shock of flickering red flame leapt from the Hub, making his heart claw up his throat for long mid-air moments. Then she tumbled across the adjacent roof and staggered up to her feet, still snarling curses.</p>

<p>"Jura!" a voice from above, faint on the wind. "The Gearhulks are advancing on our lines!"</p>

<p>"I—" He was going after her. Wasn't he?</p>

<p>He squeezed his eyes shut and pulled the hot midday air in through his nose, slowly, focusing on the scents of oil and smoke. The tinny bleating of the man on the loudspeaker fell away. A tremor passed up from his feet, as a hollow boom sounded in the distance.</p>

<p><em>There comes a time, boy, </em>Hixus' voice echoed forth from years long gone, <em>when you must choose between what you want to protect, and what you </em>need<em> to.</em></p>

<p>He opened his eyes, fixed them on Nissa's endless ones, and exhaled through his mouth, forcing the air into words that tasted like ash; "Keep her safe." She nodded and disappeared.</p>

<p>He bolted up the stairs, and tried not to think about the fleeting heartbeats when he'd been privileged to hold a tiny, maddening, precious sun against his chest.</p>

<hr />
<p>Baral's boots crunched into the pavement upon landing, driving the air out of his lungs. He was on his feet and running again in seconds. It was all going as planned.</p>

<p>He was already slowing, though. Panting, breaths like handfuls of needles heaving from his lungs. He'd never had to run in the armor before. At least not more than a few dozen steps. Just enough to get within arm's-length of whatever would-be mage thought their abilities gave them a range advantage.</p>

<p>He was old. Heavy. <em>Slow</em>.</p>

<p>He'd never recovered the feeling in his left arm. Oh, it hung at his side still, and after years of painful effort, it moved obediently again. But he'd never again be entirely sure he was holding a weapon or soup spoon tight enough. Once, in winter, his sleeve had caught on fire from standing too close to the barracks heater. All he could do was laugh as the already-ruined flesh charred and stank. It was too hilarious not to. He even wore the helmet less than he used to, in the years after the monster had burned half his face off. It had become another tool of intimidation, a reason for accused mages to flinch away.</p>

<p>She'd ruined him.</p>

<p>Baral clunked down the alleys—left, right, left again—in the order that Baan had insisted he repeat too damn many times on the flight in. Around him, the buildings were no longer new and bright, but trickled away in a slow decay of gravel and dust. Sweat pooled in his collar, hot breath thickened the air in his helmet.</p>

<p>Behind him, the Nalaar girl raged and cursed, random obscenities echoing along the stone alleys.</p>

<p>He grinned. She was taller than he remembered, but her brain seemed no bigger. Just as prone to screaming and throwing punches when staying quiet would be wiser. Blundering into one trap after another since she'd come home. That's why he'd win.</p>

<p>That's why he'd ruin her.</p>

<p>The location had been Baan's suggestion. A maze of old-construction stone buildings along the river, stripped and bare, their yards long dried up and blown away. Nothing <em>combustible</em> anywhere.</p>

<p>He swung around a corner, tipped up the filigree mesh of his helmet, and bellowed over his shoulder, "All that time your mother <em>suffered</em>. Thinking you were <em>dead</em>."</p>

<p>She sprinted around the far corner, wreathed in a crimson cometary nimbus. Lips pulled back from her teeth as she spread her fingers, stretched out her arm, and <em>shoved</em>.</p>

<p>The air between them ignited in a rush, a sucking roar he had to steady himself against the pull of. A curtain of white-gold fire rippled toward him like the Aradara Express.</p>

<p>He raised a single hand, fingers spread through a corona of frigid blue, and with a dismissive wave evaporated the blast. Stray embers tumbled along the road, finding no purchase among the dust and stones.</p>

<p>"And what were <em>you</em> doing while she rotted?" he sneered. "Off enjoying life?" He ducked around the corner as she stumbled and swore, sparks streaming from her flaming hair.</p>

<p>A high, giddy laugh of glee welled up from the pit of his stomach as he raced away from her, but he didn't allow it past his teeth. He'd spent thirty years suppressing the things that bubbled up from within him.</p>

<p>The air reverberated with the whir of thopter wings. Almost to the target site. His squad would be circling around behind the monster, ready to spring the—</p>

<p>He wheeled around the next corner and skidded to a halt.</p>

<p>The road was blocked by a wall of red-black brambles, hook-tipped thorns, and spreading emerald leaves.</p>

<p><em>That...wasn't here before.</em></p>

<p>He spun just in time to launch his armored boot into the girl's stomach. She folded around it, retching.</p>

<p>He stumbled back and raised his sword as she vomited into the dirt. The flames enfolding her brightened to fever yellow as he charged forward, swinging the blade.</p>

<p>She swung her armored forearm into the blow, sparks flying as metal slid across metal.</p>

<p>Her left arm, wreathed in flame, swung around...a wide miss, passing behind him.</p>

<p>He almost laughed.</p>

<p>Then she spat bile on the road and lowered her left shoulder, slamming into his chest. Something popped. She gasped.</p>

<p>He stumbled backward into furious heat.</p>

<p><em>She set the thorns on fire!</em></p>

<p>With his dead left arm, he ripped the flaming cloak free off his pauldrons and dropped it in the street.</p>

<p>He needed to get around her. She couldn't force him back into the blaze.</p>

<p>Thopter buzz set pebbles of old pavement into clattering migrations. "<em>Chief!</em>" a voice called down over the din, flat and tinny with mechanical amplification.</p>

<p>The girl gritted her teeth, sparks whirling from her eyes, and moved to shove her left arm at him—but she only gasped, eyes unfocused with pain. The arm dangled limp at her side.</p>

<p>There.</p>

<p>He swung his sword into her corona, twisting to strike at the limp arm. She skittered back, overcompensating. Not a trained fighter. Just an angry child.</p>

<p>A roiling ball of flame spun to life around her right fist, and...she went down hard, the dead weight of the limb pulling her down into the dust.</p>

<p>He knew how an arm that wouldn't move affected balance. Yes, he certainly did.</p>

<p>Flickering thopter-wing shadows passed over him as he raised the sword. The metal had been forged for heat tolerance, but passing through the girl's yellow-white blaze had already left it radiant and warped. He drove it down at her neck.</p>

<p>His arm was yanked to a halt, wouldn't move.</p>

<p>He glanced to it—<em>wrapped in</em> <em>a flaming vine?</em>—and that was all the mistake she needed. The fire held in her hand burst open, flaming petals licking across his armor, searing through his faceplate.</p>

<p>He blinked away smoke, and coughed a laugh. By the smell in his helmet, he'd just lost the other eyebrow. The girl was scrabbling away on her back, gasping with pain as her limp arm trailed behind her. Overhead, his squad's thopters arced in, trailing streamers of white vapor across the blue sky.</p>

<p>A trio of vines leapt up from the neighboring streets, raining debris. They snapped around the lead transport's cabin, pinning one of the fluttering wings. It slewed off balance, engine roaring, and slammed into the side of a building.</p>

<p>He blinked away from the fireball. The building collapsed, pulsing out a wave of pale dust that rattled across his armor.</p>

<p>His eyes leapt to the roofs. There!</p>

<p>"<em>Two hundred meters south!</em>" Baral bellowed over the din, waving toward the silhouette. "<em>Elf on the roof!</em>"</p>

<p>The second thopter spun, unleashing staggered forks of electricity. Thunder cracks rolled across the city.</p>

<p>A wall of black earth and plant life reared up behind the elf, cupping massive hands of wood and soil around her. The bolts dissipated across them. The plants lunged up, twining into a four-legged monstrosity that crouched protectively over its mistress.</p>

<p>Roaring, the elemental beast bounded after the support thopter. The elf leapt gracefully to the road, sprinting to the Nalaar girl. She was staggering to her feet, red hair extinguished by pale dust, cheeks streaked with tears. Of pain or anger, he couldn't tell. It didn't matter.</p>

<p>This trap had failed. If the elf hadn't been here, he could've salvaged it, but—no time for that. He gestured to the final thopter and unlatched his warped gauntlet-blade, hurling it blindly at the two women.</p>

<p>The thopter came in low over the road, raising a sandstorm of pale chalk.</p>

<p>He armed and aimed his grapple. Baan leaned out of the cabin, frowning at the situation, then stumbled backward as Baral's hook slammed into the lift cage.</p>

<p>The elf had reached the girl, who stumbled toward her, nostrils flaring. "I can't move my arm, <em>I can't move my arm!</em>" she panted, eyes wide.</p>

<p>"It's all right," the elf said, running her hands over the shoulder. "Just dislocated. Let me..."</p>

<p>The grapple engaged, yanking him up as the Nalaar girl loosed a sharp yelp of pain.</p>

<p>Baral swung into the cabin as the pilot lifted away. "I want a Gearhulk on the elf. <em>Now!</em>" he snapped.</p>

<p>Baan's eyes flickered over him. He grabbed a replacement gauntlet-blade off the rack and latched it fast, as casually as if he did it every day. When would he have learned that? "Chief Baral," he shouted over the engine's din, "we are not authorized to call in—"</p>

<p>"We have to crush them," he growled. He clamped his dead left hand over the ceiling rail and leaned out into the wind, looking behind them. The other thopter was ascending, nose ducking as it accelerated toward—</p>

<p>The elf's elemental leapt up from the streets and clawed it from the sky.</p>

<p>He swore at the fireball. <em>Just goddamn dirt!</em> "The Torrential could <em>wash</em> this damn thing away—"</p>

<p>"We are a <em>diversion!</em>" Baan insisted.</p>

<p>He stepped back from the edge, teeth bared, and loomed over the Minister. Baan stared up at him coolly. "You have no sensation in your left arm. I have determined three ways to use that knowledge to fully impair your movement."</p>

<p>They glared at each other for long breaths.</p>

<p>"Four, now," Baan said.</p>

<p>"Fine," Baral snarled.</p>

<p>He tapped the pilot on the shoulder and made a circle-around hand gesture. As the thopter banked, he grabbed a megaphone off the equipment rack, and positioned himself by the bay door.</p>

<p>The Nalaar girl glared up, swiping at her eyes in the light of the burning wall of thorns. The elf stood by her side, one light hand on the injured shoulder.</p>

<p>"<em>Does </em>she<em> know, little pyromancer?</em>" he bellowed down at them. "<em>Did you tell her? About the village that burned because of you? The screams of the children?</em>"</p>

<p>The monster just shrieked, high and inarticulate, hair ablaze. A gout of white flame shot upward.</p>

<p>The thopter couldn't evade in time.</p>

<p>He reached out and felt the red threads that bound the flames together. His fingers sank into the weave of it, flexed, ripped them apart. The flames scattered, impotent.</p>

<p>At his side, Baan stiffened.</p>

<p>The girl hollered obscenities up at them, constellations of sparks spinning from her eyes in the downdraft.</p>

<p>Baan yanked the megaphone to his mouth. "<em>Those devices are certified for external use only. A malfunction could seriously injure one's sph—</em>"</p>

<p>She gestured up at him, emphatically.</p>

<p>"<em>I am only interested in the safety of all citizens</em>," Baan said, huffily.</p>

<p>Baral slapped the megaphone out of the Minister's hands. It pinwheeled into empty space. "She's <em>diverted</em>. Get me someplace visible from the Aether Hub." He grinned. "Someplace we can inspire <em>mommy</em> to join us."</p>

<p>Baan held his appraising eyes on him for a moment, then looked away out of the cabin as they lifted away from the street. "The next phase of the operation has begun."</p>

<p>Baral followed his glance. High above them, the black specks of thopters lifted from the decks of <em>Skysovereign</em>.</p>

<hr />
<p>Gideon shoved the old man clear and had just enough time to look up before the massive steel foot stamped down on his head.</p>

<p>Darkness.</p>

<p>Grinding. Metal on metal shrieks, vibrations through gravel and dirt.</p>

<p>Daylight, filtered through downward-spinning motes of dust.</p>

<p>He reached up, grabbed splintered pavement edges, and pulled himself out of the hole. The old man, sprawled by the side of the road, gaped at him. Gideon gave him a reassuring grin and shook the dirt out of his hair with one hand. "It's all right," he called, with forced cheer. "I'm indestructible." The ground shook as the Gearhulk's foot fell again. He'd have to thank Nissa for their practice back on Ravnica.</p>

<p>Nissa. <em>Chandra</em>. Where were they?</p>

<p><em>No time for that. On your feet, hoplite. Observe the situation. Keep moving. Turn the initiative.</em></p>

<p>He staggered to his feet, dust trailing from his clothes, and stumbled over the edge of the footprint-crater the Gearhulk had left in the pavement. A blast of air pushed him forward as the machine swung its hammer-arm in an underhand arc over his head, crumpling a fleetwheel cruiser and sending it careening down the street. Figures on the makeshift barricade down the block dove to either side. The cruiser smashed through the obstacle in a shriek of torn metal and bounced down the road, shredding scraps of brass and crystal.</p>

<p><em>Well, hoplite, it appears there's a giant mechanical man strolling down the street, malleting parked vehicles through the renegade positions ahead. There are four other giants out there, pressing in. Three on this side, two on the other. You don't know exactly where, though. City streets are canyons, and you're at the bottom of one. Tactically, the worst place to be. Water and fire flow downhill.</em></p>

<p><em>What do you do, Gideon? There are lives at stake, and you're standing in the open like a child in their first sparring match.</em></p>

<p><em>First, you need to understand what's going on.</em></p>

<p>He needed a view from high ground. It would take too long to get to a roof. The front line would have moved on. If Ajani were here, <em>he'd</em> be able to—</p>

<p><em>Focus on the possible.</em></p>

<p>The Gearhulk <em>was</em> the front line, and it towered over the roofs. He sprinted after it, timing the shudders of its ponderous footfalls. There were rungs leading up one of its legs, for maintenance or inspections.</p>

<p>He picked his rung, leapt—</p>

<p>—and missed—</p>

<p>—and barely had time to slap his hands around the next one down, fingers shining gold against the sting of it.</p>

<p>The Gearhulk's leg swung forward, leaving him dangling in midair, heels dragging in the dust.</p>

<p>Jace would have planned this better. <em>Chandra</em> could have planned this better.</p>

<p>With ponderous creaks, the Gearhulk settled its weight on the leg. It tilted up beneath him. He barely had time to get his feet under him.</p>

<p>It was a scramble to reach the machine's waist, pausing once more to simply hold on as the massive leg swung out from underneath him.</p>

<p>Four streets to the left, a dual-headed Gearhulk with tubes for arms was hosing down a crowd of renegades with jets of water. A wave of faceless, armored inspectors passed in its wake, swirling around the protestors blown off their feet, truncheons rising and falling with scarcely contained enthusiasm. Dazed and bloodied bodies were shoved back toward oversized prison transport vans.</p>

<p>A crew of three renegades scrambled across a roof as the water Gearhulk passed. They hurriedly set up a tubular device on a tripod at the edge of the roof. With a muffled thump, it rammed a spear through the thing's arm. For a moment, as they hesitated, the Gearhulk's operator's raised the arm to inspect the damage.</p>

<p>The arm burst open, water gushing in all directions. The harpoon crew scrambled away.</p>

<p>Looking across the collapsing renegade lines, Gideon could see the other two Gearhulks, far closer than he liked, hulls dotted with a barrage of popping explosions, lightning bolts, and flame jets. As he watched, a thopter hastily draped in renegade blues swerved in at one of them and drove itself into the shoulder mechanism. The monster's arms shuddered to a halt in mid-swing. Of the thopter pilot, there was no sign.</p>

<p>A gigantic bug landed on Gideon's shoulder.</p>

<p>He nearly fell off the ladder before he registered that it was wrought of brass and colored silk. "Hallo!" a tinny female voice piped from it. "You're 'Beefslab,' yes?"</p>

<p>"Uh..."</p>

<p>"'White Cat' said that wasn't your codename, but 'Night Queen' was <em>quite</em> insistent it should be."</p>

<p>He looked past the metal insect. Far below, a dark-skinned elf waved from the street, hand held before her lips, a twin metal butterfly clinging to her wrist. She pointed to it, lips moving.</p>

<p>"Just talk into Mr. Wiggles," his butterfly echoed, crackling.</p>

<p>"Hello?" he said carefully, waving down to her. The metal insect waggled its antennae.</p>

<p>"Yes, hallo! Call me 'Shadowblayde.' Spelled with a <em>y</em>, thank you ever so much I'm sure." Gideon was clinging to the waist of a giant mechanical man, but this conversation had quickly become the most surreal thing to happen today. "With 'Cloak Boy' away, I'm running communications."</p>

<p>"Where's Liliana?" he asked the butterfly.</p>

<p>"<em>Night Queen</em>," Shadowblayde's voice said, firmly.</p>

<p>Three streets to the right, one of the other Gearhulks staggered. The living greenwood tree forming its spine shriveled, blackened. Explosive growths of pale fungus spotted its bark.</p>

<p>"Never mind," he said. "I found her."</p>

<p>The machine fell to one knee, keening like a wounded bear as the wood rotted away. Unsupported metal caved in on itself. Brackish liquid ran from every joint.</p>

<p>Liliana appeared on a rooftop in a flourish of dark silks, planted one high-laced boot on the parapet, and raised a gloved hand over her head. She snapped her fingers, and the Gearhulk fell to pieces at her feet.</p>

<p>A roar of delight went up from the renegades on the street. She curtseyed, ostentatiously, and blew a kiss to the crowd.</p>

<p>"Out of curiosity, did Lili—did Night Queen choose all our codenames?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. She was ever so helpful."</p>

<p>"That's...great." The Gearhulk shifted unexpectedly, groaning as the torso rotated. He ducked under a passing pipe and leaned out to see what was ahead.</p>

<p>It was approaching another parked vehicle, raising its hammer-arm to knock it toward the renegades down the street.</p>

<p>The crowds fleeing the water Gearhulk were piled up in front of the barricade now, fleeing through the hole left by the fleetwheel cruiser, the wave of faceless Consulate inspectors pressing them into the line of fire.</p>

<p>It would smash through them.</p>

<p><em>What are you going to do about it, hoplite?</em></p>

<p>He looked around the surfaces of the Gearhulk. Solid metal. No obvious mechanisms or weak points, save for the junction where the legs met the torso. There was a large gap between the armor plates, allowing the limbs to move. Within, he could see massive toothed gears whirling and grinding by the aetherblue light of power tubing.</p>

<p>He looked at his sural. Then back at the spinning gears.</p>

<p>To the mechanical butterfly, he said, "You're going to want to get Mr. Wiggles in the air."</p>

<p>"Right," the speaker squawked. A few whistled notes came through, and the insect fluttered off.</p>

<p>He looked into the gap between the armor, took a few rapid breaths, and dropped into the gears. The darkness flooded with golden light.</p>

<p>For too long, there was pain, noise, and motion.</p>

<p>Metal shrieked, the world jumped upward.</p>

<p>Falling sideways in golden darkness, a thousand tiny knives gnawing his legs and arms, pressing into his spine, filling his mouth with the tang of copper.</p>

<p>His head slammed into a wall.</p>

<p>Stillness.</p>

<p>Breaths echoed in the dark.</p>

<p>So...he was still breathing?</p>

<p>A portion of the darkness lifted away. Warm brilliance flooded his stinging eyes. <em>Chandra..?</em></p>

<p>A grinning face eclipsed the sun. "Who's a big hero?" Shadowblayde-with-a-<em>y</em>.</p>

<p>She peeled him from a smoking tomb, the shattered remains of finely-wrought gears cascading off him as he stood. His breastplate, bent and punctured, swung from one shoulder strap for a moment, then clattered to the road.</p>

<p>The Gearhulk lay sprawled across the road, collapsed face-first in a building. The leg he'd just crawled out of had been shorn off. A legion of teenagers and mechanical creatures swarmed over the wreck, yanking out handfuls of salvage, trading bits and bobs among themselves.</p>

<p>"Found 'em, Miss Blayde!" a vedalken boy called, waving a six-fingered hand. Behind him, the war machine's operators climbed out of a hatch, a team of dour-looking dwarves in oil-stained Consulate uniforms.</p>

<p>"Brilliant work, Beefslab," Shadowblayde grinned, slapping him on one bare, bruised shoulder. "How many more times can you do that?"</p>

<p>Gideon looked across the streets at the three remaining Gearhulks, the sky full of ships. "Not enough."</p>

<p>Liliana swished up, looked him slowly up and down, and languidly placed one hand on her hip. "...I see you lost your shirt."</p>

<p>His eyes were drawn to a flock of Consulate thopters approaching the upper platforms of the Aether Hub, wheeling and circling like...</p>

<p>The next breath came in tight, lightheaded, like the last one before your head sinks underwater.</p>

<p><em>...like harpies over Akros.</em></p>

<p>"Get back to the Hub!" he shouted, breaking into a run. "<em>Double time!</em>"</p>

<hr />
<p>I'm gonna kill him.</p>

<p>Tripping over stones. Curbs. Shoulder throbbing. Stomach cramping.</p>

<p>Stumbling. Knees and palms scraped raw. Back up! Go!</p>

<p>Not getting away. Never. Bastard.</p>

<p>World's a tunnel. Dark except for the circling thopter. Laughter echoes from it. Words.</p>

<p>Mommy. Daddy. <em>Monster</em>. Dead. Suffer. Murder. <em>Monster</em>. Village. Fire. Children. <em>Monster</em>.</p>

<p>I don't hear them anymore. Can't assemble them into thoughts. Just sounds. Just <em>kindling</em>.</p>

<p>No tears left. Just fire, cold and white. Purifying.</p>

<p>I'll burn the rot from him. From this whole city.</p>

<p>"Chandra, let me." Nissa, breathless at my back.</p>

<p>She shouldn't be here. Shouldn't see me like this.</p>

<p>A massive root lifts from the ground in front of us, stretching up to the roof. The thopter settles ahead there, cackling.</p>

<p>I scramble up, cold dirt caking my burning fingers, boots sliding on damp wood. Raw fingers claw the edge of the roof, leaving bloody prints.</p>

<p>The sky is gigantic, and full of ships. The streets are on fire.</p>

<p>Metal giants wade through the flames, crowds fleeing before them. Thopters buzz in blackfly clouds, whirling around the Aether Hub. The upper decks loom over us.</p>

<p>Where mom is.</p>

<p>The thopters are landing there. Cracks and flashes. Figures running. Dropping.</p>

<p>...mom?</p>

<p>"Look. What. You. <em>Did</em>."</p>

<p>Baral, his ruined face split with a shatter-toothed grin. The lifting thopter blows grit into my eyes. "Maybe it would have been different if you'd been there." Sun gleams on the edge of his blade. He angles it into my face. "Or maybe...<em>more</em> of them would be dead."</p>

<p>I feel the hair lifting off my scalp. Scalding, frigid light floods the roof.</p>

<p>"You're not exactly <em>accurate</em>, after all. Are you, <em>monster?</em>"</p>

<p>"Screw you," I whisper, and blow his face off.</p>

<p>My wall of white fire twirls away in the wind, scattering into flicks of candle flame.</p>

<p>"Don't you get tired of that?" He lowers one glowing hand, and drops the visor of his helmet. "Even dogs know more tricks."</p>

<p>The roof quakes. From one side, Nissa's elemental thunders, leaps—</p>

<p>—and falls in a tumble of debris, black earth and gray stone, white wood and green leaves. Baral flicks a clod of soil off his shoulder with one glowing hand. "This is Ghirapur. Don't bring mud to a bot fight."</p>

<p>A wave of metal heaves up behind him and floods the roof. Brass wheels and steel legs, flame jet nozzles and sparking antennae.</p>

<p>"Find peace," Nissa murmurs, her hand a warmth passing across my shoulders, there and gone.</p>

<p>Then she's midair, stabbing a thin blade through the optics of one automaton, rolling, jabbing an elbow into another, crunching a third with the heel of her hiking boot, slashing, jabbing. A windborne blossom of singing green steel and hard, sure muscle. Like she'd only been touching the ground as a courtesy.</p>

<p>Wait.</p>

<p>Hold up.</p>

<p>This is crazy.</p>

<p>Nissa has a <em>sword?</em></p>

<p>The bottom end of her staff rolls across the roof and thumps against my toes.</p>

<p>I blink, and Baral's in my face, swinging.</p>

<p>Left, right, crap, blast, stumble, back, back!</p>

<p>Sharp sunlight. Ice lashes my arm.</p>

<p>Stagger. On my knees. A puddle on the rooftop. A ripple of silver, red fractals exploding. I see his sword coming down on me, as an echo.</p>

<p>Roll!</p>

<p>Wind passes my ear.</p>

<p>I shove power into the puddle, and it explodes into a cloud. The dim figure of him snarls and staggers back, waving it away from his face.</p>

<p>I know what to do.</p>

<p>The roof sealant liquefies into steaming tar. He roars in pain, blade cutting ahead through the clouds.</p>

<p>Thopter-wing stutter overhead. Thunder cracks. Is Nissa all right? Where is—?</p>

<p>I recoil from sudden cloud-shadow. Stinging needles of ice rake across my brow.</p>

<p>Reflex, a firebolt back in the same direction. A blue pulse dissolves it into sparks.</p>

<p>He limps through the tar, laughing. The left half of the world dissolves into a smear of red. I swipe at it, but it doesn't go away. Just makes my hand slippery.</p>

<p>His blade is white from the air around me. Breath echoes from the filigree of his helmet.</p>

<p>The building rattles beneath us. He grunts and sways, but keeps coming. Far behind him, dad's ship rises alongside the Aether Hub, trailing torn boarding gantries and snapped anchor lines.</p>

<p>There's not enough air. Can't get enough. I'm staggering, wheezing. Have we been fighting hours? Minutes?</p>

<p>I pitch flames with my left hand. As he dispels it, I punch his stupid face with my right.</p>

<p>His stupid <em>metal-covered</em> face. I scream at the crunch.</p>

<p>"Idiot monster," he mutters, and kicks. Hard.</p>

<p>Pain explodes from my gut.</p>

<p>I retch into hot, stinking slime, struggling to inhale, every breath another endless agony. I'm not crying because <em>screw that guy.</em></p>

<p>I need to get up.</p>

<p>He limps over, rasping, boots splashed black and steaming. He reeks of Innistrad in the aftermath, mounds of burning, lurid, warped flesh.</p>

<p>The air won't come. Nissa. Help.</p>

<p>Raises the sword.</p>

<p>I crawl. Help. Nissa.</p>

<p>The blade falls. I want to look away. I want to <em>move</em>.</p>

<p>CLANG.</p>

<p>I crack an eyelid to raining brass. A filigree bird, dented and shorn like my neck isn't. It rolls across the roof, scattering gears. Its whistles turn to sighs, then silence.</p>

<p>"Stay away from that child, you <em>son of a donkey!</em>" Mrs. Pashiri thunders.</p>

<p>I raise myself on trembling, bloody arms. She's on the Hub, a platform across from us, shaking her fist at Baral. Ajani's beside her, axe in hands, ears flat back and his good eye dilated into one enormous dead-black orb.</p>

<p>I can only puff weakly, sparks falling from my eyes.</p>

<p>The crowds on the Hub are running to <em>Heart of Kiran</em>'s gaping hatches. Half-fitted turrets spark and crack at ranks of faceless inspectors. Consulate thopters drop gleaming aerial torpedoes, coughing to life on wide contrails of hissing exhaust.</p>

<p>"Gunner!" Baral bellows up to his thopter, tossing aside his ruined blade. "Take out the lifecrafter!"</p>

<p>There's a shriek in my head and maybe I let it out because he turns back to me, I'm on my feet and everything's going bright blue-white, moonlight on a mirror, cloudless desert sky, and I send streams of eyestrain-bright flame up at the blurring wings and glinting brass—</p>

<p>Baral's hands close around my fists.</p>

<p>Everything stops. Magic dies.</p>

<p>"Look what you did," he shouts in my face. "<em>Watch!</em>" Mana is all around, but I can't grab it. It wriggles like oil on water. I reach, and his hands make it slip away. He tries to bend my arms, to break me. "Even daddy knew. When I shoved the blade under his ribs. I saw it in his eyes as he bled out. The <em>shame</em> of you."</p>

<p>Forks of cracking white light stab at Hub.</p>

<p>Ajani is spitting rage, swinging as Mrs. Pashiri stumbles away from the rail. The thopter-lightning bounces away from his blades. Once. Twice.</p>

<p>"That's the face," Baral grins. His breath smells of cheap vendor meat and too much sugared chai, weeks of meals alone. My arms strain against him. "<em>Despair</em>. Just like when I had you in the arena, monster. My blade on your little neck."</p>

<p>The third crack shatters the world.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pashiri seizes and topples, smoke-colored braids flying apart.</p>

<p>He laughs. "Is there <em>anyone</em> you haven't killed?"</p>

<p>Somehow my bloody hands are at his throat, finding the gaps in the metal and pushing through, squeezing as hard as I can, digging in the ragged nails, bloody thumbs pressing into the bulge. I think I'm screaming. My throat is raw.</p>

<p>He slams his gauntleted hands against the sides of my head over and over, until I'm falling down a tunnel with only sparks at the end.</p>

<p>When I can hear something besides my heart, a tin voice is booming, "...under arrest for conspiracy, treason, and assault. Get on your knees and put your hands behind your head."</p>

<p>Baral's gagging and spitting into the congealing tar, straining to pull in air.</p>

<p>Overheard, a Consulate airship, a dozen cannons swiveling down at me.</p>

<p>I screwed up. Again. Everything is burning.</p>

<p>"Chandra." Nissa is beside me, leaning on her blade. She's scorched and bleeding, her braid half-undone. Pulse-glowing shards of hot metal sizzle in the unbound waves. Jade spills from her eyes as she looks at me, trembling fingers hovering over the gash in my head.</p>

<p>"You need to go now," I rasp, and get to my feet.</p>

<p>I'm not a monster.</p>

<p>But I can be.</p>

<p>I gather the air, set it alight, and <em>squeeze</em>. Between my hands, sparks ignite, blazing golden fish swarming. They shudder, frantic, turning arsenic-white. Like I've done a thousand times before.</p>

<p>Baral tips his dented helmet back. It clatters across the roof. He's smiling. "I killed your daddy, renegade," he says. "I killed your <em>auntie</em>."</p>

<p>The wind's growing. More air. More heat. Pin it down. Press until it can't move. Until all the breath is gone. I grit my teeth. My light is arctic now, throwing sharp blue shadows.</p>

<p>"And now I'm going to kill you." He pulls a dagger from his sash. A simple dagger, with old stains on the blade and a charred grip. "And the best part, the absolute <em>best</em> part, is that there's nothing you can do about it."</p>

<p>It's so easy. I should've thought of it before. We tried it in Baral's trap but I was too upset. Now everything's clear. Blank, flat, and desperately clear.</p>

<p>"There <em>is</em> something I can do," I tell him.</p>

<p>I can make amends. For Mrs. Pashiri. For dad. For mom. For the old women and little kids I killed in the Sanctum of Stars. For a lifetime of screwing up. All the awful things I've done. All the people I failed. The air between my hands is packed with stars, vibrating, superheated. Streaks of light scratch through my vision.</p>

<p>"...Something I can <em>always</em> do..."</p>

<p>I can take out Baral. The ships and the Gearhulks. Tezzeret and the Consuls. I could take out all of Ghirapur, if I want. It's so <em>easy</em>. I just have to bottle it up, and release. I just have to <em>let go</em>.</p>

<p>Because it doesn't matter anymore, does it? Everything's ruined.</p>

<p>Let it go.</p>

<p>Close your eyes.</p>

<p>Let it happen.</p>

<p>Let it be over.</p>

<p>Doesn't matter.</p>

<p>I close my aching eyes on Kaladesh, and whisper, "...I can <em>burn</em>."</p>

<p>Arms from behind. The scent of flowers, and a soft wind at my ear. "But not alone."</p>

<p>Nissa?</p>

<p>"I'll hurt you. Let me go."</p>

<p>Her arms squeeze tighter. "<em>No</em>."</p>

<p>"I can't do this anymore. Let me go." My stars burn the tears away, but my voice is high and wavering, the words tumbling over each other as I start to shudder. I'm falling apart. "Please just let me go."</p>

<p>"I can't. If you leave us like this, you'll have to take me too."</p>

<p>"That's not—" I can't see anything now. There's just light, and her voice.</p>

<p>"Don't go," she says.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pashiri spasms and falls, her braids in a tangle, eyes locked on me, willing me to run for safety. Dad crumples, hands clamped over the red hole in his stomach, eyes locked on me, willing me to run for safety. Dead because of me.</p>

<p>"Don't leave us," Nissa says, softly. "You're loved."</p>

<p>The sucking wind between my hands is pulling a sea from my eyes. Sparks, embers, wobbling saltwater.</p>

<p>I stop adding power. I stop squeezing. The stars slip and shiver between my hands. The light ripples, silver-blue sparks buzzing like angry flies, hissing like oil in a skillet.</p>

<p>Something's wrong.</p>

<p>The fire's gone strange. It's still getting hotter, collapsing inward. It's burning on its own, burning <em>itself</em>, without anything from me. I blink, and scratches of light claw through the brief dark.</p>

<p>It's still growing.</p>

<p>I bleed off the heat, careful, slow, but it snaps at me, eager to escape the trap I've made. A wisp of impossibly hot flame jets free. I clamp it down, press my hands close to the raging blue light. Baral gasps. Somewhere nearby, there's the shudder and grind of buildings crashing down.</p>

<p>"I can't do it," I pant. My heart's slamming against my bruised ribs. "It's wrong. It won't slow down."</p>

<p>"Chandra," she says. "Remember what it feels like to swim? You told me on Ravnica. Describe it to me again. Tell me how it felt to float. Just blue and air above you. Everything cool and still...?"</p>

<p>I close my eyes and I'm ten years old. The air is broiling and thick, too hot to sleep. Mom and dad are sprawled across the grass together, breathing slow, still touching in sleep despite the summer heat. I slip away and crawl down the mossy rocks. I slide in backward, and the water crawls through my frizzy hair, cool against my sweaty scalp. My throat constricts.</p>

<p>"There—there was a quarry we'd go to. Overgrown. Green all over. At night I'd go out and float. The stars would reflect in the water. White and blue and orange. Patches of green and rose, like ghosts far away. The ripples would echo off the rocks. The sound of my breaths would keep coming back, keep getting smaller. Like I was falling away from everything. If I laid still enough, it was like...I was in the middle of them. Like I was floating between stars."</p>

<p>"There's a lantern on the water, among the stars. It's the brightest thing you can see. Can you imagine that?"</p>

<p>One pure white torch, burning straight and true, casting painful angles of ice-shine across shadowed rocks. "Yes."</p>

<p>"That flame is growing smaller," Nissa whispers, like wind through leaves. "It's night. It's time for earthbound lights to dim. To let stars and ghosts illuminate. The water is lapping against you. It's cool on your skin. The light is fading."</p>

<p>The savage brilliance beyond my lids is dimming. I'm floating, eyes closed. When I breathe I catch the scents of pine and night flowers from her hair. I'm swaying. A light bobbing on stilling waters. Warm arms across my stomach keep me from drifting away.</p>

<p>"You're a lantern on the water," Nissa says, as she rocks me side to side, rolling my shoulders like spring tide. "But just a little one. A tiny flame, flickering in the night. Can you feel it? You're drifting. A precious light on endless water. And the stars are waiting for you."</p>

<p>The light flickers, and goes out.</p>

<hr />
<p>Baral swore as the Nalaar girl collapsed back into the elf's arms. One of her eyes was bloodshot and sunken with fatigue, the other sealed with dried blood from the sword gash he'd left across her forehead. Her cheeks were sunburnt and tear-streaked.</p>

<p>"I can't stand up," she said, her voice thready and hoarse from screaming. "My legs...it's like Zendikar."</p>

<p>"Then I'll carry you," the elf said.</p>

<p>He'd almost had her. Wind up a monster until it's frantic with pain and fear, sure enough it will bite its own leg off. He'd made a hundred mages fall to pieces in the cells of the Dhund, in the forgotten dark where no one else knew to interfere.</p>

<p>"Fine." He limped toward them, favoring the leg she'd seared. Sometimes you just had to get your hands dirty. Like father, like daughter. He tightened his grip on the stained old blade. "All you have is fire. If you're not willing to burn, what are you going to do?" he sneered. <em>"Punch</em> me again?"</p>

<p>A tree slammed into him from the left.</p>

<p>Metal bars cracked across his chest, and something splintered.</p>

<p>He blinked away stars. Breath became a painful chore.</p>

<p>He was crumpled against the guardrail at the edge of the roof. On the far side, the elf now held the girl limp across her arms. Over them both towered her reconstituted elemental beast, flicking blood off a root-fist the size of a thopter. It shook itself, and the leaves on its back hissed like a furious tiger.</p>

<p>"<em>Leave</em>," the elf said coldly, and turned away.</p>

<p>The roar of the thopter descended behind him.</p>

<p>Boots clustered around his head.</p>

<p>Baan's voice came over the thrum of wings, precise and clinically distant. "Multiple broken ribs and a hairline fracture of the collarbone. Mild concussion. Damage to the trachea and larynx. Second degree burns on the back, face, and feet. Third degree burns across the left leg. A stretcher, if you please, inspectors." A chorus of guttural acknowledgements as Baral's squad snapped to.</p>

<p>Baan squatted beside his head, careful to keep his shoes clear of the blood. "This is why I insist on the proper installation of safety features. If that rail had not been there—"</p>

<p>"Shut up!" Baral snarled, then huffed out a shallow, helpless breath at the agony in his chest.</p>

<p>Baan's eyes narrowed, and he inhaled sharply. "Chief Baral," he said, crisply. "Your reports from twelve years ago claimed that Miss Nalaar and her parents died in an incident of arson, with her as the culpable party. According to your statements today—which I have recorded with <em>scrupulous</em> precision—you took Kiran Nalaar's life yourself, imprisoned Pia Nalaar without a trial, then attempted to turn their daughter's execution into some form of...arena event."</p>

<p>"The Nalaars were aether smugglers. The girl destroyed a foundry."</p>

<p>"Crimes for which they should have been tried and justly punished. However, neither are capital offenses."</p>

<p>"Damn you, Baan, she's a pyromancer!"</p>

<p>"She is a <em>citizen</em>."</p>

<p>"A monster!" he barked, and was left breathless by the words. "All mages are monsters," he whispered to the sky.</p>

<p>Baan sighed and tented his fingers, forearms resting across his knees. His face was grave, stained with nauseating pity. "Chief Inspector Dhiren Baral, I charge you with one count of murder—possibly with more yet to be uncovered—and one count of <em>attempted</em> murder. I charge you with one count of extrajudicial incarceration—again, possibly with more to be revealed. Finally, I charge you with multiple counts of falsification of the public record, with the express intention of obscuring your crimes.</p>

<p>"You are a disgrace to your uniform, and a disquieting aberration to the ideals the Consulate espouses. Though I personally find your offenses...vexing in the extreme, the law requires that even <em>you</em> must be judged in court. Be aware that your every statement from this point forward shall be entered into the official record as evidence."</p>

<p>"They're escaping," Baral rasped. "The elf and the pyromancer. You have to finish them."</p>

<p>Baan tilted his head. "Incorrect. Our mission is complete and successful. The Aether Hub has been regained. The remainder of our detachment shall now redeploy to defend it against the likely counterattack. Will you come with me under arrest, or shall I leave you to engage in further pugilism with the shrubbery?"</p>

<p>The air flooded out of him. That was it, then. He lay back and looked at the towering clouds. "I won't forget this, Baan."</p>

<p>"Excellent. I do not care to repeat myself."</p>

<hr />
<p>Gideon knelt and turned his back to her. "Climb up."</p>

<p>"You don't have to do this." Her voice was smaller than he'd ever heard it, low and lifeless.</p>

<p>"It's not a problem, Chandra. Big shoulders, you know. Plenty of room." He hoped it sounded as cheerful as he wanted it to.</p>

<p>Her weight settled across his upper back. He inhaled quickly and quietly as knees and elbows fell across the bruises on his torso. He snugged his forearms under her bare knees as thin arms encircled his shoulders. All her fingertips were burnt, her palms and knuckles wrapped with stained bandages. The forearms beneath his chin were laced with ugly cuts from flying steel and glass.</p>

<p>"All set?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Sure," she mumbled.</p>

<p>"<em>Up</em> we go," he grunted, staggering to his feet. She didn't weigh much, not really. He was just...sore. The throbbing fever-heat of her felt good against the bright red bruises hidden under his shirt.</p>

<p>He carried her down the halls of the abandoned apartment building. Crumbling, mold-damp walls were strung with erratic constellations of aetherblue light capsules.</p>

<p><em>Heart of Kiran</em> had carried the escapees from the Aether Hub to the safety of Weldfast, solidly renegade territory. It now hung impossibly over a wide road, between tall and shambling steel workshops. Cars and trains passed under its bulk as welders in sling rigs cut away and replaced sections of damaged armor plate. A constant background din of thunder cracks from makeshift flak cannons warded away the Consulate skyships. At least it wasn't "The Gremlin's Wedding March."</p>

<p>A group of renegades were clustered in the hall ahead, whispering.</p>

<p>"...everything went wrong when the daughter..."</p>

<p>"...don't know things would have been different..."</p>

<p>"...hasn't Renegade Prime suffered enough?"</p>

<p>"...heard she watched it all from the Hub..."</p>

<p>They looked up as he approached, and fell falteringly silent under his glare. Chandra buried her face between his shoulders, arms squeezing tight, warm shudders of breath rolling down the back of his shirt.</p>

<p>They turned into the stairway, leaving the group behind. Halfway down, she pulled one hand back and traced warm fingers across his shoulders with a lightness, a gentleness, that made all the many hairs on his arms stand up. "Do you have these everywhere? The bruises, I mean? You look like you fell down a flight of punches."</p>

<p>He laughed shortly, for his own benefit as much as for hers, the echoes off it scattering forlornly up and down the stairs. "Afraid so."</p>

<p>"I thought you were indestructible."</p>

<p>"I had to get creative. But I'm here, so technically I'm still not...uh, destruct-abled." He turned in to the next floor down, what passed for a healer's quarter.</p>

<p>"I don't think that's a word."</p>

<p>"I'm sure Jace has six dictionaries memorized. When Captain Zev returns him, we'll ask." He nodded to the renegade minding the door ahead, who pulled it open for them.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pashiri lay on a sagging bed, hands clasped at her stomach, eyes closed, drawn and pale...but breathing. Ajani sat beside her, one massive hand covering both of hers, head bowed in concentration. A faint aura of silver light surrounded them both, ripples of power flowing from him to her.</p>

<p>Chandra shuddered at the sight. "I can't—I can't do this," she whispered. "Take me back, Gids."</p>

<p>Ajani's light faded. He looked up and studied her, inhaling quietly through his nose. "You're quite ill, Chandra," he said.</p>

<p>"What? I don't feel—"</p>

<p>"You will, very soon. The damage is subtle, but widespread. And serious. You and Nissa both need care. Gideon, you'll bring them later?"</p>

<p>He nodded. Chandra opened her mouth, but closed it without a word, and looked away. Nissa had carried her halfway across the city to the Weldfast, running most of the way, silent and watchful for Consulate inspectors. After handing her to Gideon, the elf had staggered to a spot of sunlit grass and collapsed into exhausted sleep.</p>

<p>Ajani stood and indicated the chair. "Please sit. She was asking for you earlier."</p>

<p>Gideon dropped to one knee before the chair, and she slid back into it. Her hand trembled in the air over Mrs. Pashiri's hands. "Is she...?"</p>

<p>"Grandmother will be fine, in time. She will not be slain while I am present." Ajani paused and studied her. "This was not your fault, Chandra."</p>

<p>She looked away to the far wall. "I...I know that."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," he said. "It is to be hoped that you do. But you still need to <em>hear</em> it."</p>

<p>Her hand touched down on Mrs. Pashiri's. "Would you like us to leave?" Gideon said.</p>

<p>Chandra's fingers curled around the older woman's. "I nearly got her killed today. Again. I haven't even been home two months, and I almost killed her twice." Tears swelled in her eyes, pulsing with the beat of her heart. "She covered for me the day I ran. Did I ever say? Let me hide in the place she worked. Distracted Baral and his men. And I never even asked her what happened when I got back. Like, did they put her in jail with mom?"</p>

<p>"No," Ajani rumbled. "She went free. When your mother was released, they—"</p>

<p>"But I never <em>asked!</em>" she snarled, slamming a fist into her own knee. She wobbled to her feet, took a step toward the door, and collapsed. Ajani caught her with one arm. "Damn it!" she said, through gritted teeth. "I can't even—I just...I wanna <em>leave</em>. I shouldn't be here. I don't deserve—"</p>

<p>A door slammed at the far end of the hallway. She looked up and gasped.</p>

<p>Mrs. Nalaar was walking towards them at a brisk pace, eyes fixed and piercing, scraps of old, water-crumpled paper flipping and swaying in her wake, smoke-streaked hair trailing behind her.</p>

<p>Gideon slid beside Chandra and let her grab his forearm. "I have her," he murmured to Ajani. The leonin nodded and withdrew.</p>

<p>"I screwed up," she whispered. "I always do. She's mad and she's got every right. I'm the worst, Gids. I don't know why you're even holding me off the floor."</p>

<p>Three unfair, uncertain, unforgivable words resonated in Gideon's mind. Words that, once loosed, couldn't be taken back.</p>

<p>"Talk to her," he said instead.</p>

<p>Chandra straightened as best she could, one trembling hand clamped tight around his arm, supporting her weight. She didn't look up, but watched the feet approaching.</p>

<p>"<em>Child</em>," Mrs. Nalaar said, in a voice high and tight as a lyre string.</p>

<p>"Mom, I—"</p>

<p>Mrs. Nalaar swept her into a fierce embrace, staggering her backward. "I can't lose you again." Her voice had gone husky and quavering. A small plaintive sound escaped Chandra.</p>

<p>She pulled back and looked Chandra in the eye, cupping dark hands on sunburnt cheeks, pressing her forehead to her daughter's as tears rolled across the old grief-lines etched in her face. "Do you hear me? I <em>can't</em>. It would break me. <em>I love you</em>."</p>

<p>Chandra's eyes spilled. "If you start crying, I'll start crying," she sobbed, the corners of her mouth crumpling.</p>

<p>Gideon closed the door behind him, ground the heels of his hands into his own stinging eyes, and glanced at Ajani. "Mrs. Pashiri will be all right?"</p>

<p>He'd never gotten the knack of reading leonin expressions, but it seemed as if the other man smiled. "Hearing this is better healing than anything magic offers."</p>

<p>"But she's unconscious."</p>

<p>Ajani's tail swayed horizontally, dismissively. "Truer things are sometimes heard in sleep."</p>

<p>A clatter of boots stormed down the hallway; a crowd of renegades in ersatz uniforms, arguing among themselves about checklists, ordnance, and positions. Gideon and Ajani exchanged wry looks, then imperceptible shrugs, then arranged themselves in front of the door, arms folded, broad shoulders blocking any access.</p>

<p>The dwarf in the lead had the harried look of a clerk. "We need to talk to Renegade Prime, immediately," the man grumped. "It's urge—"</p>

<p>Gideon silenced him with one hand and a shake of his head. "In just ten minutes."</p>

<p>The Release Notes include information concerning the release of a new <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> set, as well as a collection of clarifications and rulings involving that set's cards. They are intended to make playing with the new cards more fun by clearing up the common misconceptions and confusion inevitably caused by new mechanics and interactions. As future sets are released, updates to the <em>Magic</em> rules may cause some of this information to become outdated. Go to <a href="http://magic.wizards.com/rules" target="_blank">Magic.Wizards.com/Rules</a> to find the most up-to-date rules.</p>

<p>The "General Notes" section includes information about card legality and explains some of the mechanics and concepts in the set.</p>

<p>The "Card-Specific Notes" sections contain answers to the most important, most common, and most confusing questions players might ask about cards in the set. Items in the "Card-Specific Notes" sections include full card text for your reference. Not all cards in the set are listed.</p>

<hr />
<h2>GENERAL NOTES</h2>

<h3>Card Legality</h3>

<p>The <em>Dominaria</em> <em>Remastered </em>set becomes legal for sanctioned Limited play on its official release date: January 13, 2023. Cards in this release are legal for Constructed play in any format that already allows them; that is, appearing in <em>Dominaria Remastered</em> doesn't change a card's legality in any format. Notably, many of these cards are not legal in the Standard and Pioneer formats.</p>

<p>Go to <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/Commander" target="_blank">Magic.Wizards.com/Commander</a> for more information on the Commander variant.</p>

<hr />
<h3>Returning Abilities</h3>

<p><em>Dominaria Remastered </em>features several returning keywords and other mechanics. A few of the more prevalent ones are included in this section, while others will have rulings in the "Card-Specific Notes" section below. The rules for these mechanics are unchanged in this release, although some rules have changed since cards featuring these mechanics were first printed.</p>

<hr />
<h3>Returning Keyword: Flashback</h3>

<p>Flashback's back. Back again. Flashback gives some instants and sorceries in the graveyard one more chance to wreak some havoc.</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/dmr/en_04d92ba319.png" /></p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;">Call of the Herd<br />
{2}{G}<br />
Sorcery<br />
Create a 3/3 green Elephant creature token.<br />
Flashback {3}{G} <em>(You may cast this card from your graveyard for its flashback cost. Then exile it.)</em></p>

<ul>
	<li>"Flashback [cost]" means "You may cast this card from your graveyard by paying [cost] rather than paying its mana cost" and "If the flashback cost was paid, exile this card instead of putting it anywhere else any time it would leave the stack."</li>
	<li>You must still follow any timing restrictions and permissions, including those based on the card's type. For example, you can cast a sorcery using flashback only when you could normally cast a sorcery.</li>
	<li>To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost (such as a flashback cost) you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions. The mana value of the spell is determined only by its mana cost, no matter what the total cost to cast the spell was.</li>
	<li>A spell cast using flashback will always be exiled afterward, regardless of whether it resolves, is countered, or leaves the stack in some other way.</li>
	<li>You can cast a card using flashback even if it was somehow put into your graveyard without having been cast.</li>
	<li>If a card with flashback is put into your graveyard during your turn, you can cast it if it's legal to do so before any other player can take any actions.</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<h3>Returning Keyword: Madness</h3>

<p>Discarding cards is often an opportunity lost. You could have cast that card! With madness, you can have your cake and water it too. Or something.</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/dmr/en_b38e6e0da7.png" /></p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;">Dark Withering<br />
{4}{B}{B}<br />
Instant<br />
Destroy target nonblack creature.<br />
Madness {B} <em>(If you discard this card, discard it into exile. When you do, cast it for its madness cost or put it into your graveyard.)</em></p>

<ul>
	<li>Cards are discarded in a <em>Magic</em> game only from a player's hand. Effects that put cards into a player's graveyard from anywhere else do not cause those cards to be discarded.</li>
	<li>Madness works independently of why you're discarding the card. You could discard it to pay a cost, because a spell or ability tells you to, or because you have too many cards in your hand during your cleanup step. You can't discard a card with madness just because you want to, though.</li>
	<li>A card with madness that's discarded counts as having been discarded even though it's put into exile rather than a graveyard. If it was discarded to pay a cost, that cost is still paid. Abilities that trigger when a card is discarded will still trigger.</li>
	<li>A spell cast for its madness cost is put onto the stack like any other spell. It can be countered, copied, and so on. As it resolves, it's put onto the battlefield if it's a permanent card or into its owner's graveyard if it's an instant or sorcery card.</li>
	<li>Casting a spell with madness ignores the timing rules based on the card's card type. For example, you can cast a sorcery with madness if you discard it during an opponent's turn.</li>
	<li>To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost (such as a madness cost) you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions. The mana value of the spell is determined by only its mana cost, no matter what the total cost to cast that spell was.</li>
	<li>If you choose not to cast a card with madness when the madness triggered ability resolves, it's put into your graveyard. Madness doesn't give you another chance to cast it later.</li>
	<li>If you discard a card with madness to pay the cost of a spell or activated ability, that card's madness triggered ability (and the spell that card becomes, if you choose to cast it) will resolve before the spell or ability the discard paid for.</li>
	<li>If you discard a card with madness while a spell or ability is resolving, it moves immediately to exile. Continue resolving that spell or ability, noting that the card you discarded is not in your graveyard at this time. Its madness triggered ability will be placed onto the stack once that spell or ability has completely resolved.</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<h3>Returning Mechanic: Split Cards</h3>

<p>Split cards offer flexibility by combining two card faces into a single card. You may not have all the answers, but you'll have at least one more answer than you otherwise might have!</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/dmr/en_193eaa336d.png" style="transform:rotate(90deg);" /></p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;">Assault // Battery<br />
{R}<br />
Sorcery<br />
Assault deals 2 damage to any target.<br />
//<br />
Battery<br />
{3}{G}<br />
Sorcery<br />
Create a 3/3 green Elephant creature token.</p>

<ul>
	<li>To cast a split card, choose one of its halves to cast. There's no way to cast both halves of any of the split cards featured in this set.</li>
	<li>Split cards have two card faces on a single card. The characteristics of the half you didn't cast are ignored while the spell is on the stack.</li>
	<li>Each split card is a single card. For example, if you discard a split card, you've discarded one card, not two. If an effect counts the number of sorcery cards in your graveyard, Assault // Battery counts once, not twice.</li>
	<li>Each split card has two names. If an effect instructs you to choose a card name, you may choose one of those names, but not both.</li>
	<li>A split card's characteristics are a combination of its two halves while it is not on the stack. For example, Assault // Battery has a mana value of 5 while it is in your library. If an effect allows you to search your library for a card with mana value 4 or less, you can't find Assault // Battery.</li>
	<li>If an effect allows you to cast a spell with certain characteristics, consider only the characteristics of the half you're casting. For example, if an effect allows you to cast a sorcery spell with mana value 2 or less from among cards in your graveyard, you could cast Assault this way, but not Battery.</li>
</ul>

<h2>CARD-SPECIFIC NOTES</h2>

<p class="rtecenter"><img src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/dmr/en_bd54ba4253.png" /></p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;">Absorb<br />
{W}{U}{U}<br />
Instant<br />
Counter target spell. You gain 3 life.</p>

<ul>
	<li>A spell that can't be countered is a legal target for Absorb. The spell won't be countered when Absorb resolves, but you'll still gain 3 life.</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<p class="rtecenter"><img src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/dmr/en_b24b75e098.png" /></p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;">Aquamoeba<br />
{1}{U}<br />
Creature — Elemental Beast<br />
1/3<br />
Discard a card: Switch Aquamoeba's power and toughness until end of turn.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Effects that switch a creature's power and toughness apply after all other effects, regardless of when those effects began to apply. For example, if Aquamoeba's ability resolves and then you somehow give it +4/+0 later in the turn, it's a 3/5 creature, not a 7/1 creature.</li>
	<li>Because damage remains marked on a creature until the damage is removed as the turn ends, nonlethal damage dealt to a creature may become lethal if you switch its power and toughness during that turn.</li>
	<li>Switching a creature's power and toughness twice (or any even number of times) effectively returns the creature's power and toughness to their values before any switches.</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<p class="rtecenter"><img src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/dmr/en_15413abe73.png" /></p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;">Arboria<br />
{2}{G}{G}<br />
World Enchantment<br />
Creatures can't attack a player unless that player cast a spell or put a nontoken permanent onto the battlefield during their last turn.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Arboria doesn't stop creatures from attacking planeswalkers, regardless of what their controllers did or didn't do during their last turns.</li>
	<li>Arboria's effect cares whether a player put a nontoken permanent onto the battlefield. It's unusual for an ability to care who put a permanent onto the battlefield, as opposed to under whose control it entered.</li>
	<li>Arboria's effect cares about the actions taken by players, not their results. If a player cast a spell during their last turn but that spell was countered, that player may still be attacked. The same is true if a player put a nontoken permanent onto the battlefield during their last turn, but that permanent left the battlefield before their turn ended.</li>
	<li>If two or more permanents have the world supertype, all of them are put into their owners' graveyards except the one that has had the world supertype for the shortest amount of time. If there's a tie for the shortest amount of time, all world permanents are put into the graveyard.</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<p class="rtecenter"><img src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/dmr/en_ad955d2832.png" /></p>

Legendary Creature — Elder Dragon<br />
7/7<br />
Flying<br />
At the beginning of your upkeep, sacrifice Arcades Sabboth unless you pay {G}{W}{U}.<br />
Each untapped creature you control gets +0/+2 as long as it's not attacking.<br />
{W}: Arcades Sabboth gets +0/+1 until end of turn.</p>

<ul>
	<li>As long as Arcades Sabboth is untapped and isn't attacking, it gets +0/+2 from its own third ability.</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<p class="rtecenter"><img src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/dmr/en_ba1d59ffa5.png" /></p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;">Arcanis the Omnipotent<br />
{3}{U}{U}{U}<br />
Legendary Creature — Wizard<br />
3/4<br />
{T}: Draw three cards.<br />
{2}{U}{U}: Return Arcanis the Omnipotent to its owner's hand.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Arcanis's last ability can be activated only while it's on the battlefield.</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<p class="rtecenter"><img src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/dmr/en_8fcda37e1e.png" /></p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;">Battle Screech<br />
{2}{W}{W}<br />
Sorcery<br />
Create two 1/1 white Bird creature tokens with flying.<br />
Flashback—Tap three untapped white creatures you control. <em>(You may cast this card from your graveyard for its flashback cost. Then exile it.)</em></p>

<ul>
	<li>You can tap any untapped white creatures you control to pay for Battle Screech's flashback cost, even ones you haven't controlled continuously since the beginning of your most recent turn.</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<p class="rtecenter"><img src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/dmr/en_4e253d92ba.png" /></p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;">Battlefield Scrounger<br />
{3}{G}{G}<br />
Creature — Centaur<br />
3/3<br />
<em>Threshold</em> — Put three cards from your graveyard on the bottom of your library: Battlefield Scrounger gets +3/+3 until end of turn. Activate only once each turn and only if seven or more cards are in your graveyard.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Check the number of cards in your graveyard before activating the ability. If activating the ability causes that number to fall below seven, the ability still resolves as normal.</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<p class="rtecenter"><img src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/dmr/en_75247f1ae6.png" /></p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;">Body Snatcher<br />
{2}{B}{B}<br />
Creature — Phyrexian Minion<br />
2/2<br />
When Body Snatcher enters the battlefield, exile it unless you discard a creature card.<br />
When Body Snatcher dies, exile it and return target creature card from your graveyard to the battlefield.</p>

<ul>
	<li>You choose whether to discard a card or not as the enters-the-battlefield ability resolves.</li>
	<li>Although you can choose Body Snatcher itself as the target of its last ability, it will be exiled before it can be returned to the battlefield.</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<p class="rtecenter"><img src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/dmr/en_edc6a64f86.png" /></p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;">Chain Lightning<br />
{R}<br />
Sorcery<br />
Chain Lightning deals 3 damage to any target. Then that player or that permanent's controller may pay {R}{R}. If the player does, they may copy this spell and may choose a new target for that copy.</p>

<ul>
	<li>As Chain Lightning resolves, either the original or one of the copies, the targeted player or the controller of the targeted permanent may copy it. The copy has the same text, target, and color as the resolving spell, though the player creating the copy may choose a new target for it. Once that copy is created (or not), the Chain Lightning finishes resolving and leaves the stack.</li>
	<li>The player putting the copy of the spell on the stack controls that copy.</li>
	<li>The copy of Chain Lightning is created on the stack, so it's not cast. Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger. Players may respond to that spell before it resolves.</li>
	<li>If the targeted player or permanent is an illegal target as Chain Lightning tries to resolve, the spell doesn't resolve and none of its effects happen. It can't be copied.</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<p class="rtecenter"><img src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/dmr/en_7169928d2e.png" /></p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;">Chainer, Dementia Master<br />
{3}{B}{B}<br />
Legendary Creature — Human Minion<br />
3/3<br />
All Nightmares get +1/+1.<br />
{B}{B}{B}, Pay 3 life: Put target creature card from a graveyard onto the battlefield under your control. That creature is black and is a Nightmare in addition to its other creature types.<br />
When Chainer, Dementia Master leaves the battlefield, exile all Nightmares.</p>

<ul>
	<li>The creature put onto the battlefield by Chainer's activated ability is black only, not black in addition to its other colors. It is, however, a Nightmare in addition to its other creature types. As it enters the battlefield, it is already a black Nightmare (and perhaps some other creature types); it doesn't enter and then become a black Nightmare.</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<p class="rtecenter"><img src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/dmr/en_7f237f40e1.png" /></p>

{2}{U}<br />
Instant<br />
Counter target spell unless its controller pays {1} for each card in your graveyard.<br />
Madness {U} <em>(If you discard this card, discard it into exile. When you do, cast it for its madness cost or put it into your graveyard.)</em></p>

<ul>
	<li>Count the number of cards in your graveyard as Circular Logic resolves to determine how much the controller of the target spell has to pay. Circular Logic is still on the stack at that time. It doesn't count itself.</li>
</ul>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;">Cleric of the Forward Order<br />
{1}{W}<br />
Creature — Human Cleric<br />
2/2<br />
When Cleric of the Forward Order enters the battlefield, you gain 2 life for each creature you control named Cleric of the Forward Order.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Count the number of creatures named Cleric of the Forward Order you control as the ability resolves to determine how much life you gain. If the Cleric of the Forward Order with the ability that triggered is still on the battlefield, it will count itself.</li>
</ul>

1/1<br />
Flying<br />
When Cloud of Faeries enters the battlefield, untap up to two lands.<br />
Cycling {2} <em>({2}, Discard this card: Draw a card.)</em></p>

<ul>
	<li>You choose which lands to untap as the triggered ability resolves. They aren't targeted, and they don't have to be lands that you control.</li>

{3}{R}<br />
Creature — Elemental<br />
3/3<br />
When Coal Stoker enters the battlefield, if you cast it from your hand, add {R}{R}{R}.</p>

<ul>
	<li>If a nontoken creature enters the battlefield as a copy of this creature, the copy's enters-the-battlefield ability will still trigger as long as you cast the spell that became that nontoken creature from your hand.</li>
	<li>If a token is created that's a copy of Coal Stoker, the token wasn't cast, and Coal Stoker's ability won't trigger. Similarly, if an effect copies Coal Stoker while it's on the stack, the copy becomes a token, but the copy was created on the stack and not cast from your hand, so the ability won't trigger in that case either.</li>
	<li>Coal Stoker's ability isn't a mana ability. It uses the stack and can be responded to.</li>
</ul>

{G}<br />
Instant<br />
As an additional cost to cast this spell, sacrifice a land.<br />
Search your library for a land card, put that card onto the battlefield, then shuffle.</p>

<ul>
	<li>You can't cast Crop Rotation without sacrificing a land, and you can't sacrifice additional lands.</li>

{5}<br />
Artifact<br />
Tap two untapped creatures you control: You may put a creature card from your hand that shares a creature type with each creature tapped this way onto the battlefield.</p>

<ul>
	<li>The two creatures you tap to activate the ability don't necessarily have to share a creature type, but the creature card you put onto the battlefield must share a creature type with each of them. For example, you could tap an Elf Wizard and a Human Warrior to put an Elf Warrior card onto the battlefield.</li>
	<li>You can tap any untapped creatures you control to activate Cryptic Gateway's ability, even ones you haven't controlled continuously since the beginning of your most recent turn.</li>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;">Damping Sphere<br />
{2}<br />
Artifact<br />
If a land is tapped for two or more mana, it produces {C} instead of any other type and amount.<br />
Each spell a player casts costs {1} more to cast for each other spell that player has cast this turn.</p>

<ul>
	<li>If multiple replacement effects would modify the mana an ability you control produces, choose one to apply. After that, determine if any others are applicable. A replacement effect can't apply to the same event more than once.</li>
	<li>Damping Sphere's second ability counts spells that were cast during a turn even if Damping Sphere wasn't on the battlefield as they were cast. For example, if Damping Sphere itself is the third spell you cast in a turn, the next spell you cast costs {3} more to cast.</li>
	<li>To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost (such as a flashback cost) you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions. The mana value of the spell is determined only by its mana cost, no matter what the total cost to cast the spell was.</li>

Legendary Snow Land<br />
Dark Depths enters the battlefield with ten ice counters on it.<br />
{3}: Remove an ice counter from Dark Depths.<br />
When Dark Depths has no ice counters on it, sacrifice it. If you do, create Marit Lage, a legendary 20/20 black Avatar creature token with flying and indestructible.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Dark Depths doesn't have a mana ability. It doesn't tap for colorless mana.</li>
	<li>The last ability of Dark Depths is a state trigger. It won't trigger again while the ability is on the stack, but if the ability is countered and Dark Depths is still on the battlefield with no ice counters on it, it will trigger again immediately.</li>
	<li>If Dark Depths leaves the battlefield before its triggered ability resolves, you won't be able to sacrifice it, so you won't create Marit Lage.</li>

	<li>If you control other triggered abilities that allow you to draw cards during your draw step, you can choose to order Sylvan Library's ability before or after those abilities. Triggered abilities controlled by other players will resolve before triggered abilities you control.</li>
	<li>Any cards drawn prior to Sylvan Library's ability resolving, including in your upkeep or in response to Sylvan Library's triggered ability, can be chosen to be put back using this effect. Sylvan Library's controller is responsible for keeping these cards distinguishable in hand, such as by keeping them separate from cards that began the turn in hand.</li>
	<li>If you control more than one Sylvan Library, the triggered ability of each will resolve in sequence. You don't get to draw all the cards at once and then put them all back at once.</li>
	<li>You can put back zero, one, or two cards.</li>
	<li>If you choose to draw two cards, then replace one or more of those draws with some other effect, the rest of Sylvan Library's ability still happens. If you've actually drawn only one card that turn, you must choose that card and either pay 4 life or put it on top of your library. If you haven't actually drawn any cards that turn, the rest of the ability has no effect.</li>

For example, say a Triskelion with two +1/+1 counters on it has been dealt 2 damage earlier in the turn. If you activate its ability by removing a +1/+1 counter from it, it now has 2 toughness and is destroyed as a state-based action.

	<li>If Worldgorger Dragon leaves the battlefield before its enters-the-battlefield ability resolves, the "leaves-the-battlefield" ability will trigger and resolve first. It won't return anything. Then the enters-the-battlefield ability will exile all other permanents you control indefinitely.</li>
	<li>If an Aura is exiled with Worldgorger Dragon and then returns to the battlefield, the player who controls the Aura as it enters the battlefield chooses what it will enchant. An Aura put onto the battlefield this way doesn't target anything (so it could be attached to an opponent's permanent with hexproof, for example), but the Aura's enchant ability restricts what it can be attached to. If the Aura can't legally be attached to anything, it stays exiled. It can't enter the battlefield enchanting a permanent that enters the battlefield at the same time.</li>

<p>The Release Notes include information concerning the release of a new <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> set, as well as a
    collection of clarifications and rulings involving that set's cards. They are intended to make playing with the new
    cards more fun by clearing up the common misconceptions and confusion inevitably caused by new mechanics and
    interactions. As future sets are released, updates to the <em>Magic</em> rules may cause some of this information to
    become outdated. Go to <a href="http://magic.wizards.com/rules" target="_blank">Magic.Wizards.com/Rules</a> to find
    the most up-to-date rules.</p>

<p>The "General Notes" section includes information about card legality and explains some of the mechanics and concepts
    in the set.</p>

<p>The "Card-Specific Notes" sections contain answers to the most important, most common, and most confusing questions
    players might ask about cards in the set. Items in the "Card-Specific Notes" sections include full card text for
    your reference. Not all cards in the set are listed.</p>

<h3>New Keyword Ability: Toxic<br />
    Returning Mechanic: Poison Counters</h3>

<p>Poison counters are back! Poison counters are placed on players, not creatures, and a player with ten or more poison
    counters loses the game.</p>

<p>Toxic is a new keyword ability which puts poison counters on a player when a creature with toxic deals combat damage
    to that player. Toxic is always followed by a number, called the <em>toxic value</em>. The toxic value tells you how
    many counters are given to that player. Unlike infect, which caused a creature to deal damage to players in the form
    of poison counters, toxic causes an additional effect—creatures deal their combat damage <em>and</em> the player
    dealt that combat damage gets poisoned.</p>

<div style="margin: 15px auto 25px auto; max-width: 80%">
    <div style="text-align: center;">
        <img style="width: 265px;" alt="Vishgraz, the Doomhive"

        3/3<br />
        Menace, toxic 1 (Players dealt combat damage by this creature also get a poison counter.)<br />
        When Vishgraz, the Doomhive enters the battlefield, create three 1/1 colorless Phyrexian Mite artifact creature
        tokens with toxic 1 and "This creature can't block."<br />
        Vishgraz gets +1/+1 for each poison counter your opponents have.
    </div>
</div>

<div style="margin: 15px auto 25px auto; max-width: 80%">
    <div style="text-align: center;">
        <img style="width: 265px;" alt="Aspirant's Ascent" src="https://media.wizards.com/2023/one/en_7f66cd9a29.png" />
    </div>
    <div style="font-family:courier;"><strong>Aspirant's Ascent</strong><br />
        {U}<br />
        Instant<br />
        Until end of turn, target creature gets +1/+3 and gains flying and toxic 1. <em>(Players dealt combat damage by
            that creature also get a poison counter.)</em>
    </div>
</div>

<h4>General toxic notes:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>A player with ten or more poison counters loses the game. This is a state-based action and doesn't use the
        stack. In other words, it happens immediately and players can't respond to it, just like a player losing the
        game due to having 0 or less life.</li>
    <li>Toxic doesn't change the amount of combat damage a creature deals. For example, if a 2/2 creature with toxic 1
        deals combat damage to a player, that creature will deal 2 damage. The results of that damage are the player
        loses 2 life and gets a poison counter.</li>
    <li>Any other effects of that damage, such as life gain from lifelink, still apply.</li>
    <li>If a creature with toxic deals combat damage to a creature or planeswalker, or if it deals noncombat damage,
        toxic has no effect and no player gets poison counters.</li>
    <li>Damage dealt by a creature with toxic grants the same number of counters regardless of how much damage is dealt.
        Notably, if a replacement effect modifies the damage in some way (such as that of Gratuitous Violence), the
        number of counters given remains unchanged.</li>
    <li>Conversely, replacement effects that apply to the number of counters put on a player can modify the counters
        placed this way. For example, Vorinclex, Monstrous Raider's last two abilities can apply to counters placed this
        way.</li>
    <li>Multiple instances of toxic are cumulative. For example, if a creature has toxic 2 and gains toxic 1 due to
        another effect, combat damage that creature deals to a player will cause that player to get 3 poison counters.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>New Keyword Ability: For Mirrodin!</h3>
<p>This new keyword ability, found on some Equipment cards, represents the struggle of the Mirrans against the forces of Phyrexia. Equipment cards with this ability enter the battlefield with a creature to wield them.</p>

</div>
<div style="font-family:courier;"><strong>Barbed Batterfist</strong><br />
{1}{R}<br /> Artifact — Equipment<br />
For Mirrodin! <em>(When this Equipment enters the battlefield, create a 2/2 red Rebel creature token, then attach this to it.)</em><br />
Equipped creature gets +1/-1.<br />
Equip {1} <em>({1}: Attach to target creature you control. Equip only as a sorcery.)</em>
</div>
</div>

    <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img style="width: 265px;" alt="Dragonwing Glider" src="https://media.wizards.com/2023/one/en_9899932c01.png" />

    {3}{R}{R}<br /> Artifact &mdash; Equipment<br /> For Mirrodin! <em>(When this Equipment enters the battlefield, create a 2/2 red Rebel creature token, then attach this to it.)</em><br /> Equipped creature gets +2/+2 and has flying and haste.<br /> Equip {3}{R}{R}
    </div>
    </div>
    <p>General For Mirrodin! notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Rebel enters the battlefield as a 2/2 creature, then the Equipment becomes attached to it. Abilities that trigger when a creature enters the battlefield see that a 2/2 creature entered the battlefield.</li>
<li>If the Rebel is destroyed, the Equipment stays on the battlefield. Similarly, you may pay its equip cost to move it from the Rebel token to another creature you control.</li>
<li>If the ability causes two Rebel tokens to be created (due to an effect such as that of Mondrak, Glory Dominus), the Equipment becomes attached to only one of them.</li>
</ul>

<h3>New Ability Word: Corrupted</h3>
<p>Corrupted is an ability word which indicates abilities that care whether an opponent has three or more poison counters.</p>

<!-- Apostle of Invasion -->
<div style="margin: 15px auto 25px auto; max-width: 80%">
    <div style="text-align: center;">

    <div style="font-family:courier;"><strong>Apostle of Invasion</strong><br />
    {4}{W}{W}<br /> Creature &mdash; Phyrexian Angel<br /> 4/4<br /> Flying<br /> <em>Corrupted</em> &mdash; As long as an opponent has three or more poison counters, Apostle of Invasion has double strike.
    </div>
    </div>
<!-- Distorted Curiosity -->  
    <div style="margin: 15px auto 25px auto; max-width: 80%">
    <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img style="width: 265px;" alt="Distorted Curiosity" src="https://media.wizards.com/2023/one/en_6f6b186c25.png" />
    </div>
    <div style="font-family:courier;"><strong>Distorted Curiosity</strong><br />
    {2}{U}<br /> Sorcery<br /> <em>Corrupted</em> &mdash; This spell costs {2} less to cast if an opponent has three or more poison counters.<br /> Draw two cards.
    </div>
    </div>
    <ul>
<li>In multiplayer games, only one opponent is required to have three or more poison counters for corrupted abilities to take notice, not all of them.</li>
<li>Some corrupted abilities are activated abilities that can be activated only if an opponent has three or more poison counters. Once such an ability has been activated, it doesn't matter if that condition is still true as the ability tries to resolve.</li>
<li>Some corrupted abilities of instants and sorceries provide effects that happen in addition to the base effect of the spell if an opponent has three or more poison counters. Other corrupted abilities, indicated by the word "instead" provide alternative effects that happen instead of the base effect.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3>New Mechanic: Oil Counters</h3>
<p>Many cards in this set either enter the battlefield with oil counters or put oil counters on other permanents. While they are a slick way for spells and abilities to interact with the permanents that have them, oil counters themselves don't have any special rules significance.</p>

<!-- Gitaxian Raptor -->
<div style="margin: 15px auto 25px auto; max-width: 80%">
    <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img style="width: 265px;" alt="Gitaxian Raptor" src="https://media.wizards.com/2023/one/en_c9a1e1203f.png" />
    </div>
    <div style="font-family:courier;"><strong>Gitaxian Raptor</strong><br />
    {2}{U}<br /> Creature &mdash; Phyrexian Bird<br /> 1/4<br /> Flying<br /> Gitaxian Raptor enters the battlefield with three oil counters on it.<br /> Remove an oil counter from Gitaxian Raptor: Gitaxian Raptor gets +1/-1 until end of turn.
    </div>
    </div>

   <hr />

<h3>Returning Mechanic: Proliferate</h3>
<p>Proliferate is a returning mechanic that can increase the number of counters on permanents and players.</p>

<!-- Cacophony Scamp -->
<div style="margin: 15px auto 25px auto; max-width: 80%">
    <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img style="width: 265px;" alt="Cacophony Scamp" src="https://media.wizards.com/2023/one/en_2d0b632903.png" />
    </div>
    <div style="font-family:courier;"><strong>Cacophony Scamp</strong><br />
    {R}<br /> Creature &mdash; Phyrexian Goblin Warrior<br /> 1/1<br /> Whenever Cacophony Scamp deals combat damage to a player, you may sacrifice it. If you do, proliferate. <em>(Choose any number of permanents and/or players, then give each another counter of each kind already there.)</em><br /> When Cacophony Scamp dies, it deals damage equal to its power to any target.
    </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Ezuri, Stalker of Spheres -->
<div style="margin: 15px auto 25px auto; max-width: 80%">
    <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img style="width: 265px;" alt="Ezuri, Stalker of Spheres" src="https://media.wizards.com/2023/one/en_e83451119f.png" />
    </div>
    <div style="font-family:courier;"><strong>Ezuri, Stalker of Spheres</strong><br />
   {2}{G}{U}<br /> Legendary Creature &mdash; Phyrexian Elf Warrior<br /> 3/3<br /> When Ezuri, Stalker of Spheres enters the battlefield, you may pay {3}. If you do, proliferate twice.<br /> Whenever you proliferate, draw a card.
    </div>
    </div>
<p>General Proliferate Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>To proliferate, you can choose any permanent that has a counter, including ones controlled by opponents. You can choose any player who has a counter, including opponents. You can't choose cards in any zone other than the battlefield, even if they have counters on them.</li>
<li>You don't have to choose every permanent or player that has a counter, only the ones you want to add another counter to. Since "any number" includes zero, you don't have to choose any permanents at all, and you don't have to choose any players at all.</li>
<li>If a player or permanent has more than one kind of counter on it, and you choose for it to get additional counters, it must get one of each kind of counter it already has. You can't have it get just one kind of counter it already has and not the others.</li>
<li>An ability that triggers "Whenever you proliferate" triggers even if you chose no permanents or players while doing so.</li>
<li>Players can respond to a spell or ability whose effect includes proliferating. Once that spell or ability starts to resolve, however, and its controller chooses which permanents and players will get new counters, it's too late for anyone to respond.</li>
<li>If a permanent ever has both +1/+1 counters and -1/-1 counters on it at the same time, they're removed in pairs as a state-based action so that the permanent has only one of those kinds of counters on it.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Card-Specific Notes:</h2>
<!-- All Will Be One -->
<div style="margin: 15px auto 25px auto; max-width: 80%">

    <div style="font-family:courier;"><strong>All Will Be One</strong><br />
   {3}{R}{R}<br /> Enchantment<br /> Whenever you put one or more counters on a permanent or player, All Will Be One deals that much damage to target opponent, creature an opponent controls, or planeswalker an opponent controls.
    </div>
    </div> 
    <ul>
<li>All Will Be One's ability will trigger any time you put one or more counters on a permanent or player. This might be due to a spell or ability resolving, a permanent you control entering the battlefield with counters, or combat damage from a source with toxic, infect, or wither.</li>
<li>If more than one creature with toxic deals combat damage to a player at the same time, those counters are placed as a single event, and the ability triggers one time.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<!-- Ambulatory Edifice -->

    {2}{B}<br /> Artifact Creature &mdash; Phyrexian Construct<br /> 3/2<br /> When Ambulatory Edifice enters the battlefield, you may pay 2 life. When you do, target creature gets -1/-1 until end of turn.
    </div>
    </div>
    <ul>
<li>You don't choose a target for Ambulatory Edifice's last ability at the time it triggers. Rather, a second "reflexive" ability triggers when you pay 2 life this way. You choose a target for that ability as it goes on the stack. Each player may respond to this triggered ability as normal.</li>

    </div>
    </div>
    <ul>
<li>You may choose to target a creature that has mana value greater than 3 even if no player has three of more poison counters.</li>
<li>As Anoint with Affliction resolves, if the creature's controller has three or more poison counters, the creature will be exiled no matter what its mana value is. If the controller doesn't, the creature will be exiled only if its mana value is 3 or less.</li>
</ul>

    {4}{W}{W}<br /> Creature &mdash; Phyrexian Angel<br /> 4/4<br /> Flying<br /> <em>Corrupted</em> &mdash; As long as an opponent has three or more poison counters, Apostle of Invasion has double strike.
    </div>
    </div>
    <ul>
<li>In a multiplayer game, Apostle of Invasion can lose double strike after dealing damage in the first combat damage step if all the opponents that had three or more poison counters left the game. (This is most likely due to that combat damage, so good job!). In that case, it will not deal any combat damage in the regular combat damage step.</li>

<li>Non-copy effects that have already applied to the equipped creature will continue to apply to it. For example, +1/+1 counters on it will still affect it.</li>
<li>The copiable values granted by Blade of Shared Souls are locked in as its effect begins to apply. After that point, it doesn't matter if the creature that's being copied leaves the battlefield or if any of its copiable values change.</li>
<li>If the target creature isn't normally a creature (for example, an animated Monument to Perfection), the equipped creature will become a copy of the noncreature permanent.

<li>If the target creature is copying something else (for example, if that creature is equipped by another Blade of Shared Souls), then the equipped creature becomes a copy of whatever the target creature copied.</li>
<li>If the target creature is a token, the equipped creature copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that created it.

    </div>
</div>
<ul>
<li>Drivnod affects a creature's own "when this creature dies" triggered abilities as well as other triggered abilities that trigger when that creature dies. Such triggered abilities start with "when" or "whenever."</li>
<li>Drivnod's effect doesn't copy the triggered ability; it just causes the ability to trigger twice. Any choices made as you put the ability onto the stack, such as modes and targets, are made separately for each instance of the ability. Any choices made on resolution, such as whether to pay a cost for that triggered ability, are also made separately.</li>
<li>The trigger event doesn't have to specifically refer to "creatures." In these cases, the trigger event may also refer to something being "put into a graveyard from the battlefield." For example, an ability that triggers "whenever an artifact is put into a graveyard from the battlefield" would trigger twice if an artifact creature dies while Drivnod, Carnage Dominus is on the battlefield.</li>
<li>An ability that triggers when a creature "leaves the battlefield" will trigger twice if that creature leaves the battlefield by dying.</li>
<li>An ability that triggers on an event that causes a creature to die doesn't trigger twice. For example, an ability that triggers "whenever you sacrifice a creature" triggers only once.</li>
<li>Look at each creature as it exists on the battlefield, taking into account continuous effects, to determine whether any triggered abilities will trigger multiple times. For example, if a land that has become a creature dies, an ability that triggers when it dies triggers twice.</li>
<li>If a creature dying at the same time that another permanent you control leaves the battlefield causes a triggered ability of that permanent to trigger, that ability triggers an additional time.</li>
<li>If a creature dying at the same time as Drivnod (including Drivnod itself dying) causes a triggered ability of a permanent you control to trigger, that ability triggers an additional time.</li>
<li>If you somehow control two Drivnods, a creature dying causes abilities to trigger three times, not four. A third Drivnod causes abilities to trigger four times, a fourth causes abilities to trigger five times, and so on. This also means that if you control Drivnod and cast a second one, an ability that triggers when it dies due to the "legend rule" triggers three times.</li>
<li>A nontoken creature dying will cause an ability of a permanent that triggers whenever a card is put into a graveyard "from anywhere" to trigger twice only if Drivnod and that permanent are both still on the battlefield immediately after the creature has died.</li></ul>

    {4}{W}<br /> Legendary Creature &mdash; Phyrexian Praetor<br /> 4/7<br /> Vigilance<br /> If a permanent entering the battlefield causes a triggered ability of a permanent you control to trigger, that ability triggers an additional time.<br /> Permanents entering the battlefield don't cause abilities of permanents your opponents control to trigger.
    </div>
</div>
<ul>
<li>Elesh Norn's second and third ability each affects a permanent's own enters-the-battlefield triggered abilities as well as other triggered abilities that trigger when that permanent enters the battlefield. Such triggered abilities start with "when" or "whenever." Some keyword abilities also include a triggered ability that happens when a permanent enters the battlefield, such as For Mirrodin!</li>
<li>Replacement effects are unaffected by Elesh Norn's abilities. For example, a creature that enters the battlefield under your control with one +1/+1 counter on it won't receive an additional +1/+1 counter.</li>
<li>Abilities that apply "as [this permanent] enters the battlefield," such as choosing a card type with Stenn, Paranoid Partisan, are also unaffected.</li>
<li>Elesh Norn's abilities don't look at who controls the permanent entering the battlefield, only who controls the permanent that has the triggered ability. For example, if you control Elesh Norn and a permanent with the ability "Whenever a creature enters the battlefield, you gain 1 life," a creature entering the battlefield under an opponent's control will cause that ability to trigger twice.</li>
<li>Elesh Norn's first ability doesn't copy the triggered ability; it just causes the ability to trigger twice. Any choices made as you put the ability onto the stack, such as modes and targets, are made separately for each instance of the ability. Any choices made on resolution, such as whether to put counters on a permanent, are also made individually.</li>
<li>If you somehow control two Elesh Norns, a permanent entering the battlefield causes abilities to trigger three times, not four. A third Elesh Norn causes abilities to trigger four times, a fourth causes abilities to trigger five times, and so on.</li>
<li>If a permanent entering the battlefield at the same time as Elesh Norn (including Elesh Norn itself) causes a triggered ability of a permanent you control to trigger, that ability triggers an additional time.</li>
<li>Similarly, a permanent entering the battlefield at the same time as Elesh Norn (still including Elesh Norn) won't cause abilities of permanents an opponent controls to trigger.</li>
<li>If a triggered ability is linked to a second ability, additional instances of that triggered ability are also linked to that second ability. If the second ability refers to "the exiled card," it refers to all cards exiled by instances of the triggered ability.</li>
<li>In some cases involving linked abilities, an ability requires information about "the exiled card." When this happens, the ability gets multiple answers. If these answers are being used to determine the value of a variable, the sum is used. For example, if Elite Arcanist's enters-the-battlefield ability triggers twice, two cards are exiled. The value of X in the activation cost of Elite Arcanist's other ability is the sum of the two cards' mana values. As the ability resolves, you create copies of both cards and can cast none, one, or both of the copies in any order.</li>
<li>In a Two-Headed Giant game, Elesh Norn does not affect triggered abilities of permanents your teammate controls.</li>

    </div>
</div>
<ul>
<li>When comparing the stats of the two creatures for Evolving Adaptive's last ability, you always compare power to power and toughness to toughness.</li>
<li>Whenever another creature enters the battlefield under your control, check its power and toughness against the power and toughness of Evolving Adaptive. If neither stat of the new creature is greater, the last ability won't trigger at all.</li>
<li>If the ability triggers, the stat comparison will happen again when the ability tries to resolve. If neither stat of the new creature is greater, the ability will do nothing. If the creature that entered the battlefield leaves the battlefield before the ability tries to resolve, use its last known power and toughness to compare the stats.</li>
<li>If a creature enters the battlefield with +1/+1 counters on it, consider those counters when determining if Evolving Adaptive's ability will trigger.</li>
<li>When comparing the stats as the ability resolves, it's possible that the stat that's greater changes from power to toughness or vice versa. If this happens, the ability will still resolve and you'll put an oil counter on Evolving Adaptive. For example, if you control an Evolving Adaptive with two oil counters and a 1/3 creature enters the battlefield under your control, its toughness is greater so the ability will trigger. In response, the 1/3 creature gets +2/-2. When the ability tries to resolve, its power is greater. You'll put an oil counter on Evolving Adaptive.</li>
<li>If multiple creatures enter the battlefield at the same time, Evolving Adaptive's ability may trigger multiple times, although the stat comparison will take place each time one of those abilities tries to resolve. For example, if you control an Evolving Adaptive with two oil counters on it and two 3/3 creatures enter the battlefield, the ability will trigger twice. The first ability will resolve and put an oil counter on Evolving Adaptive. When the second ability tries to resolve, neither the power nor the toughness of the new creature is greater than that of Evolving Adaptive, so that ability does nothing.</li>

<li>If the copied creature has {X} in its mana cost, X is 0.</li>
<li>If the copied creature is a token, the new token that's created copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that created that token, with the exceptions noted above.</li>
<li>If the copied permanent is copying something else, then the token enters the battlefield as whatever that permanent copied, with the exceptions noted above.</li>
<li>Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied permanent will trigger when the token enters the battlefield. Any "as [this permanent] enters the battlefield" or "[this permanent] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the chosen permanent will also work.</li>
<li>Kaya's last ability checks to see whether the permanent was an Aura when it last existed on the battlefield, not whether it is an Aura card in exile. For example, if an enchantment creature with the bestow ability (an ability that allows a creature card to be cast as an Aura instead) is an Aura and the target of Kaya's last ability, the ability will not create a copy of it.</li>

<ul>
<li>A copy is created even if the spell that caused the delayed triggered ability to trigger has been countered by the time that delayed triggered ability resolves. The copy resolves before the original spell.</li>
<li>The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If the spell is a permanent spell with targets, such as an Aura, you may also choose a new target for that spell. The new targets must be legal. If, for any target, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).</li>
<li>The copy is created on the stack, so it's not "cast." Creating the copy won't cause abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell to trigger.</li>
<li>If the spell that's copied is modal (that is, it says "Choose one &mdash;" or the like), the copy will have the same mode or modes. You can't choose different ones.</li>

<li>The "total toxic value" of a creature is usually just the number after the word toxic on that creature. However, if a creature has gained multiple instances of toxic, the total toxic value of that creature is the sum of those numbers. For example, if a creature that has toxic 2 later gains toxic 1 due to an effect, it has both toxic 1 and toxic 2, and its total toxic value is 3.</li>
<li>The creature isn't chosen until the corrupted ability resolves. Notably, this means you may respond to that ability by giving a creature toxic (or more toxic) in order to draw more cards. (Of course, your opponents can also respond to try and stop you, but interaction is fun.)</li>
<li>You may choose any creature you control, including one that doesn't have toxic, if you don't want to draw cards. If you don't control any creatures, you won't draw any cards.</li>

    </div>
</div>
<ul>
<li>Phased out permanents are treated as though they don't exist. They can't be the target of spells or abilities, their static abilities have no effect on the game, their triggered abilities can't trigger, they can't attack or block, and so on.</li>
<li>As a permanent is phased out, Auras and Equipment attached to it also phase out at the same time. Those Auras and Equipment will phase in at the same time that permanent does, and they'll phase in still attached to that permanent.</li>
<li>Permanents phase back in during their controller's untap step, immediately before that player untaps their permanents. Creatures that phase in this way are able to attack and pay a cost of {T} during that turn. If a permanent had counters on it when it phased out, it will have those counters when it phases back in.</li>
<li>An attacking or blocking creature that phases out is removed from combat.</li>
<li>Phasing out doesn't cause permanents to leave or re-enter the battlefield, so no "leaves the battlefield" or "enters the battlefield" abilities will trigger.</li>
<li>Any continuous effects with a "for as long as" duration, such as that of Mind Flayer, ignore phased-out objects. If ignoring those objects causes the effect's conditions to no longer be met, the duration will expire.</li>

<li>To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost (such as a flashback cost) you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions.

<li>A spell cast using flashback will always be exiled afterward, whether it resolves, is countered, or leaves the stack in some other way.</li>
<li>You can cast a spell using flashback even if it was somehow put into your graveyard without having been cast.</li>
<li>If a card with flashback is put into your graveyard during your turn, you can cast it if it's legal to do so before any other player can take any actions.</li>

<h1>A City Alone: The History of New Capenna</h1>

<h2>Capenna Before</h2>

<p>The people of New Capenna act like there was no history before the city; they're wrong. There was a plane out there centuries ago, one of many cities, kings, cultures, and wonders. That Capenna, <em>Old </em>Capenna, is gone, lost in a cataclysmic war against a forgotten enemy—the same war that prompted the creation of New Capenna, the towering city. While there might be pockets of civilization out there in the unknown, as far as the people of New Capenna are concerned, their city <em>is</em> the plane.</p>

<h2>Defiant Against the End</h2>

<p>Safety in New Capenna's heights came at the cost of memory, living and recorded, and saw history transmuted into myth and legend. The invaders ate hope, turned parents against their children, and poisoned the plane for millennia. It was only through the intervention of Old Capenna's archangels and their hosts that the plane's mortal defenders stood a chance. Allied with these divine warriors, Old Capenna's defenders managed to hold a small pocket of land, encircled but defiant against the end.</p>

<p>In these defenders, the roots of the modern five families can be found: the paladins that would go on to become the Brokers, the druids that would become the Cabaretti, the weaponsmiths and artisans that would become the Riveteers, the oracles that would become the Obscura, and the aristocrats that bankrolled them all, the noble classes that would become the Maestros.</p>

<h2>Hope, Shielded by Fire</h2>

<p>The invading enemy sent their forces again and again against the spears of Old Capenna's final defenders, and though the angels and mortals held, it was plain to the archangels that they could not win. The enemy's numbers were inexhaustible; in addition to their own knights, the enemy added the mortal dead to their number, sending the animated corpses of fallen defenders to fight against their comrades. To save the people of Old Capenna from this fate—and the plane from total defeat—the archangels turned to an old, familiar enemy: the archdemons of Old Capenna.</p>

<h2>A Fortress Above</h2>

<p>While the allied armies of Old Capenna held the line, the archangels and archdemons together raised a shining tower, a mighty fortress that pierced the clouds. As quickly as they could, the people of Old Capenna hurried to the safety of the fortress tower, lending their own labor to build it higher, to fill it with streets and parks, boulevards and buildings that looked like home and stood in shining defiance of the enemy that swarmed the plane outside. This place would hold the plane: this fortress became a city, a city the people called New Capenna.</p>

<h2>The Plane Is Dead, Long Live the Plane</h2>

<p>The allied forces of the archangels, mortals, and archdemons were the last to enter the city, after holding open corridors for refugees to stream into the lower elevators. The enemy never stopped. Legends tell of the last battle of the war being fought on the final elevator, with allied soldiers throwing enemy knights off the rising platform as it approached the underbelly of the city. The enemy rebuffed, the last elevator arrived, and New Capenna was sealed to all below.</p>

<h2>A Stark Question</h2>

<p>With the surviving population of the plane safe inside of New Capenna, the archangels and archdemons let the people celebrate. However, the archangels could not find joy, as they knew a dark truth. This tower, for all its might and defiance, would still not be enough to stop the enemy. Though well defended and difficult to access, if the enemy could find a way inside, which they would never stop trying to find, the war would rage here as it did far below. Thus, the city's architects puzzled over a stark question: how could they guarantee the safety of the city and the plane upon which it stood when they were so grossly outnumbered?</p>

</figure>
</div>

<h2>A Bleak Answer</h2>

<p>While the archangels puzzled, the archdemons of Capenna plotted. During the war, Capenna's archangels and their angelic hosts ravaged the enemy with their mere presence. The archdemons studied this divine natural weapon and realized that if they could trap angels and distribute their essence across the whole of New Capenna—maybe even out into Old Capenna—they could drive the enemy back and ensure the city and <em>their</em> people would be saved. Alone, though, they could not accomplish their betrayal, so the archdemons sent their whisperers to the ears of mortal, power-hungry Capennans, planting a bleak answer to the question of the future: trap the angels, and let an age of demons begin.</p>

<h2>Demontown, Part 1</h2>

<p>The archdemons' five mortal champions were minor leaders and influential, petty aristocrats, charismatic in their own ways and already gathering small but passionate followings: Raffine, a controversial fortune-telling sphinx who long believed she was an instrument of prophecy. Lord Xander, an ailing artist of an all-but-dead aristocratic house, jealous over the critical acclaim his younger peers received. Ziatora, a young dragon berserker and bandit leader who lived to fight and dreamed only of power. Jetmir, a prodigal son turned hermit druid, who refused his order's asceticism, indulged in wild hedonistic parties, and never wanted the music to stop. These four were gathered by the final archdemonic champion, a brilliant, uncompromising, utterly fanatical lawyer, Falco Spara.</p>

</div>

<h2>Demontown, Part 2</h2>

<p>Eager to gain a slice of New Capenna before all wedges of power were claimed, these mortals gave themselves over to the archdemons, whose plot against the archangels could only be accomplished through the archdemons' own mutual sacrifice. The five became demonic hybrids, gifted and cursed by the archdemons bound to them, their vices magnified and powers enhanced.</p>

<p>Together with their archdemon patrons, these demon hybrids and their followers took advantage of a sudden slumber that struck the invaders' forces—its cause unknown, but nevertheless welcome—to act on their plan and achieve success beyond their most optimistic projections. In place of a prolonged battle, the archdemons and the five captured the archangels and their hosts during a city-wide celebration of victory. While the people were told the archangels had voluntarily sacrificed themselves to send the enemy into a slumber, the five and their organizations, their families, suppressed the grim truth: that the archdemons had used the angels in the defense of the city, trapping them in a kind of stasis that saw their physical bodies converted, slowly, into the fuel of the new age: Halo.</p>

<h2>The Business of Crime</h2>

<p>In the modern era, the five families have settled in to dominate niche industries and command territory in the city's three boroughs, operating in full view of each other and in secret. A nominal, all-but-vestigial city government ensures the lights stay on, the water is clean, and the streets are kept in good repair. Law as other planes know it—a crown or government and a police force, with hard rules and penalties for those who break them—does not exist in New Capenna. Instead, there is an agreement, a code agreed to by the five families. This code, first drafted by Falco and agreed to by the leaders of the five families, establishes the loose rules of peace: as long as you stay in your lane, you may do what you like.</p>

</figure>
</div>

<h2>Renting Peace</h2>

<p>With no city authority to regulate them, the families must keep themselves in line. Fronts, subterfuge, and clandestine operations are played out as mutually understood theater. They all do it, and they all understand that it is polite to try and hide their flaunting of the rules, a nod to the fact that the rules exist. Flexibility, allowances, favors, and looking the other way is key in New Capenna: as long as no one family attempts to take too much for themselves, neither will the other families, and there is peace in New Capenna. This is a bloody kind of peace, to be sure—enforcers and street-level bosses scrap and fight, goons become bodies, small shipments go missing—but to the families, those are acceptable losses. Rent, paid to prevent war.</p>

</div>

<h2>The Sacrifice</h2>

<p>The vast population of New Capenna had no knowledge of the archdemons' betrayal of the archangels and the five families' power grab. The invasion had raged for generations. They were exhausted, scared, and hungry for safety. If ineffective kings and weak administrators couldn't provide it for them, then maybe these new organizations, these five families with their charismatic leaders, could. The angels sacrificed themselves to gift you this city, the family bosses said. They gave themselves up to make Halo, to distribute it across the city and throughout the air itself, so that you could be safe and prosperous, industrious, working to build this city ever higher and grander, with the hope to one day return to the plane below when the angels' sacrifice is complete. The people accepted this proposition. They thanked the angels for their sacrifice, let the comforting shield of Halo fall over them and erase the past, and then got to work.</p>

<h2>Whatever Happened to the Rest of the Plane?</h2>

<p>In the present day, New Capenna is a bustling hive, a plane-in-a-city that towers miles into the sky atop a forest of structural columns and anchors, surrounded by a skirt of wires and a shield of diffuse Halo, the very essence of the angels.</p>

<p>To the people of New Capenna, the threat that drove their ancestors into the city is so distant as to be all but forgotten. That was the old plane, "out there" and long ago. On occasion, new arrivals with old names ride the ancient lifts up from below, bringing with them stories of hard-lived lives and wasteland nightmares, but they find that few in New Capenna are very interested in what happens outside of the city. In time, these new immigrants, too, find themselves forgetting. The pace of the city demands it. New Capenna is the city of opportunity: a place to forget who you were, a place to write a new future as you seek a new fortune or build a new life on this new plane.</p>

<h2>Last Call</h2>

<p>When we arrive to New Capenna, we discover the facade of peace between the five families is beginning to crumble. Halo, a viscous, divine, oil-like fluid in high demand for its magic-enhancing and curative power, is running out.</p>

<p>The families all sense the end is coming, even if they don't know the shape or method by which it will arrive. Already they've begun stockpiling as much Halo as they can, and there's little enough to go around. Places and people once understood to be off limits have become targets. The violence once restricted to the docks and warehouses of the Caldaia and the alleys of the Mezzio has crept up to splatter the golden streets of Park Heights.</p>

<p>None of the five families know what happens next, but all of them agree on one thing: the balance of power in the city is shifting. The rules they used to live by no longer apply. Halo, the thing that saved the city once, might doom it now. Angels, once thought vanished from the plane, are starting to return. The archdemons who granted the families their power are distant. The party is about to come to a crashing halt, and none of the families want to be left to pick up the tab.</p>

<h1>New Capenna: The City Today</h1>

<p>There is more to the plane than just the city of New Capenna, though you wouldn't know it if you asked any of New Capenna's citizens. The city is a colossal urban tower built atop the rubble of a forgotten kingdom's capital, a lone sentinel in a vast and empty wasteland, containing almost the entirety of the plane's population. The metropolis is split into three distinct boroughs, from bottom to top: the industrial Caldaia, the bustling Mezzio, and the glamorous Park Heights.</p>

</figure>
</div>

<h2>The Caldaia</h2>

<p>The Caldaia is the bottommost borough of New Capenna, the industrial heart of the city full of factories, warehouses, and titanic infrastructure. The structural columns of New Capenna stand mighty here, dwarfed only by the power of the Riveteers who call the Caldaia home. Though the Caldaia might lack the glamor of Park Heights or the cutthroat striving of the Mezzio, it is animated by purpose, grit, and gumption. Without the laborers of the Caldaia, united and organized by the Riveteers, New Capenna would grind to a halt.</p>

<p>The Caldaia is home to a diverse population of humans, devils, viashino, and rhox, living and working together in the row houses and factories there, or riding the city's elevators up to build the chrome towers of the Mezzio and Park Heights.</p>

</figure>
</div>

<h2>Caldaia Locations</h2>

<p>The Caldaia is the busy, crowded, industrial base of New Capenna. The Riveteers are the dominant family here, but they are outnumbered by the sheer mass of working people that live in the Caldaia's densely packed apartments.</p>

<p>The most notorious of these districts in the Caldaia is the Verts, where the city streets have been removed on either side of the block, creating a fortress-like row of apartment buildings where high-ranking Riveteers relax.</p>

</figure>
</div>

<h2>The Mezzio</h2>

<p>The Mezzio is the vibrant, striving, densely populated, and largest borough of New Capenna. The middle layer of the city, the Mezzio never sleeps. Whether its commuter traffic up from the Caldaia or back down from Park Heights, the streets of the Mezzio are always busy, always humming with life, promise, and people. Always building, always remaking itself, never quiet, never boring; in the Mezzio, laborers in stained dungarees rub shoulders on the subway with socialites in furs. Maestro enforcers walk the same streets as Obscura mystics. Between the fire of industry below and the ritzy playground of Park Heights above, the Mezzio is the "real" city of New Capenna, where dreams are cultured and fortunes made—and lost. When you're in the middle, climbing and falling are both only a step away. The Mezzio is home to the Cabaretti, Obscura, and Maestros.</p>

</figure>
</div>

<h2>Mezzio Locations</h2>

<p>The Mezzio is where decadence and austerity collide, mixing into an eclectic, chaotic, vibrant tapestry where tradition dances with progress and creates the city. The Mezzio is hustle and bustle, never asleep; there's always something to do, someone to see, somewhere to go, with interesting food, music, a show, a scene—it's no wonder the Cabaretti and the Maestros fight to call this borough of the city home.</p>

<p>Though the Caldaia claims the industrial heart of the city, the Mezzio claims its cultural heart. From the great station of Bassomar Bridge that connects the Caldaia to the Mezzio, to Vesti Square in the never-dark center of the city, and all the way up to Cloudponte Bridge, the Mezzio is the largest borough of New Capenna.</p>

</figure>
</div>

<h2>Park Heights</h2>

<p>Above it all is Park Heights, the airy uppermost borough of New Capenna where buildings glitter in chrome, gold, glass, and steel, scraping the sky and arcing above the clouds. There is nothing above Park Heights but the celestial arc of stars, and the people who call Park Heights home know it.</p>

<p>The least densely populated borough of the city, Park Heights hosts the homes and headquarters of New Capenna's bosses, owners, and titans of industry. Opera houses, orchestra halls, members-only clubs, venues, shops, parks, estates, and gardens can all be found in Park Heights as well: anything exclusive, anything opulent, anything that citizens of the Caldaia and Mezzio think frivolous—but secretly desire—one can find in this borough of the city. In Park Heights, every sidewalk is a runway, every shop is a stage, and any rule can be broken if you know who to pay.</p>

<p>Park Heights is home to the Brokers.</p>

<h2>Park Heights Locations</h2>

<p>Park Heights is the top of New Capenna, where the mighty play and indulge, and the city itself bends to their will. It is a beautiful place, with rolling green parks, trees, public gardens, and the only borough where one can look up and see nothing but sky. The central feature of Park Heights is the park that gave the borough its name: Ferara Park, where the city fathers commissioned landscape that emulated the elysian acres of Old Capenna, including the kraken they imported and installed in the park's central lake.</p>

<h1>New Capenna: The Five Families</h1>

<h2>The Riveteers</h2>

<p>Hailing from the artisans that built the kingdoms of Old Capenna, the Riveteers are the major power of the Caldaia, the mortal builders of New Capenna, and the keepers of the largest stockpile of Halo in the city. They are a rowdy, action-first, move-fast-and-break-things crime family whose members are not afraid of fighting hammer and nail to accomplish their goals. Once a union of workers, the Riveteers still hold to many of the values that once organized them: loyalty, strength in numbers, and mutual support.</p>

<div class="figure-wrapper">

</figure>
</div>

<p>Managed by the steady claw of the demon-dragon Ziatora, the Riveteers's purview encompasses the whole of the city, even if they typically are only associated with its lower levels. No building goes up—or comes down—without the Riveteers's knowledge and expertise. Without them, the city falls. Spurred on by Ziatora's totalizing draconic vision, the Riveteers believe themselves heirs to a draconic heritage; they can take the city apart and build it anew, and they are unafraid to engage in this aggressive deconstruction and remaking, especially if the target of their efforts are their enemies.</p>

<div class="figure-wrapper">

</figure>
</div>

<p>The Riveteers are concentrated in the Caldaia, where they work in the factories and forges but can also be encountered throughout the city erecting buildings and tearing down those who fail to keep up with their protection payments.</p>

<h2>The Riveteers Central Locations</h2>

<p>The Riveteers's headquarters is The Treza, a cavernous warehouse lair in the port district of the Caldaia, where Ziatora lounges and manages the Riveteers's business. Inside this massive space, Ziatora has had her Riveteers build a monument to her own glory, shaping its iron beams and balconies into draconic shapes. High ceilings and channels of molten metals define the interior of the space, crossing over floors of dark glass. The Treza is always busy, echoing with the sound of Riveteers smugglers fencing their latest hauls, lair bosses training their new recruits, and general carousing.</p>

<p>Hidden below The Treza and open only to Ziatora and her most senior Riveteers officers is Ziatora's Dracotreasury, a massive vault full of gold and Halo. This place is dangerous to those without draconic heritage or other protection: the air itself burns with toxic gasses piped in from the Caldaia's industrial plants, a security measure to protect the Kingdom-Era treasures, gold, and Halo Ziatora stores within.</p>

<h2>The Obscura</h2>

<p>In Old Capenna, the Obscura were wizards; now, they deal in prophecy, fortune telling, and esoteric communion with dreams and the realm of the dead. If an event happens in the city, the Obscura will have predicted it, captured it with their signature aperture magic, and filed it away in their archives. They are the builders and breakers of fortune; for a price, you can have the future that you want, or bury someone else's.</p>

<div class="figure-wrapper">
<figure><img alt="Obscura Ascendancy" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/c4rd4r7_UuzzGxLR9r.jpg" />

</figure>
</div>

<p>The Obscura are led by Raffine, a sphinx-demon from Old Capenna prone to portentous visions of the future. The Obscura work to keep balance between the five families; if they can't conquer the city by sheer muscle, they can at least command the flow of information in New Capenna by running cons, blackmailing powerful adversaries, rumormongering, grifting, and laundering reputations.</p>

<div class="figure-wrapper">

</figure>
</div>

<p>The Obscura are concentrated in the Mezzio, though they are also found among the rarified parlors of Park Heights and scummy sewers of the Caldaia. As diviners—and directors—of prophecy, fate, and fortune, it is the Obscura's job to be everywhere in the city, and to appear as if they are nowhere but the warm confines of their shops and parlors.</p>

<p>Their headquarters is the Cloud Spire, a seemingly inaccessible skyscraper in Park Heights, where Raffine and their high officers keep tabs on the city through an extensive network of surveillance magics.</p>

</div>

<h2>The Obscura Central Locations</h2>

<p>Though the Obscura center most of their actions in the Mezzio, the palace of the mind and soul at the heart of the Obscura's operations is the Cloud Spire, a towering skyscraper in Park Heights. There, in its uppermost observation decks, Raffine keeps her office amidst the Obscura's most sensitive, powerful instruments of augury and surveillance: the air itself is full of whispers and ghostly images, a real-time feed of the city fed to Raffine by her field agents.</p>

<p>Lower levels of the Cloud Spire contain the Interfactorium, where Obscura agents plot and scheme using scale maps of the entire city and a temporal-prophetic library of histories and potential futures.</p>

<h2>The Maestros</h2>

<p>Once the aristocracy of Old Capenna, the Maestros of New Capenna are master assassins with a code: be precise, be professional, and be thorough. They think of themselves as artists and critics. Paintings, sculptures, or performances, the Maestros are avid collectors always in search of the next big thing while, at the same time, quietly working to curate New Capenna's past, keeping the secrets of Old Capenna hidden in their museum archives and vaults.</p>

<div class="figure-wrapper">
<figure><img alt="Maestros Ascendancy" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/c4rd4r7_1ZPbrBJx6O.jpg" />

</figure>
</div>

<p>Led by the demon-vampire Lord Xander, the Maestros are New Capenna's premier assassins, vampiric professional killers who see a contract not just as business but as a chance to perform. They maintain a warped and self-serving view of their work: they are saviors of the city, philanthropists beyond compare, and are ruthless in their pursuit of the fame and cultural cache that they believe they deserve. They will kill without a thought or moment of regret if it means achieving their goals.</p>

<div class="figure-wrapper">
<figure><img alt="Lord Xander, the Collector" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/c4rd4r7_qjOyVnSfYZ.jpg" />

</figure>
</div>

<p>The Maestros are thick amongst the Mezzio and Park Heights. Rarely found in the Caldaia unless engaged in philanthropic pursuits, Maestros enforcers and assassins prefer what they think are the finer, more cultured districts of New Capenna. Equally at home in an exclusive lounge as they are at a high-class gala, members of the Maestros have an undeniable allure about them—a gift of vampirism, to be sure, but also of taste. Their headquarters is the Museum of Old Capenna, in Park Heights, where Lord Xander keeps his office.</p>

<div class="figure-wrapper">

</div>

<h2>The Maestros Central Locations</h2>

<p>Like the Obscura, the Maestros haunt the Mezzio but keep their headquarters in Park Heights. The Museum of Old Capenna is the main Maestros hangout where Lord Xander holds court as chief curator and host. At the museum, one can wander through the warm, clean halls of New Capenna's history, viewing art, sculptures, and artifacts from the Kingdom Era, the city's early history, and even some contemporary pieces. Hidden throughout the museum are entrances to both the Shadow Hostel, where assassins gather to trade secrets and contracts, and Xander's Vault, the old vampire's personal collection of artifacts, weapons, mementos, and art.</p>

<h2>The Cabaretti</h2>

<p>Raised from the druids and bards of Old Capenna, the Cabaretti are the engine that fuels New Capenna's celebrations, festivals, and parties, dictating both pop culture and the trends that move the city's elite. Opulent revelers, the Cabaretti run dance halls, concert venues, and the finest restaurants up and down the city's boroughs. Their doors are always open, and they'll always greet you with a smile, but don't ever try to leave without paying your tab.</p>

<div class="figure-wrapper">
<figure><img alt="Cabaretti Ascendancy" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/c4rd4r7_CidX5txHAm.jpg" />

</figure>
</div>

<p>The Cabaretti are managed by the demon-cat Jetmir, known for both his generosity and jealousy in equal measure. Once a druid of middling reputation, Jetmir's long life at the helm of the Cabaretti has cemented his reputation as the <em>true</em> master of ceremonies. In New Capenna, the Cabaretti deal in favors, culture, and coin. Their parties and influencers dictate who is "in" and who is "out," which restaurants and venues succeed and which fail, whose music is played at bandstands and whose records wind up in a Caldaia dumpster. If you want to make it in New Capenna as a star or tycoon, you'll have to find a way to pay your dues to the Cabaretti first.</p>

</figure>
</div>

<p>The Cabaretti are found throughout the Mezzio and Park Heights where they are tastemakers and breakers, culture-seekers, and creators. Their headquarters is the Vantoleone, a sprawling venue in the Mezzio where New Capenna's major celebrations are held, and father Jetmir ensures the Halo never stops flowing.</p>

</figure>
</div>

<h2>Cabaretti Central Location</h2>

<p>The Cabaretti are creatures of the Mezzio, running nightclubs, music halls, and lounges throughout the city's largest borough. Their most famous venue is the Vantoleone, a sprawling leisure and entertainment complex where the party is quite literally never ending, Halo is flowing, and any pleasure or preference one seeks can be found for a price, as always.</p>

<p>Though the Vantoleone is open to the public, areas of this massive complex are off limits to all but the most exclusive guests: the Rose Room of the Vantoleone is the most exclusive, a lounge whose doors only open for high-ranking Cabaretti officers, the trendiest stars, and those whom Jetmir personally finds curious, interesting, or alluring.</p>

<h2>The Brokers</h2>

<p>The Brokers were first recruited from the paladins of Old Capenna; in New Capenna, they are rigorous favor-dealers that practice a self-serving, but still useful, form of contract protection. They focus on keeping a peace that benefits the five families and maintains the facade that this is a city with rules and order. They will keep you safe whether you want them to or not.</p>

<div class="figure-wrapper">
<figure><img alt="Brokers Ascendancy" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/c4rd4r7_U7ODzw61jb.jpg" />

</figure>
</div>

<p>The Brokers are led by the demon-aven Falco Spara, the originator of the Brokers's contract-weaving abilities. As New Capenna has grown and become more removed from its founding era, Falco, the once gregarious public defender, has withdrawn into his residence in Park Heights where he leads the Brokers from behind a desk and occupies himself with esoteric legal theory.</p>

<p>Whispers surround his practice: that he works to interpret a doomsday prophecy that threatens all of New Capenna, and rather than prevent it, he guides the Brokers to take advantage of this coming doom. These whispers are quickly silenced by senior partners, who privately worry that Falco's prophetic obsession might see his worst fears realized.</p>

<div class="figure-wrapper">
<figure><img alt="Falco Spara, Pactweaver" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/c4rd4r7_aapnFI9ZVP.jpg" />

</figure>
</div>

<p>The Brokers are servants first, agents of the upper crust's upper crust, and bruisers comfortable on the underside of the barrel—the armor on their suits is there for a reason.</p>

<p>Practicing a unique style of contract magic invented by their founder, the Brokers offer their services at no upfront cost to those in desperate need. Whether accosted by a gang of brass-knuckle-toting Riveteers in the Caldaia or cornered by bloodthirsty Maestros assassins in Park Heights, the Brokers will intercede when called, offer terms, and fight on their new clients' behalf. The price is always the same: a favor, to be collected later, for a benefit—your teeth, your business, or your life—that's hard to turn down.</p>

<p>The Brokers's headquarters is Nido Sanctuary, a lavish office in the central district of the Mezzio.</p>

<div class="figure-wrapper">

</figure>
</div>

<h2>The Brokers Central Location</h2>

<p>Though the Brokers's officers tend to live in Park Heights around Falco's penthouse, their main offices are in the Mezzio. Nido Sanctuary is a bright, clean, and well-appointed office complex in the heart of the borough, with readily accessible law offices and defense firms open to the public at all hours.</p>

<p>The Sanctuary's off-limits areas house training areas, armories, and dormitories for solicitors and new recruits. Falco Spara has quarters in Nido as well, though he rarely uses them anymore and frequents the firm as the text of his prophecy is kept in its ironclad vault.</p>

Aspirants circulated among the vertebral towers like blood coursing through arteries, each step an invitation for the apothegms of the Argent Etchings—Elesh Norn's word made metal and flesh—to seize them with spasms of convulsive delirium. High above, angels on mute pilgrimages between mist-bound aeries soared on wings of patchwork cartilage. From their vantage point, the constant motion of the aspirants was not the assemblage of thousands, but the handiwork of a great mover, the crafting of a single divine sigil umbilically writhing into existence. Back down upon the grounds of Elesh Norn's cathedral, chancellors swaddled in oil-soaked pinions and skitterlings possessed by ecstatic frenzy filed in and out of the Grand Annex like lathering maggots proclaiming the wisdom of their beloved Mother of Machines.</p>

<p>Exempt from these endless cycles were those chosen from the armored legions of the Alabaster Host to guard the avenues into and out of the cathedral proper. Their role, unlike all others in the Fair Basilica, was to stand perfectly, inhumanly still, for they were the unblinking gaze of the Mother herself. Woe be to the legionnaire who shirked this distinction to so much as wipe away a blemish on its armor.</p>

<p>So it was no surprise to Tezzeret when the twin centurions standing watch over the front gate didn't flinch when the Planar Bridge fractured, then tore open the hallowed space in front of them. He was once again on the accursed plane of New Phyrexia, the charred endoskeleton of Rona in his arms.</p>

<p>"I must see Mother," he barked to the guards, the energies from the Planar Bridge eating away his flesh like a murder of ravenous carrion birds. Neither moved nor acknowledged his presence. "Is she here or in the core?" Still no response. "Answer me, damn you!"</p>

<p>"Bring him to us," a voice boomed out. Her voice. "Send the other to Jin-Gitaxias for reconditioning." At that, the guards stepped aside, one taking Rona's remains away, and the other accompanying him on the long march through the internal courtyard. A steady hum filled the area, as did the stink of the sickly sweet, slightly acrid incense burning in the central brazier. There was a fervor that Tezzeret hadn't observed before, the thrill-engorged moments before a ritual sacrifice.</p>

<p>Tezzeret's journey ended inside a chamber held up by struts of bone-like porcelain flaring out from the walls, a set of ribs meeting in the center to form a dais of high steps leading up to the throne of Elesh Norn. A pair of gargantuan animarchs stopped their toiling at the back of the cavern to glare at Tezzeret's approach through the intercostal spaces.</p>

<p>"Honored Mother," he said, kneeling.</p>

<p>"We did not call for you," said Elesh Norn, her voice so loud it felt like it was bursting out of his head. "Why have you abandoned Dominaria?"</p>

<p>"Our forces were overwhelmed," Tezzeret began.</p>

<p>"Not possible. Our breadth is all-encompassing."</p>

<p>"So true, Mother. But<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> there was treachery. Rona, the one I arrived with—"</p>

<p>"One of Sheoldred's minions," said Elesh Norn. There was judgment in her voice as she rose from her seat and began to descend the steps. "Sheoldred, who is an apostate in our eyes! Her forces have moved against us in a reckless grasp at power. The flouting of our mercy despite the thanes' past transgressions<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> Such sacrilege pains us."</p>

<p>Tezzeret almost stumbled backward. Sheoldred? After the events on Dominaria, Tezzeret had been convinced that Sheoldred had been brought to heel—a wild, headstrong pet, but a pet nonetheless. He'd already planned to blame Rona for his failures. Sheoldred's betrayal was a delicious detail to add credibility to his cover story.</p>

<p>"Rona played her part in Sheoldred's plan perfectly, fooling even me. We were routed when our own troops turned on us."</p>

<p>"And the Planeswalkers?" Elesh Norn asked.</p>

<p>"Escaped."</p>

<p>"You did not follow?" Elesh Norn's shadow towered over him. Reflexively, his shoulders retreated inward, causing sharp jolts of pain from the Planar Bridge to spike, making him feel lightheaded.</p>

<p>"I would have, Mother," he said through gritted teeth. "But I needed to warn you of the snake in our midst. I was<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> concerned."</p>

<p>Norn was close enough now to lean forward, her arm extended, and tip Tezzeret's chin up with her finger. "You love us, don't you?"</p>

<p>One well-placed thrust of his sharpened arm could impale her head or take it right off. Would the sweetness of that action be worth the hell he'd face afterward? Death? If he was lucky. Torture? Still, preferable to what he suspected would truly unfold—the stretching and warping of his body and mind, the victory of the oil over his own tenacious spirit, the end of him and the beginning of his everlasting servitude. Like Tamiyo. Like Goldmane. Tezzeret closed his eyes and willed his heart to slow, concentrated on the sound of his breathing.</p>

<p>"What child does not love his mother?" he said, looking back up.</p>

<p>"Tell us then <em>child</em>. Tell us of the enemy."</p>

<p>"We encountered the Planeswalkers' new leader. She struck Rona with her terrifying weapon." Tezzeret watched Elesh Norn's ire fade, replaced with apprehension. "The leader's name is Elspeth Tirel." Tezzeret let the name linger. In other circumstances, witnessing the Mother of Machines genuinely fearful would have been a rare treat to savor. But the Planar Bridge was sapping away any pleasure he would have felt.</p>

<p>"The weapon—"</p>

<p>"A blade of gleaming white," said Tezzeret. "Like a shard of a star. We had no answer, just like we will have no answer when she arrives on New Phyrexia. You must agree that this is now an inevitability."</p>

<p>"We will be ready," Norn growled.</p>

<p>"None of us is ready. However, she has given up the advantage of surprise. We must take the opportunity—" Another wave of pain swept over Tezzeret, forcing him back onto his knees in faux-penitence. "The boon that was promised to me," he said, clutching his chest. "With a body of darksteel, I can be your invincible shield. Believe in me as I believe in you, Mother, and together, even the enemy's mighty general cannot conquer us."</p>

<p>Tezzeret's vision dimmed. He'd gone too long without his treatments in Kuldotha, and now he was wavering on the knife edge between life and death, dependent upon the mercy—and the gullibility—of the one being he hated most in the Multiverse. How fitting that he'd found himself again in this situation. How infuriating, as well. He fell onto the floor, onto his back, unable to focus past the invisible electric fire overtaking his body.</p>

<p>"You've carried such a burden for us," said Elesh Norn, caressing Tezzeret's cheek with her claw. "It is time to reward your faith. A promise is a promise." Elesh Norn's sickeningly haughty smile was the last thing he saw before he lost consciousness.</p>

<hr />

<p>The air was cold and wet and smelled of oil. Tezzeret's eyes shot open. Tentacle-like cables were coiled around his legs and arms, locking him into place. Looming over his head was an iridescent orb, pincers of hardened quicksilver jutting out from its sides like the legs of a mechanical spider.</p>

<p>"Stabilization procedures have been successful. Subject is regaining consciousness."</p>

<p><em>Jin-Gitaxias.</em> Tezzeret strained to take in as much of his surroundings as he could. He recognized the minutia of Jin-Gitaxias's dimly lit laboratory, a panoply of stasis tanks preserving slices of the plane's history. A metallic suit routinely worn by Neurok agents. A fist-sized, five-sided prism, dim yellow light oozing from its center like a darkened sun. The remains of a small black cube floating in suspension, dissected as if it were an animal to study.</p>

<p>"How long have I been asleep?" Tezzeret asked. His voice was hoarse, his throat dry.</p>

<p>"Long enough to prepare for the task delegated to me," said Jin-Gitaxias, stepping into view. He paused for a moment to study a tablet in his hand, a device he used to monitor the integrity of his lab apparatuses, then undulated his neck to look square at Tezzeret. "Embarking upon projects on short notice is imprudent. And at such a sensitive time. Elesh Norn's discretion is several percentiles less than acceptable."</p>

<p>So it was happening. His reward, finally here. Tezzeret would have felt more elated were he not bound in the seat where Tamiyo was cut open and flayed like an overripe fruit, her organs removed and replaced with glands that swam in oily ichor, an acid liver, bones of black metal. Beholding her rebirth as a Phyrexian, Tezzeret vowed that no such fate would befall him, that he'd die before he subjected himself to Jin-Gitaxias's mad experiments. But musing about death was not the same as facing it head on.</p>

<p>The door at the far end of the laboratory slid open with an almost imperceptible swish. In scuttled several tentacled skitterlings tugging a floating platform similar to the one Tezzeret had used to escort Karn's dismembered body to Elesh Norn's garden. Only, this platform bore something of much greater importance to him—the prize he'd long sought, streaks of gold swirling across and around its otherwise jet-black surface.</p>

<p>A body of darksteel. Cold. Indestructible. Invincible. Something welled in Tezzeret's chest, overcoming even the constant burn of the Planar Bridge against his flesh. Was it hope? Not at all. Such a delusion was fine for simpletons; Tezzeret had no use for it. What he had was <em>clarity</em>. There was nothing like desperation to renew one's conviction, to harden one's resolve.</p>

<p>"There are costs to working with darksteel," Jin-Gitaxias lectured in his characteristic monotone. "Once the metal has been forged, it must be shaped into its desired configuration immediately. The haste with which this is done inevitably requires lax standards in other areas. Urabrask condones such waste, but I do not."</p>

<p>"I am well aware," Tezzeret said, inwardly sneering at Jin-Gitaxias pretending to understand something he clearly did not. Tezzeret had seen enough in Urabrask's domain to know that the metal was not mined or shaped in any way remotely traditional. Forging darksteel lay in forging the <em>reality</em> around where the metal would be, presaging it so that it could be willed into shape. Tezzeret conjectured that the exact magical mechanism was a chance collision of rituals assembled over countless cycles—perhaps in part cribbed from Vulshok technique and in part from knowledge gained outside the plane long ago. Despite his insight, all his attempts at replicating it had failed. Tezzeret did not like it, was not comfortable with his own inability to grasp darksteel's secrets. But he'd learned to accept it.</p>

<p>"A lesson in efficiency," said Jin-Gitaxias, beckoning a pair of slug-like assistance drones to approach. "The etherium extracted from your husk will be shaped and charged to create a bonding force stabilizing your new form." The drones leaned forward, and from apertures on the tops of their heads came concentrated beams of energy directed at Tezzeret's metal arm.</p>

<p>At first, he felt nothing, but soon the sensation of slowly rising warmth gave way to searing heat where his arm met his organic shoulder. Tezzeret watched as the embodiment of his own exceptionalism melted into slag. Jin-Gitaxias collected it in a bowl and poured the superheated etherium into a narrow channel cut into the back of the darksteel body.</p>

<p>"This will remain a weakness in an otherwise impregnable form, but adequate precautions can mitigate the danger to yourself."</p>

<p><em>Ingenious</em>, Tezzeret thought. A lesser artificer would have tried to invent a more complex way to create the bond. All the better to impress an academy of simpering colleagues. Not Jin-Gitaxias. He understood that the elementary attraction of elements—of like clinging to like—was pure, inviolate, and unparalleled.</p>

<p>"Now," said Jin-Gitaxias. "Commence with the procedure."</p>

<p>The operator orb descended onto Tezzeret, a ring of pincers closing around his neck. Then the orb began its work, first by implanting microfilaments into his skin, each puncture like a dagger stroke. Surgical needles embedded in his seat did the same, knitting a weave of etherium strands around his spinal column. Tezzeret flexed his fingers, curled them into fists. A numbing thrum of energy began to course through the metal threads, causing a sudden bout of dizziness to wash over him.</p>

<p>Then his head and spine were separated from his body, now little more than a mass of scarred meat and scorched metal surrounding the Planar Bridge. The pain was magnitudes beyond any other he'd ever felt, so much so that visions began to flood his mind—pieces of a familiar fever dream he'd experienced when Bolas saved him from the brink of death. An ocean cloaked in cerulean haze. An island of metal, grasses of burnished pewter and tree leaves like age-tarnished razor blades. Mournful contrabasso chords growing into earsplitting peals—the chimes of a titanic clock.</p>

<p>Then<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> blackness. Silence.</p>

<p>Tezzeret opened his eyes to the glare of the lights overhead on the speckled marble slab. Did it work? Was he alive or dead? He wasn't sure. He focused on his fingertip upon the slab and marveled when it moved on command. Yes, he felt the muscles—if they could be called that—in his limbs bursting with a raw, physical strength he'd never known. More importantly, the burning of the Planar Bridge was gone, and his mind felt keener than it had in months, as if a diseased piece had been excised.</p>

<p>"You have outdone yourself," said Tezzeret.</p>

<p>"Negative," said Jin-Gitaxias, "This advancement was well within my abilities."</p>

<p>"In any case, my admiration for your skill is sincere," said Tezzeret. <em>As sincere as my contempt for your loathsome plane and everything on it.</em> At that, he willed himself to enter the Blind Eternities, this time as a man reforged. He relished the thought of visiting restitution upon all who had wronged him, then amassing power to attain his proper place in the pantheon of the Multiverse.</p>

<p>Except, he didn't move. There was no characteristic snap of the universal edges parting, no bout of momentary queasiness that routinely accompanied his planeswalking. Tezzeret flexed his limbs, but the clamps around his wrists and ankles were made of the same unbreakable darksteel that now composed his body. It was then that he noticed a thin inlay of rippling silver metal fed into shallow crevices stretching across the marble slab he lay on. He cursed, recalling how Karn had been prevented from saving himself. Tezzeret had fallen into the same trap.</p>

<p>"Release me at once!" Tezzeret attempted to planeswalk away again, and again he failed. "Do you hear me?"</p>

<p>"Darksteel has another drawback," said Jin-Gitaxias, paying no heed to Tezzeret's cries. "The conversion to blightsteel requires weeks, if not months, of exposure to the glistening oil." With a click of his claws, the praetor called the operator orb back down to hover near his shoulder. He tapped the orb, causing a slithery tentacle to emerge from within its nest of appendages. "Fortunately, advancements have been made to minimize this issue as it pertains to the task at hand." The tentacle unfolded, revealing a small module at its tip.</p>

<p>The Reality Chip, a new version dripping with glistening oil.</p>

<p>"This was not part of my agreement with our Mother!" screamed Tezzeret. "Her wrath will rain down upon your head!"</p>

<p>"There is no violating an agreement already broken." Jin-Gitaxias gestured toward the far wall, which slid open to reveal a tank of blue liquid. Suspended inside was the body of one of Urabrask's chief lieutenants, a scrapchief, its arms stretched away from its body like a spider being pulled apart. He knew. Jin-Gitaxias knew about it all—Urabrask, the Mirrans, the impending attacks. Everything. "Such developments do not displease me. They introduce possibilities intriguing enough to let them unfold as they will."</p>

<p><em>His own play for the throne</em>, thought Tezzeret.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, I regret not feeding your tissues to my larvae upon our first encounter. But, as oversights can be corrected, so too can the treasonous be<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> What is Elesh Norn's nomenclature? Ah. <em>Forgiven.</em>"</p>

<p>Tezzeret tried again to break his bonds, casting spells in every direction he could. But with each incantation, the metal inlay on the slab would flare, changing color from silver to a bright opalescence, siphoning away the energy he needed to escape. Still, he kept casting, desperate for anything that could penetrate the dampening field.</p>

<p>Something did. <em>Planeswalker</em>, he heard a presence speak, a voice that boiled with the rage of Phyrexia's forges, albeit one nearly extinguished from exhaustion. <em>How do you reach into my mind?</em></p>

<p>It had been so long since Tezzeret had initiated contact with a telemin that he had almost forgotten how. Less a true spell than an Esper mentalist's trick, establishing a mental bond in this way allowed the caster to assume total control of another individual, provided full permission had been granted. Useless against an enemy. But in a situation such as the present one, it was exactly the improvised weapon he needed.</p>

<p><em>Give me control</em>, <em>Phyrexian</em>, thought Tezzeret. <em>I am your only means of salvation, and you mine. Otherwise, we both end here.</em> There was an initial resistance by the scrapchief—a natural reflex—which quickly gave way to Tezzeret's psyche melding into his new host. He could feel the creature's flagging rage, like a smoldering furnace, and stoked it with his own.</p>

<p>Beholding Jin-Gitaxias standing over his body through the transparent wall of the scrapchief's prison, Tezzeret aimed a single hit onto the glass with the creature's sharpened upper jaw. He struck it again and again, each time widening the fracture until the tank exploded in a hail of shrapnel.</p>

<div class="figure-wrapper">

</div>

<p>Tezzeret drove the scrapchief forward, ramming Jin-Gitaxias onto the ground, knocking the Reality Chip from his grip. Given different circumstances, Tezzeret's next step would have been to beat Jin-Gitaxias mercilessly. To break him. Instead, he commanded the scrapchief to charge past and bring the full weight of its heavy, metal-capped arm onto the marble slab, punching a hole straight through. Again and again. The more damage to the slab—and to the lattice on its surface—the stronger Tezzeret's connection to magic. He raised the scrapchief's arms overhead for one final smash when pain ripped through his—or rather, the scrapchief's—back. Looking down, he saw the claw of Jin-Gitaxias protruding through the scrapchief's chest.</p>

<p>Tezzeret's mind snapped back into his own body in time to see Jin-Gitaxias throw the scrapchief's corpse down to the ground, a lifeless pile in front of him. No words came out of the praetor's mouth. The time had passed for intellectual cogitations; both praetor and Planeswalker understood this. One moved—Jin-Gitaxias lunged forward, armed with the Reality Chip—and so did the other.</p>

<p>Tezzeret planeswalked away.</p>

<hr />

<p><em>Filth. Darkness. Desolation.</em> Many words have been said of Tidehollow, the forsaken underground where the Esper elite relegated the dregs who reminded them of their sins. <em>Tidehollow the heartless! Tidehollow the unmerciful!</em> The longer you lived there, the longer and more complex the phrasing. <em>Tidehollow, who impales the skulls of the forgotten with spikes of machined perfection! Tidehollow, whose plumes of trash fire soot gag the toxic hopes of the young, the acidic pleas of the old! Tidehollow with teeth like window shards, sarcophagus bones hollowed of marrow and force-fed to infants!</em></p>

<p>Tezzeret, on his knees, dug between hunks of broken pavement and scraped up the dirt underneath. He brought the soot and soil up to his face, smelled the blood, the sick, the hopelessness. Then he leaned back and howled with laughter. The poets could choke on their verses. For Tezzeret, there was only one word associated with Tidehollow that truly resonated.</p>

<p><em>Home</em>.</p>

<p>"Oy!" he heard a voice say behind him. It echoed off the walls of the condemned buildings lining the grimy alleyway. "Looks like someone's had too much of the piss. Probably don't have a lot left in your pockets, but we'll take what you got!"</p>

<p>Tezzeret turned his head to see a gang of cave brats, the tallest and oldest out front armed with a knife. He had the steely look of someone who'd been on his end of a weapon before, who'd carried out forced transactions like those up in Vectis enjoyed their afternoon tea. Long ago, before planeswalking dragons, plane-churning confluxes, and biomechanical scourges, Tezzeret dressed in the same tatters, bore the same scowl on his face that these youths now wore on theirs.</p>

<p>"I am at a moment of weakness," Tezzeret said, calmly. "I will permit you to leave."</p>

<p>"I think we'll stay, thank you very much!" said a girl, the lead boy's second-in-command, Tezzeret guessed. "What are those things floating around him?"</p>

<p>The lead boy smirked. "Magic. Decorations rich folks spend a fortune on." He jabbed his knife in Tezzeret's direction. "C'mon. Give us your stuff, and you won't get hurt."</p>

<p>"I have nothing for you."</p>

<p>"I'll be the judge of that," said the lead boy.</p>

<p>"You would judge me? What makes you think you're worthy?"</p>

<p>"Got a knife in my hand, see?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Tezzeret. Then, in one movement, he turned, stood, and cast a spell to animate the knife in the leader's hand. It wrested itself from the boy's grip and then plunged into his palm, nearly severing his fingers entirely. "I see."</p>

<p>"Aether lich!" the girl screamed, sparking a stampede, the lead boy holding his wrist as he scampered away. The gang scattered, its bigger members trampling over the smaller ones who made up the back ranks, leaving behind a lone, blond child, pushed down into the gutter by his erstwhile fellows. The boy huddled against a nearby building—one that Tezzeret recognized. He'd brought himself to the threshold of his childhood home, the abysmal station he'd been born into.</p>

<p>"Why is this building boarded up?" Tezzeret asked the boy. "And what of the man who lived here?"</p>

<p>"No one's ever lived here, far as I know."</p>

<p>Had his father died? It wouldn't have been surprising. When he wasn't cursing other scrappers for "stealing his rightful claim" or screaming at his son to allay his frustrations, he was in his cups babbling to the phantom of his dead wife—Tezzeret's mother—before passing out in a pool of his own vomit. Before he knew better, a young Tezzeret would wait until his father was asleep, then wipe the table dry and lay his father down upon his cot with blanket drawn. <em>Imbecile.</em> He'd merely enabled his father's cruelty toward him. Only when Tezzeret was older, after he'd learned about the power of mages, did he see the role he played in his own suffering.</p>

<p>"What is your name, boy?"</p>

<p>"Estel," the young man stammered out.</p>

<p>"Come."</p>

<p>Tezzeret tried to reshape his arm into a bent edge to pry off the wooden panels nailed across the doorway, only for his body to ignore his command. He grunted, realizing that for all the strengths of his new form, there were tradeoffs. <em>With time</em>, he thought as he tore the panels down as if they were scraps of paper.</p>

<p>Inside didn't look much different from what he remembered. Two rooms, one a kitchen area with a shallow fireplace and a table and the other used as sleeping quarters. Both were stripped of anything of value. The only things visible implying his father's existence were bits of twisted metal—all cheap alloys—scattered across the floor and a heavy cloak that smelled of mold and sawdust.</p>

<p>But what of things invisible? Tezzeret pushed the table aside and, counting three tiles from the back wall, he inserted a finger into the crack between the third and fourth. Underneath was a small metal door locked with a heavy deadbolt.</p>

<p>Tezzeret ripped the door off its hinges, reached in, and pulled out a small wooden box with floral patterns carved onto its lid. This was his mother's handiwork, the last remnant of the hobby that gave her solace amid the squalor. He remembered hugging the box on the journey up to Lower Vectis to collect his mother's corpse, how his fingernail fit perfectly into the shallow grooves of the carving. He remembered her promise that morning to return with supper—a promise, he supposed, she'd intended to keep.</p>

<p>Witnesses told a familiar tale. She'd been begging for alms when a wealthy guildmaster's wagon hit her and didn't stop. Of course, the authorities did nothing. Humiliation and death were common enough occurrences for downslopers like her. Long after and armed with his Seeker training, Tezzeret searched out his mother's killer, only to find that he'd died years before, peacefully, surrounded by his loving family.</p>

<p><em>Tidehollow, whose claws of rags and misery drag dreams to ash!</em></p>

<p>"Do you know what this is?" Tezzeret asked Estel after cracking open the box for the boy to see. Inside were metallic scraps of all shapes—nuggets, shavings, irregular threads.</p>

<p>"Etherium," Estel answered, shriveling under the Planeswalker's gaze.</p>

<p>"This paltry amount is worth more than all the denizens of Tidehollow combined, anything that you are now or will be in the future." Tezzeret began to shape a spell, murmuring words he'd learned long ago as a member of the Seekers. "Its value is derived from its extreme rarity, its inability to be reproduced. At least, that's what you're told." He let his hand drop, the etherium suspended in the air, and watched as the liquid metal reformed itself into a thin square. "Those in Tidehollow need little motivation to fight among ourselves for the scraps we're allowed to have. All the better for those above. It keeps us out of their way." Letters began to raise themselves onto its surface, Tezzeret's mind pressing the metal into a message.</p>

<p>Tezzeret took the etherium, curled it into a tight tube, and placed it back into the box. He looked to Estel and intended to place it in his hands when thunder tore through the air, the sound of steel doors being wrenched apart.</p>

<p>Tezzeret ducked outside to see an angular crack, flaring with bright crackles of energy, breaking the cave ceiling. Tearing through it was a column of white material that he at first thought was a building falling through from the city above. But upon closer inspection, he spotted creatures moving across the column's surface, scampering down like insects to street level. Then he realized what he was looking at.</p>

<p>Bone-white metal. The Phyrexians had arrived.</p>

<p>"Too soon," Tezzeret snarled. He clutched Estel's arm and dragged him inside the hovel. He forced the boy to take the box, then spotted the small dagger strapped to the boy's belt. "Give me your knife."</p>

<p>With a shaking hand, Estel drew the knife from its sheath. Tezzeret grabbed it and looked it over. Cheap make. Loose handle. Chipped tip. Still, it would suffice for Tezzeret's ends. A beginner's spell solidified the knife's handle; another filed the edge down until it was sharp and tapered. One last enchantment made it quasi-ethereal such that its cutting edge could cleave through a well-forged sword.</p>

<p>"The cistern at Bellow's End," he said. "Do you know of it? There is a passage leading to a forgotten house in Upper Vectis."</p>

<p>"Aye. We use it to watch the parades."</p>

<p><em>As did I in my youth.</em> "Go there—stick to the Shadow Way, the narrowed passages."</p>

<p>"How do you know—"</p>

<p>"Be quiet and listen. You are to leave the city, taking supplies as you come across them. Do not stop moving. If something gets in your way, use this." Tezzeret placed Estel's refashioned knife back into its sheath. "Make your way to Bant."</p>

<p>"Bant?"</p>

<p>"Follow the shoreline northward, keeping the silver wind at your back to guide you to Valeron. Approach the first outpost you see and find the knight decorated with the most sigils. Request an audience with Knight-General Rafiq and give him the box. Am I clear?"</p>

<p>The boy nodded, but his expression was one of worry and confusion, exacerbated by the shouts and screams—not to mention the inhuman roars—from outside. "What is happening? What were those things? Who are you?"</p>

<p>"I am the one giving you a chance to live," he said. "When you see Rafiq, tell him that an ally of Elspeth Tirel sent you."</p>

<p>Tezzeret pushed Estel away, and the boy turned to leave. But before exiting, he looked back, nodded, and said, "Thank you."</p>

<p>"Wasted words," he spat, heat rising behind his eyes.</p>

<p>"But sir—"</p>

<p>"Just go!" he screamed, prompting Estel to run out the door. Tezzeret stood, his body trembling. <em>I have not fully recovered from the grafting</em>, he told himself as he regained his composure. <em>If the boy dies, he dies.</em> Death would have been Estel's destiny anyway had he stayed in Tidehollow. But if he managed to live, if he got word to the Knights of Bant that they alone possessed a way to defend themselves—a legion of angelic warriors, just as New Capenna once boasted—then Alara could become a quagmire slowing the Phyrexians' spread. All the more time to re-establish his networks, gain resources, and enact his plans.</p>

<p>Tezzeret donned his father's cloak—a menial disguise, but it sufficed—and then, for the briefest of moments, stared back at the dingy hole where he was born and raised. Flecks of rotten wood and plaster rained down from the ceiling as the air filled with noises of slaughter and mayhem. <em>A fitting goodbye</em>, he thought as he entered the Blind Eternities.</p>

<hr />

<p>Tezzeret's travels took him to plane after plane transformed, ripped apart by invading hordes of Phyrexians. Sabers snapping upon iron-clad carapaces, monstrous incisors grinding bone, and near-constant weeping seemed to bridge planes, blending into an uninterrupted symphony of suffering.</p>

<p>Elesh Norn's "great work" was unfolding faster than Tezzeret could have imagined. Aranzhur. Ilcae. Obsidias. All planes that contained safehouses set up by Baltrice, his second-in-command in the Infinite Consortium. Their existence—and hers, for that matter—was one of the few shreds of specific knowledge Beleren had left behind when he scraped out Tezzeret's mind in the Nezumi swamps. But there was nothing safe about these planes anymore. They'd become mere extensions of New Phyrexia, fresh blossoms on Elesh Norn's debased World Tree. Other planes—Mirrankkar, Cabralin—were in the process of being subsumed. Their inhabitants would fight back, only to fail and become one with the Machine Legion.</p>

<p>Tezzeret had no choice but to keep moving. One more plane held a safehouse he could use as a refuge, though it was a place he was hesitant to return to. But he'd run out of alternatives. To his relief, there was no sign of invasion—at least an overt one—among the bustle at dusk of Towashi's narrow streets. Gone was the tension fueled by the recent Upriser aggression, leaving the people to resume their normal, dismal lives.</p>

<p>Unaware. Cattle fit for slaughtering.</p>

<p>No matter. Tezzeret's concern was finding the safehouse, resting, and claiming what materials Baltrice had stashed there. Unfortunately, the snaking layers of gridwork that marked the Towashi Undercity had proven as formidable a barrier to his reprieve as a Phyrexian horde.</p>

<p>"Where is it?" he muttered, emerging from yet another alleyway back onto the street. Tezzeret stiffened the hood of his cloak and kept his face low. Surveillance was everywhere. He'd long been unwelcome in most parts of Kamigawa, and he had no doubt that his enemies had renewed their hunt for him after his most recent stint on the plane.</p>

<p>He continued walking until he found himself in Dragon's Well, one of the lowest sections of the Undercity, an area forever shielded from the sunlight by a matrix of bridges that serviced those who worked and lived in Towashi's skyscrapers. It was a logical place for the safehouse's location. Out of sight. Buried. Forgotten by all but the Undercity's biker gangs that eke out a meager existence in petty crime. Somewhere Tezzeret would have chosen—perhaps a location he <em>did</em> choose but could no longer remember. He placed his hands on the support column of a bridge and murmured a rhabdomantic spell, sending his mind sizzling through the metal in search of a doorway with the Consortium's magical imprint.</p>

<p>"It is you<nbsp> . . .</nbsp>" he heard someone say, a split second before feeling a surge of electricity overtake him. Tezzeret suddenly felt helpless to gravity, the weight of his body toppling him over like a tipped statue. It took all his strength to reach backward, where he felt a blade piercing the threadbare cloth of his father's cloak, penetrating the soft etherium in the middle of his back. Lucky shot—or unlucky, as it were. A bright light then burst out of the darkness, shining down upon him from atop a hovering surveillance drone, its cannon still smoking from a recently fired shot. Stepping out from the periphery was a Nezumi, young from his stature, with gray-spotted, white fur unlike most of his brethren.</p>

<p>"Where is she?"</p>

<p>Tezzeret groaned and attempted to planeswalk away. But his mind was too scrambled to escape or to cast spells. He reached back again, this time tapping the shaft of the blade with his fingertips.</p>

<p>"Tamiyo," the Nezumi continued. "Tell me where she is." He raised a control rod, using it to command the drone to lower. "Is she<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> dead?" With a click, the cannon chamber loaded with another shot trained on Tezzeret's head. "Tell me now!"</p>

</div>

<p>"What is she to you, rat whelp?" Tezzeret said, with a dry grunt. "You're her champion? Her hero swooping in to save her from the darkness?"</p>

<p>"My mother." <em>Mother.</em> Of course. Tamiyo's "family," as she would endlessly drone about. It was never quiet with her around—her inane singing, a broken music box stuck in an endless loop. <em>Genku, my love, I will come back for you. Hiroku, my love, I will see you again. Rumiyo, my love, we shall embrace. Nashi, my love, not of my blood, but of my heart</em><nbsp> . . .</nbsp> Yes, Nashi. That was his name. "I saw you die once for burning my village to the ground," he said, his arm wavering, fingers positioned on the buttons of the control rod. "Tell me where she is, or you'll die again."</p>

<p><em>Full circle.</em> Tezzeret looked up and stared into the boy's eyes. "Then do it."</p>

<p>Nashi's hand shook. "I swear<nbsp> . . .</nbsp>"</p>

<p>"Do it! What are you waiting for, you coward?!" A dam broke inside Tezzeret. He reached backward one more time, feeling his fingers elongate and wrap around the blade lodged in his back. He wrenched the blade out and threw it at Nashi's drone, knocking it askew enough that the cannon shot far wide of its target. Shadows danced. Nashi tried to bolt away, but Tezzeret was faster, snatching him by the collar of his leather jacket and dragging him to the ground. "You pathetic weakling!" Tezzeret, in control of his faculties once more, lifted Nashi with one arm and threw him against the bridge support. "Fate handed vengeance to you, and you squandered it! Few <em>ever</em> get that chance!" Tezzeret picked Nashi up again and pinned him to the wall. The boy was battered, red patches sunk into his fur like blood on snow. "In this life, you take what you deserve! Others will try to stop you, so you stop them first! You <em>kill</em> them first!"</p>

<p>The rumble of engines erupted all around Tezzeret. He turned just as light flooded the area from more than a dozen motorbikes forming a semicircle around him. No exit.</p>

<p>"Let him go," ordered the leader, a female Nezumi atop a bike styled like a dragon.</p>

<p>"This is no concern of yours."</p>

<p>"Yes, it is—he's one of ours," the leader said. "You're outnumbered. Let him go, or else."</p>

<p>Tezzeret dropped Nashi in front of his feet. More threats. Always threats that tasked him for a response. Very well. Metal would be his answer, brutal and precise. <em>For hate's sake.</em> With that thought, he expanded his magic out past himself in all directions—into the bridges that spanned the iron firmament above his head, into the ground to contact deposits of ore deep underneath them. Perhaps detecting something amiss, the leader ordered three of her henchmen to dismount from their bikes and approach.</p>

<p>Too late. Tezzeret twitched, making the short blades in the henchmen's hands move of their own accord, impaling their wielders and dragging them away from the light. The rest of the Nezumi mounted their bikes again and revved the engines to ready for a charge. Another futile effort. Each of their mechanical steeds was a magnificent work, an artifact in its own right, gleaming and powerful and <em>metal</em>. Raising his hand in front of his face, palm up, Tezzeret slowly squeezed his fingers together.</p>

<p>Realization hit the gang members seconds after, as their bikes began to shake. Some tried to jump off, only to find that the metal on their persons—weapons, buckles, and pins on their clothing—had fused to their bikes, shackling them in place. They could do nothing when, all at once, Tezzeret clenched his fingers into a tight fist, lifting the bikes into the air and then slamming them together with a gruesome crunch. He gazed at the mass of metal and flesh, used his magic to rotate it in the scant light of Nashi's grounded drone. Shrieks of incredible pain. Fractured limbs skewered by chrome shafts glittering in the darkness like a jewel.</p>

<p>A false jewel. A curse masked as treasure. No, true power was not in either of these—in amassing armies or gathering weapons. It was in surviving, in thriving, in outliving all those who had ever come after him. With a shred of his will, Tezzeret sent the mass of crushed metal and bodies careening into the dark, where it collided with a far wall.</p>

<p>Then all was quiet. He looked down where Nashi lay, crouched down, and cradled the boy's head in his hand. Nashi wrapped his fingers around Tezzeret's wrist, the half-congealed blood on his palms leaving a residue, black and viscous upon Tezzeret's darksteel skin.</p>

<p>"Your mother still lives."</p>

<p>"Alive," Nashi gasped, the smallest sliver of a smile flashing across his face.</p>

<p>Tezzeret nodded. "She will come for you soon enough." He leaned in closer. "And when she does, you will wish I had killed her." Gently, he placed Nashi's head onto the ground, stood up, and walked away.</p>

<hr />

<p>The safehouse was located behind a false wall in a gaming parlor, bright and raucous, where people from the lower strata of Kamigawan society sunk their money into machines promising riches but delivering little more than flashing lights and clanking sounds. It shouldn't have surprised Tezzeret. Baltrice always had a penchant for such frivolities.</p>

<p>Inside, he found exactly what he was looking for. A private place to rest. To strategize. To ruminate. The supplies were also most welcome: a new suit of light armor, the spine and neck area of which he magically reinforced; several denominations of currency from many different planes; a manablade—one of the very few not in the possession of the Church of the Incarnate Soul; and last, a small crystal that, when held, projected a pattern of pinpoint lights onto the wall, an esoteric telemetry that rekindled a memory long snuffed out.</p>

<p>Tezzeret planeswalked from Kamigawa to a plane so forlorn that even he did not know its name. The journey—the flexing of a neglected muscle still retaining the imprint of endless practice—found him standing amid an ocean of sand. In the distance rose a shallow hill made of seamless metal, and emerging from its top was a single spiked tower. Once, this was his tower, the base of operations from which he steered the fortunes of other planes as the shadowy leader of the Infinite Consortium.</p>

<p>"Smart, Beleren, to keep this from me," Tezzeret mused. "But no longer."</p>

<p>As Tezzeret began his trek forward, he pondered the battle happening across other planes—Beleren and his cohort against Elesh Norn. They would reach the end soon, the stage when both opponents would unleash their final salvos against each other. This was always the most important part of the game—one he was glad to sit out. Eventually, one of them would be victorious but weakened. Then—and only then—would he make his move.</p>

<p>In the meantime, there was much rebuilding to do.</p>

<p>A little crab walked over Teferi's hand.</p>

<p>The waves—what did he say?</p>

<p><em>"I think our time is up," Urza said, pointing into a void above Teferi's head. "I can see something out there."</em></p>

<p>The Destroyer of Dominaria talking with the Destroyer of Zhalfir—always in that goat's shadow, old man. Wonder what he saw out there.</p>

<p>Get up. Get off the beach. Forget it. Blink, and it's gone. This is probably the second time you died, but anyway, you're back now—what are you going to do about it?</p>

<p>There is a war coming. What are you going to do about it?</p>

</div>

<p>Naked, alone, Teferi walked inland from the beach.</p>

<p>The day was mild and warm. The sun shone through a low bank of clouds or fog on the horizon—hazy, gold, diffused. The memory of a sun, how Teferi saw the light in his dreams.</p>

<p>Teferi paused where the sand gave way to tough coastal grass and the leading edges of a dune forest. The wind was steady off the water. Fine grains of sand brushed his ankles. There was a stone arch here, red stone from somewhere else, blasted by grains of sand dragged daily across it for untold time. Regular depressions in the arch's surface may once have been writing, language, a marker of where he was, but were too worn now to say anything. Beyond was a well-traveled trail, marked by standing columns and the root nubs of others that had toppled.</p>

<p>Teferi leaned against the stone arch, catching his breath. Pain flooded in where moments ago there had only been pleasant nothing. Breathing hurt. His lungs felt tight, banded, like he'd just finished running for miles. His body ached. From core to extremity, he felt wrung, like a wet rag twisted dry.</p>

<p>What did he know? Teferi's thoughts raced as he took inventory.</p>

<p>You're no longer connected to Kaya. You're whole, not a spirit anymore, which means something happened on their end to make you wind up like this on your end. Wasn't planned, wasn't accounted for: not good. Try to get back.</p>

<p>Teferi reached out, reached <em>in</em>, summoned up the familiar movement of a planeswalk and found nothing. A limp twitch, the spasm of a numb limb. He squatted down, turned, and sat. A wave of panic, nausea. He rested his head against the archway and stared out to sea, squinting to see through the day's light and glittering water.</p>

<p>A haze clung to the horizon. The waves were gentle, crumbling instead of crashing, rolling up the beach where shorebirds and crabs scuttled, dancing, hunter and prey. Distant, Teferi thought. Beautiful, like nothing at all.</p>

<p>He watched the light over the ocean. He reached out to an imagined sun and willed it to plunge below the hidden horizon, for day to slip effortlessly into night. Time did not respond to his will. He dropped his hand back into his lap.</p>

<p>"That's it," Teferi said aloud, speaking to the wind, the birds, and the crabs. "They win."</p>

<hr />

<p>Night fell. Teferi slept. The cicadas' calls were buzzsaws, nightmares. He dreamed things he won't remember but will carry with him when he wakes up:</p>

<p>Kroog. A field of mud scarred with trenches, a pox-marked face leering up from Dominaria's darkest history, crater lips wet with fresh and rotting and reanimated dead, wires running under its skin. Argoth, burning, streaked in oil, elves and humans crushed under the feet of metal beasts, whose buzzsaws rattled his molars, who were just the cicadas outside of his dreaming.</p>

<p>Things he will remember when he wakes:</p>

<p>The cold pressure when the Phyrexian stabbed him. The dark halls of Urza's Tower under siege reminded him of the halls of Tolaria all those years ago, fire-lit, chorused with agonies.</p>

<p>What hurts the most:</p>

<p>Subira doesn't wander anymore; he does that now. See you on the road sometime, Subi.</p>

<hr />

<p>A cold fog rolled in off the sea, prickling Teferi's skin to gooseflesh. He woke to see the tide had come in, and where the waves had crumbled, they now crashed, silver-blue dark under the moonlight.</p>

<p>Teferi picked himself up. There were no moons. Nevertheless, pale blue light illuminated the landscape, hard-edged. Odd, but he needed to move. Head somewhere inland, warmer. Follow the tracks. Where there's people there's hope—people must eat, must sleep, must laugh. Must have a spare set of clothes as well, he thought, as he hugged himself against the cold. He rubbed his arms to build some heat and followed the path inland. The dune forest protected him from the worst of the wind, and the farther he walked, the warmer the night grew, the more still the air. The rich odor of rotting wood, tidal wetland, life, and death.</p>

<p>Teferi emerged from the dune forest into a scrubland dominated by low, wide-canopied trees. Insects and the wind filled the night, a sound so droning that it may as well have been silence. By the hazy, non-moonlight, he could see the landscape rolling away into the far distance, dark features breaking the horizon into a lumpen border—mountains, low and old, many miles away.</p>

<p>The path continued here, more defined. The pale sand shone like a beacon under the moonlight, a ribbon that stretched for a dozen yards into the grassland before giving way to a packed-earth path, rutted with light cart tracks, dry veins further eroded by the rain.</p>

<p>Teferi crouched down and reached out to the sand. He hovered a hand over an old footprint and, with a slow, looping gesture, reached into time, pulling history from the dust.</p>

<p>People came here, once. The beach beyond the dune forest used to be a happy place, where families would spend long afternoons relaxing in and near the gentle surf. Children would run screaming with joy down this path, jumping as they passed under the red archway, hoping to grow tall enough one day to slap the keystone at its zenith. Parents followed, hauling hand carts or soft knit bags filled with the day's supplies: dried and cold provisions, water, blankets, written stories, baskets in case they found mussels or caught small fish, coins to haggle with the vendors that patrolled the shore.</p>

<p>Teferi closed his eyes. With his other hand, he described a larger loop. Casting the net wider, back to the breakers and the water's edge. Visions came to him like memory, like dreams.</p>

<p>Long, wide-bellied, brightly painted fishing boats once lined the beach. By the afternoon, most of the sailors would have returned with their catches and made their way to the markets farther inland. Some would lounge on the beach with their lovers and friends, others might stay behind, chipping barnacles or painting fresh color onto the curved hulls of their boats. Huge nets fluttered from drying towers. Some of the laborers and sailors slept the long day off here, in the shade under their belly-up vessels, under the soft rain and heady ocean scent of their drying nets.</p>

<p>Another rotation. Bring the past closer.</p>

<p>Fewer families came here. Those that did walked together, close together, and some of the parents wore old weapons—daggers, staffs of hard wood capped in iron. The boats did not have any barnacles on them, and their paint was sun-bleached. It had been some time since any sailors had taken them out to sea; the older hulls were beginning to crack. The nets, hung to dry, had whitened, stiffened, grown brittle. The sailors didn't take their nets out anymore because they didn't need them. The sailors' fear was the same as the parents' fear, and it was Teferi's fear, the same that wriggled around at the base of his skull, that inner voice that whispered: be afraid of the sea. Be afraid of the night. Be afraid of what you can't see.</p>

<p>Another rotation. Closer.</p>

<p>Fear. The buzzing of insects in the present blended with the crashing of waves back then and the horrible sound of screams high on the sea-borne gale. Cataclysm. The ground shook under the stampede. The ground reached up, lurching, moving.</p>

<p>Another.</p>

<p>Empty. Rain washed over waves that beat against the flanks of the dunes.</p>

<p>Another.</p>

<p>The beach returned. The water was still as glass. A gentle wind tousled the dune grass, and then died.</p>

<p>Another.</p>

<p>At the far end of the path, at the edge of where Teferi's recall failed and the darkness became absolute, a finger of mist probed forward. It curled, then faded, plucked by an unfelt wind.</p>

<p>The path had a heartbeat of its own, once: the footfalls of people bound for the sea and those returning home. Wrenn would have called it a song, Teferi thought. He stood and closed his spell. The stink of chronomancy faded. Teferi looked behind him. The path, too, was a body. A dead body he knew, stretching toward a distant horizon, beyond which there was nothing. A void, empyrean, severed from time and everything else.</p>

<p>Zhalfir. Nearly four hundred years later, he was back in Zhalfir.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Zhalfir</strong></p>

<p>Miles inland, the simple path Teferi followed joined with a broad, cobblestone road, running horizon to horizon, parallel to the coast. Without the sea breeze, the night clung to the day's heat. Tall grass lined the road, and the calls of insects drowned out thought.</p>

<p>Teferi, with little direction, turned to the left and started walking.</p>

<p>Hours later as dawn approached, the clattering of carts and hooves woke him. Teferi had settled just off the road to sleep; he could not now. Aching, he moved closer, using the thick brush for cover, and watched as a caravan trundled past.</p>

<p>It was a long train of ten wagons each pulled by a gang of docile beasts—oxen or buffalo. Caravanners rode atop the wagons on shaded benches and wore light, layered clothing, cloaks in earthy tones of green and red. Their demeanor was calm, if tired—many held steaming mugs of coffee or some other hot drink. Teferi guessed them to be the day shift, having risen within the hour to take over from their compatriots who now slept in the tall, canvas-covered carts among the boxes and sacks of goods they transported. He waited, watching the lead carts roll by, taking measure of the armored guards that rode in the rear, some asleep sitting up, lashed to the support beams of their wagon so they did not tumble out. These guards were not the akinji that Teferi remembered—their armor was not uniform, their weapons were plain iron, and they wore undyed cloaks. Likely road-bound mercenaries hired cheaply by the caravanners.</p>

<p>Teferi's stomach growled. He was shaking, he realized. Hungry, tired, thirsty, lost—he was alone. He needed help, he needed to risk trust.</p>

<p>Teferi let another wagon pass, and then stepped out onto the road.</p>

<p>"Hello," Teferi called to the approaching caravanner. He raised a hand and waved.</p>

<p>The approaching caravanner screamed, waking her co-pilot with a start. He jumped, flailing his arms, knocking his companion's coffee into the air. The oxen hauling the cart were unfazed, happy to come to a stop. The lead bull snorted, swung its head to look at Teferi, and blinked.</p>

<p>The commotion brought the caravan to a halt. Shouts, cries of "halt!" and "attack!" rang out up and down the line of wagons, and with a great cacophony, the guards spilled out of their posts, some tangling themselves in their sleeping lines, most moving with enough speed that they had Teferi surrounded and at spearpoint within the minute.</p>

<p>"Who are you, naked man?" One of the guards shouted. She was a hoarse-voiced woman around Teferi's age in used but well-maintained armor. A fur collar over a repaired royal blue cloak marked her as once being a member of a warband. Likely the leader of this party, then. Like the rest of her guards, she held her spear aimed at Teferi's chest.</p>

<p>"A traveler," Teferi said. "I was attacked by bandits," Teferi lied. "Two days ago, near the coast. They took my clothing and my food and left me for dead. Please—if you have anything you can spare."</p>

<p>The guard leader relaxed. "Bandits," she said, waving for her compatriots to stand down. "Someone find him a cloak. Near the coast? Then don't worry, traveler—they won't trouble you anymore. We dealt with that clutch of traitors just last night."</p>

<p>"You did?" Teferi asked. He hid his surprise well. One of the guards passed him a spare cloak. Teferi pulled it on, taking a moment to look over the guards. Many wore bandages around their limbs, sides, and heads. It had been a rough fight.</p>

<p>"They're getting bold now," the guard leader grimaced. "People can't live under a hanging sword—they get angry. Hungry. No stomach for sacrifice."</p>

<p>"Times are hard," Teferi agreed. No stomach for sacrifice? How long had it really been for them, he wondered—moments, or years?</p>

<p>The leader looked down, firm, considering her next words. "We didn't find any of your party alive," she said. Direct, matter of fact. "Their bodies are in the last cart—we're taking them back to Kiingal. You can come with us and speak for them." The guard leader nodded. The decision made, she clipped a short, sharp whistle: back to work. As the caravan got underway, she started walking and motioned for Teferi to follow.</p>

<p>Teferi fell in line, holding his cloak closed. The dawn had fully broken now, and the day's heat rose with the sun.</p>

<p>"You look familiar," the guard leader said. "I am Eshe. Where are you from? What is your name?"</p>

<p>"Sefu," Teferi lied again. "I'm from Kipamu. I have one of those faces," Teferi said, smiling. "It makes me a good trader—everyone trusts their friend."</p>

<p>"Indeed."</p>

<p>Eshe and Teferi walked in silence, keeping a steady, comfortable pace alongside the large, rolling carts.</p>

<p>"You haven't asked about the dead."</p>

<p>"The dead?"</p>

<p>"Your comrades," Eshe said. "How many of them were there, again?"</p>

<p><em>Damn.</em> Teferi couldn't turn and check, the cart was too far back. Instead, working quickly, he channeled a subtle spell and pulled the answer from Eshe's memory. He was never the best at scrying. Among the old guard of the Gatewatch, mind-reading was Jace's purview. Opening the realm of inner selves as one does an encyclopedia—it made Teferi uncomfortable to plunge into that private place, to risk plucking the wrong strand and unraveling the puzzle box that was the human mind. Moreover, he found it wrong, an invasion—but there was a need, he was desperate, and time was against them all.</p>

<p>A slight ringing in his ear. The acrid stink of burning grass. A single scream, cut short by a leaf-blade spear.</p>

<p>"Ten," Teferi said, the memory fading.</p>

<p>"Ten dead?" Eshe shook her head. "A tragedy. But don't worry," she said. "We will take good care of you."</p>

<hr />

<p>The caravan halted that next morning, a day out from Kiingal.</p>

<p>"Line up, line up," the guards called, urging the caravanners to form ranks at the side of the road. "Hurry, there might be bandits," they cried, admonishing the bleary-eyed traders.</p>

<p>Teferi lined up with the caravanners, swaying a little as he tried to stand at the attention the guards demanded. It had been a fitful night of sleep, even after his nightmares passed. He yawned, responding to the caravanner at his side, who trembled with the strength of her own yawn.</p>

<p>"This a normal morning?" Teferi asked the caravanner.</p>

<p>"No," she said. She shook, not from the cold, as it was a warm morning, but fear. "Do not trust these bandits," she said, whispering, speaking quickly. "They killed our guards and took their place, they plan to sell our goods to—"</p>

<p>"Quiet," Eshe hissed. The caravanner started, surprised. Eshe looked between the two of them.</p>

<p>Teferi met Eshe's stare, and in that moment understood. She looked at him with pure hatred, with recognition. She knew who he was.</p>

<p>"Back in line Sefu," Eshe said to Teferi. "Not another move."</p>

<p>Teferi nodded and stood in line. What happened next was not yet written; there could be a way out of this that was not just a collision. He stayed silent and waited.</p>

<p>The guards stood across from the caravanners, outnumbered but armed and armored, waiting for Eshe to finish her slow review of their prisoners. She walked with stiff precision.</p>

<p>"Listen to me," Eshe said, as she reached the end of the line. Her voice carried over the lonely stretch of road, rising above the morning's drone of insects, clear and bright. "You have been patient with us. Kind to us despite how we have treated you. Now, I am asking for one more act of charity: among you, there is a snake."</p>

<p>The caravanners risked worried glances between each other.</p>

<p>"Zhalfir is at war," Eshe continued. She turned and started, slowly, pacing back down the line of assembled caravanners. "We have been at war for generations. First, it was the Mirage War, then the Keldon War, and now this long wait. Preparation for the Phyrexian War, the defense of Dominaria against Yawgmoth's hordes. Our fields, our cities, our lands, our people—bent to war, for generations." Eshe stopped next to one of the caravanners. Without looking, she pointed at them. "You," she said. "How many of your family have you lost?"</p>

<p>"Three during the Mirage War," the caravanner said, stammering to croak the words from her fear-dried throat. "My mother, my grandmother, and my grandfather."</p>

<p>"And you?" Eshe pointed to the next caravanner.</p>

<p>"Two, when the Keldons attacked," they said. "My husband and my brother."</p>

<p>"You?"</p>

<p>"My brother, my sister, and both of my daughters to Kaervek's armies in the Mirage War. And I was wounded at Tefemburu."</p>

</div>

<p>Eshe nodded. She reached out to this last caravanner, overcome for a moment. Resting her forehead against his, she whispered something quiet and private to him. Then, she kissed his forehead and stepped away. She looked to her bandit comrades, pointed to them, and then back to the caravanners.</p>

<p>"Every one of us here is linked in grief," Eshe said. "We are brothers and sisters and siblings in loss, hunger, and fear."</p>

<p>Teferi looked down at the red earth beneath his bare feet. No tears. They were not his to cry.</p>

<p>"Zhalfir alone, us alone, stopped every blade aimed at us." Eshe's voice shook with emotion. "No matter how many dead, no matter how fearsome the enemy."</p>

<p>Silence. Eshe tapped the base of her spear against the packed dirt of the road, a rhythm meant to calm, meant to steady unquiet hearts. She walked the few more steps necessary to bring her to Teferi.</p>

<p>"Alone," Eshe said. All other sound seemed to have fled the warm morning. "One of us here did not suffer that pain. He slipped away. But he has returned," she said. Eshe raised an arm, pointing at Teferi. "Here is Teferi, the snake."</p>

<p>The caravanners and guards both broke out into a commotion, shouting and gasping at the revelation. All order was forgotten as caravanners stepped away from Teferi and guards stepped toward, drawing their weapons. Some of the caravanners stalked toward him as well, balling their fists. Teferi did not resist as they grabbed him, he simply held his hands up.</p>

<p>"Eshe, please."</p>

<p>"No," Eshe said. She lifted her spear, coiled her strength, and thrust for his heart.</p>

<p>"Stop," Teferi said, and time obliged.</p>

<p>He sighed. Carefully, he untangled himself from the time-locked caravanners who restrained him, then crouched down, exhausted. He sat.</p>

<p>"I didn't sleep well last night," Teferi muttered. "Eshe, can you hear me?" He asked. He looked up at Eshe, who was not quite frozen, but moving almost imperceptibly slow, still trapped in her thrust. She did not acknowledge him. A low moan rumbled from her throat—her killing cry, slowed.</p>

<p>"Right." Teferi gestured, waving a finger in a lazy arc. Eshe's stab sped up, and Teferi could hear her cry pitching toward normal. Confusion started to bloom across her face as her eyes finally told her mind that Teferi had vanished.</p>

<p>"Down here," he said.</p>

<p>Eshe heard him minutes later. Confusion was turning to anger, but now she was looking at him. Teferi watched her struggle against slowed time, trying to turn the guard on her spear, trying to bring its blade down in an ugly but functional chop.</p>

<p>"I loved a caravanner once," Teferi said. "Her name was Subira. She, like you, thought I was a murderer when she met me. An idiot. She thought many things about me. But she gave me charity. She listened to me," Teferi said. He looked up, not to Eshe but to the sky, blinking back tears. "She listened when I did not deserve to be listened to. We loved each other, and we made a family together." He wiped the tears away. "She didn't lose anyone when I sent Zhalfir away. She grew up on the road, as her family had for generations—Zhalfir was only a story to her. " He winced. What he would say next hurt, but he needed to hear himself say it.</p>

<p>"I think," Teferi said, the words thick and cold in his mouth, "that I let her love absolve me of the great pain I caused you. The pain I caused Zhalfir, our home. Subira accepted me, which took a great deal of grace. But her accepting me, loving me—" Teferi shook his head. "Love like that saves a soul, but it doesn't heal this." Teferi plunged his fingers into the red earth, pulled two handfuls up, and let it spill between his fingers. The color painted his palms, dug under his nails. It would never leave. "She passed before I could find a way to fix this."</p>

<p>Eshe's spear finally turned, edge on. It was a foot or more away, and Teferi could stop it without so much as a gesture; he was in no danger, but still Eshe fought. He wiped his palms on his donated robe, then reached up and grabbed the spear's blade.</p>

<p>"I cannot be forgiven," Teferi said. "I can only do what is right." He squeezed the blade, letting it cut his palm. His blood, bright red, ran down his arm, fell from his elbow, and mingled with the dirt. Zhalfir in him, and he in Zhalfir, and the pain the cost. "I loved her as I loved this land," he said. "And I will see Zhalfir safe through what comes next. This is my promise. That is how I fix this."</p>

<p>Could Eshe hear the pain in his voice? Trapped in that moment trying to kill the Destroyer of Zhalfir, a desperate man from the future telling her that her war would not end here. The echo of his own recent experience with Urza was not lost on him; he wondered if those dark shapes outside of the little lake they had swum in were looking in now. If they were turning their vast and unfathomable minds to this moment. If they were going to break in here, too, and send him somewhere else.</p>

<p>Later, Teferi thought. Phyrexia, again, first.</p>

<p>"Eshe, I am going to stop this spell," Teferi said. "But I need you to promise you will let me go." Being known to Zhalfir was unavoidable now. All Teferi could do was buy himself time before greater authorities came searching for him; this party may have been composed of bandits and their prisoners, but bringing news of his arrival would likely cause a storm that would erase their transgressions—or cause enough turmoil that they could escape in the clamor.</p>

<p>Eshe's moan continued. Teferi released the spear and stood, checking his cut palm. He stepped a few paces back from where he had been standing, away from the caravanners that had restrained him and well outside of the range of Eshe's spear. He raised his hands, summoning up a fearsome blue light, a raw channel of mana that rankled the nose and set even the hairs on the back of his neck on end—this was the bared fang, the crackling core of a fire, something deep and primal not tied to any art but raw, searing power. A demonstration, just in case.</p>

<p>Teferi let time resume its normal course.</p>

<p>Eshe finished her cry, turning from anger to anguish. She stumbled backward, lifting her spearpoint from him. Teferi shook the bluing power from his hands, sending it back into the land.</p>

<p>"Eshe, thank you."</p>

<p>"Go away," Eshe said. Sweat slicked her dark skin, and she heaved from the effort of fighting against his magic. She worked to catch her breath, and her arms trembled.</p>

<p>Teferi raised his hands, palms open to her. Eshe did not flinch, but many of the caravanners and guards scurried away, taking cover behind the wagons.</p>

<p>"There is nothing more you can say to us," Eshe said. "Just go away."</p>

<p>Teferi nodded. He stood, slowly, and started backing away. Eshe did not look at him. She stared at the ground where he had sat, at the disturbed earth where he had pulled handfuls of soil.</p>

<p>Teferi went away, hurrying down the road, alone. After a long while, Eshe and her caravan departed in the opposite direction, together.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Elsewhere</strong></p>

<p>Teferi slept and dreamed.</p>

<p>There is a great chain of happening, first forged in fires long distant and dead. All things are linked to this chain and travel along it, but they travel backward, only able to see the chain that was and not how it will be. Teferi recalled he tried to explain this to Urza in their moment away, but articulating reality was difficult. Maybe he could have summed it all up better before he gave up his spark for the first time.</p>

<p>Most beings in this great heaving mass of sentient creatures across time and the Multiverse never have the luxury of revelation or witness, much less the chance to grab history itself and bend it to their will; Teferi had given up his spark and then restored it—the power he held might as well be godlike. Time was his, alone.</p>

<p>Anyway, this chain was made by many hands, and a rare few find themselves at the right moment of history to stamp their mark. The further back one goes down the chain, the more faded these marks become. The inverse, then, is true: the closer to the raw edge of the chain, the clearer the maker's mark is. The signatures of those who have forged a link, spliced a connection, or forced a diversion, all glow, cooling as if set in iron.</p>

<p>Teferi, dreaming, looked down at the chain rattling through his core. No pain at all, just an infinite line, stretching down, down, down into the darkness of the past, each link stamped with his name.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Zhalfir, Months Later</strong></p>

<p>The river water was cool and clear, carrying a welcome chill down from the Little Teremko Mountains. Even as the light dimmed, the vast plane clung to the day's heat.</p>

<p>Teferi worked, stripped to the waist, wading through the river at the middle point of a long line of other laborers, trousers rolled up above their knees, hauling together a finely meshed net across the breadth of the river's long and shallow inner bend. Beyond the last fisher, the riverbed dipped, plunging deep as it reached the opposite bank where the current carved steadily away at the sandy loam. This was their final net, the last of the day.</p>

<p>Minutes and hours mingled together. All moments were one: the gurgling water around his legs was the distant rumble of the mighty river. The gentle current was the coarse rope in his hands. Hauled in tempo with the simple song the others sang, then added his voice. The song from his lips was the air from the lungs of his comrades who also pulled the coarse rope, who kept their backs to the gentle current, who, too, heard the distant rumbling river and its soft gurgling.</p>

<p>Labor, shared, time, shared. Beauty at the river, this simple work, this laboring of many arms pulling, many throats singing, many hands on this net crafted by deft-fingered artisans years before, hauling to catch fat silver fish from the cold clear river. Hope in the hands that pulled the fibers, the deft fingers that stitched, the sun-dark arms that pulled hope across time. One net that wrapped hundreds of lives in one unbroken length of time and labor to produce, at the end of it all, life.</p>

<p>"Shaper," the laborer to his side called out to him. All up and down the line, under the song, little conversations carried on. Like the river, the song contained eddies and whorls. "When the war comes, will you march with the warclans, or will you stay here in the village?"</p>

<p>"I would stay," Teferi said. He grunted and worked with his section to haul in the net, hand over hand. "But I serve at the pleasure of the queen. Where she says, I go."</p>

<p>"You live like these fish," the laborer said. "I will join the akinji along with my sisters when the war comes."</p>

<p>Teferi looked over to her. She was young and wore painted shoulders for strength. What she learned in this labor would guide her spear, draw her bow.</p>

<p>"How many sisters do you have?"</p>

<p>"Three," the laborer said. "Neema, Kani, and Amana."</p>

<p>"And your name?"</p>

<p>"Oyana. And I know who you are," Oyana said. "You are quiet, but you do not have to speak to be known. You should speak more."</p>

<p>Teferi smiled. It was kind of her to suggest he speak more, but he felt he had spoken enough. Keeping quiet was prudent and penitent.</p>

<p>"The others said you came to our village to hide," Oyana said. "Kani told me that that you were spit on and cursed when you went to the city. I cannot imagine the beautiful people there doing that, but Kani also says the beautiful people of the city speak with their mouths closed."</p>

<p>Teferi grunted. He never noticed that.</p>

<p>"My sister Neema was already in General Mageta's service when the queen called for them to prepare. Kani, Amana, and I would have had to remain here, doing this," she hauled her section of net. "Now all of us are old enough to fight, and this work has made me strong." Oyana stood and flexed. "When we return, I'll be at the front, and I'll show all of Dominaria who we are and who they are."</p>

<p>Teferi bent to pull the next length, working to reel the net in.</p>

<p>"Zhalfir is ready," Oyana said. Now she spoke with a firm voice, drawing the attention of the other laborers around them. "I am ready. My sisters and brothers are ready. The Phyrexians cannot stand against us."</p>

<p>The other laborers muttered their agreement, rumbling, rising with the sound of the river.</p>

<p>"So you have nothing to be quiet about," Oyana said to the Shaper. "You are the father of Zhalfir. Our creeds were shaped by you. Our land was moved by you. Speak with your mouth open, Teferi."</p>

<p>Teferi grabbed up the next length of netting and said nothing. He worked, conscious of Oyana's eyes on him, of the eyes of all the laborers on him, of the setting sun and the water about his legs turning from cool to cold. He could feel the anger simmering through some of the laborers' gazes, but more were curious, staring at him the way one would stare at a rare, majestic, dangerous creature.</p>

<p>"What was that?" Oyana asked. Though the other laborers had gone back to their diligent work, Oyana had not. She had watched Teferi, waiting for him to respond. He wasn't sure if her question was because she had heard him, or if his voice—so long quiet—had been lost under the river.</p>

<p>"No one is ready," Teferi repeated himself. "No one can stop them. Not even the brave."</p>

<p>Oyana stepped back. She frowned, looked Teferi up and down, and shook her head. She moved away.</p>

<p>Teferi returned to his work.</p>

<p>Downstream, where the catch danced and leaped, the river bent, taking with it the tall grasses and broad trees, the land and the horizon. Distant mountains caught the setting sun's light, ridges flaring bright in defiance of the end of the day, folds already dark as the approaching night. The clouds above streaked the sky in rich, warm tones of summer. High summer, no ceiling above the plane. And beyond the sky, a blankness. A blindness, empyrean, that hid them all from the terrors beyond.</p>

<p>Looking up, Teferi could only just see that void behind the sky, as if it were bare stone visible under a thin layer of paint—the work of obscuring it not yet complete. He smiled. Teferi was home.</p>

<hr />

<p>Teferi and the fishers returned to the village at twilight, the long net rolled and carried on their shoulders like the corpse of a great snake. They carried their catch with them and torches to light the way. There was little conversation—at nightfall, the day's labors caught up to them, and all minds were on food, a return to their families, and rest.</p>

<p>The village blended into the earth, an orderly arrangement of clay-brick homes and long, low community buildings with living roofs. Granaries, kilns, smokehouses, cold forges, tanneries, public stables—this was a hub for the farmers, fishers, hunters, and foragers that lived in the region, and was itself a satellite of the city a dozen miles to the west. A small, squat, domed temple was the only building that stood out from the rest: the creedhall. Unlike the other buildings and homes that blended into the grassland, the creedhall wanted to be seen. It occupied a central location in the village, a humble temple to the five creeds of magic, a faith and philosophy that guided Zhalfir, and a place for members of any creed to rest while crossing Zhalfir.</p>

</figure>
</div>

<p>Teferi ducked into the building, taking a moment to wash his feet in the tiled trough at the creedhall's entrance. A simple screen separated the inner domed space from the entryway, a baffle to dim any light and muffle any sound that might filter in from outside. Teferi breathed in the rich, faintly sweet incense that drifted out. Zhalfirin wellwood, smoldering in the mana well at the creedhall's center. He closed his eyes. A moment of reverence, of an ache mollified, of chambers of his lungs and his heart filling once more after being empty so long that he forgot they could be filled. He dried his feet. Stepped around the entry screen and into the main chamber.</p>

<p>The room under the dome was a pentagon, each face representing one of the five colors of magic. Opposite the entry was a dark wall with a simple door set into it; beyond were humble quarters kept ready for members of the creeds. A low bench ringed in the room, set back from the central feature: a shallow, broad, stone bowl that held a modest bed of smoldering wellwood coals. That dim heat was the only light in this space which, under the dome, felt vast, far larger than the exterior of the mana well suggested.</p>

<p>Teferi moved quietly and slowly, walking to his station just left of the entryway. There he paused before the arc of the Shaper Creed, knelt to grab the edge of the bowl, and pressed his forehead to it. The hum of mana resonated through him, a warm and familiar feeling that thrummed up through this well and collected into the wide stone basin. Somewhere below him, around him, through him, was a leyline.</p>

<p>"Kaya," Teferi whispered. "Can you hear me?"</p>

<p>Nothing. The coals sputtered; a wellwood log crumbling.</p>

<p>"My name is Teferi Akosa. I keep watch for the lost and forgotten. I am the father of Niambi and husband of Subira. I—" Teferi stopped his recitation. A shuffling, from the opposite side of the chamber. He looked over the lip of the bowl to see a young acolyte carefully closing the door behind her. She wore plain white robes, marking her as an inductee of the Civic Creed; an aspiring healer, she had stuck close to Teferi as soon as he had arrived in the village, not to learn but to make sure he did not fall into ruin.</p>

<p>"Adia," Teferi said, greeting the acolyte.</p>

<p>"Shaper," Adia murmured. To speak any louder in the creedhall would sound like shouting. "You're back. A good day?"</p>

<p>"A good day," Teferi said, standing. "We caught plenty for our quota—the grangers might protest, but we'll be able to make the queen's order and have weight remaining for trade."</p>

<p>Adia nodded. "Soldiers from Kipamu came looking for you."</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"Shortly after you left for the river. They thought to find you here."</p>

<p>"Did they say what for?"</p>

<p>"The war," Adia said. She spread her hands, palms up. Nothing more to be said. The queen ordered all Zhalfir to be mobilized, the five high wizards and General Mageta concurred, and so Zhalfir would be mobilized. A perfect organ, a state logical and sober, a people motivated to prove themselves, and a plane to be saved. Neat, clean, a myth waiting to be written, with monumental plazas of empty plinths waiting for statues of its heroes, bare walls waiting for mosaics of its great battles.</p>

<p>That alley, that city, that boy whimpering, all that blood, those bodies, the fire above it all, the engine of living steel.</p>

<p>"I told them you had gone to the river," Adia said. "And that you would return this evening."</p>

<p>"Dutiful," Teferi grimaced.</p>

<p>Adia inclined her head, a small gesture in place of a grand bow.</p>

<p>"I'll need to wash first, and eat," Teferi walked past the acolyte, heading for his small room. "Go and find the soldiers, tell them I will be here. That's all. Thank you," he said, waving Adia away. He didn't wait to see if the young acolyte departed; he needed food and fresh clothing, a moment to rest. When Adia brought the soldiers back, none of those things would be guaranteed.</p>

<hr />

<p>Soldiers had been a dramatic understatement. Teferi had expected a handful of akinji following some middle-seniority askari like ducklings trailing behind their mother; the party that greeted him when he stepped out into the creedhall's main chamber was closer to a war council. A dozen muscled sidars in rich blue robes and finely tanned armor waited for him, tall warriors who wore their swords ready to draw, rich furs across their shoulders and steel in their eyes. The sidars surrounded their leader, an officer in shining silver armor who clutched a red-winged helm under his arm.</p>

<p>"Teferi Planeswalker," the general roared, spreading his arms wide. "You bastard, I found you!"</p>

<p>"I am just Teferi <em>Akosa</em> now, Jabari," Teferi said. He allowed himself a small smile, relieved for the moment. If the queen had sent his executioner, at least he was a friend. "It has been so long."</p>

<p>"Has it?" Jabari asked as they embraced. He slapped Teferi's back, squeezing him, then pulled back, cupping the back of Teferi's head. "Maybe for you," he said, pointing, "but for me, no. A few more gray hairs, but not so many as you." Jabari laughed again and let him go. "You're back, but where is the rest of the plane? Our sailors still say there is nothing beyond the shore, and our rangers who climb into the mist do not return."</p>

<p>"Zhalfir is still on her own," Teferi said. "I'm sorry."</p>

<p>"Don't do that now. No more apologizing," Jabari said. "I've heard stories of your penitent pilgrimage, it sounds exhausting." He waved for his retinue to part and led Teferi out from the creedhall. "The great mendicant, always a step ahead of us. Pick yourself up. You are the archmage of Zhalfir, and Zhalfir needs you."</p>

<p>"Queen Wezna will kill me."</p>

<p>"Well, yes," Jabari nodded. "But after you help Zhalfir, first."</p>

<p>"I don't know if I can," Teferi said. "I'm not sure I can even help myself."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I don't know how I got here. I shouldn't have been able to. Zhalfir is<nbsp> . . .</nbsp>" Teferi waved a hand, searching for the words. "Lost. Alone. As you said: there's nothing beyond the shore."</p>

<p>Jabari considered this, arms crossed, chin dipping to his chest. He frowned, walked a few steps away, stopped, and beckoned for Teferi to follow.</p>

<p>Teferi and Jabari walked together away from the general's askari and the creedhall. The village was alive around them, full of the sound of song, laughter, and happy noise. The catch had been rich, just as Teferi thought—enough for the village's tithe to the war effort, and plenty to celebrate.</p>

<p>"You need to know this," Jabari said, speaking quietly. "My askari only know that we are to recruit new soldiers and to retrieve you for the queen, but they do not know why."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"You are not the only one from outside to come here."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Zhalfir is not so alone," Jabari said. "Old friend, this is how you will help us; you will come with me to Aku to see this other wanderer like you."</p>

<p>"Aku." Old memories came back to him: the pillar fields and the tombs, the ancient city of Aku, listing above the steaming quagmire that was the vast swamp of Uuserk. "Not Kaervek?"</p>

<p>"No." Jabari said. "This one is a woman of regal bearing. We have her secured in amber as well, but before we did," Jabari reached out to Teferi again, tapping him on the chest to emphasize each word. "She asked for you."</p>

<p><em>A woman of regal bearing.</em> He knew too many. Could Kaya and Saheeli have devised some way to cross the void and reach Zhalfir? How long had it been outside of this space? Time inside this place passed differently than time outside of it, he knew that well enough by now. Perhaps they had rebuilt the anchor, maybe they had found Karn, or sent this other Planeswalker as he had been sent, but in a way that they could reel them both back.</p>

<p>"Describe her to me."</p>

<p>"Young, but with white hair," Jabari said. "A thin sword, fine golden armor. The loremasters tell me that she looks Madaran. Also, this—" He looked past Teferi and whistled to one of his soldiers, gesturing for him to come over to them. The soldier, who had been carrying a cloth-wrapped object, hustled over. He bowed and offered the cloth to Teferi and Jabari.</p>

<p>Teferi took the bundle. He unwrapped it, revealing an exquisite, wide-brimmed hat. It was armored in glossy, lacquered gold and green—light, but sturdy, balancing defense and ornament.</p>

<p>"A strange hat, but good for travel," Jabari said.</p>

<p>"Good for wandering," Teferi muttered. He recognized the woman's description. Not just any wanderer: the Wanderer. Another Planeswalker, here on Zhalfir. Not Kaya or Saheeli, but another who knew to look for him.</p>

<p>"How soon will we leave?" Teferi asked.</p>

<p>"Tomorrow," Jabari said. "We will have to hurry: the queen is already there, and she awaits the arrival of her archmage."</p>

<p>"Tomorrow," Teferi repeated. Tomorrow they would set off to Aku, to meet the Wanderer and see what message she brought. What was this feeling? Hope, Teferi realized. Hope for a moment, followed by the cold whisper of truth: this was a happy revelation, but not a good one. Zhalfir connected to the Multiverse once more meant Zhalfir would be in danger.</p>

<hr />

<p>The next morning, Jabari's sidars were up before the dawn, attending to their supply carts and personal packs. Later, as the sun began to burn away the morning's steamy haze, a brace of new recruits—youths finally of age to join the warbands—joined them. Teferi arrived with this group, along with the rest of the village. The fishers had already made for the river well before dawn, leaving only a quiet population of elders and dry land artisans to see them off.</p>

<p>The journey would be long, crossing the Mtenda Plains to the rocky plateaus that bordered Zhalfir's north. In his youth, Teferi knew of roads that wound up into the mighty spines of the Teremko mountains, but he supposed the road they followed diverted west along the coast, crossing the shores of Buleusi Bay before wheeling back south. At the end of that road was Aku, the tomb city, tucked away in the remote Uuserk Marshes far from the light of Kipamu.</p>

<p>"Shaper?"</p>

<p>Teferi looked up from the ground to see Adia, the acolyte of the mana well, approaching him with a bundle of cloth.</p>

<p>"I thought you should have these," Adia said. She held the bundle out to Teferi, a soft frown on her face.</p>

<p>"What is this?" Teferi asked, accepting the soft bundle. He unrolled it, holding the robes up before him.</p>

<p>"The old Shaper's robes, before you." Adia said. "They are clean. I mended the moth and mouse holes. They're appropriate for your rank. An older style, but"—she shrugged—"so are you."</p>

<p>Teferi smiled. "Thank you, Adia."</p>

<p>"I live to serve the creed," she said, her voice even. She bowed, stood, placed her hands in front of her, still didn't look at Teferi.</p>

<p>"I have a daughter, Adia," Teferi said, kindly, as he rolled the up the robes. "She was your age once, too."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"You seem like you have more to say."</p>

<p>Adia nodded.</p>

<p>Teferi finished securing the robes in his pack, letting Adia take the time she needed.</p>

<p>"If Zhalfir is to return, that means the war is going to start," Adia said. "Really start. No more waiting or training. 'Zhalfir Alone' will end, and we'll be back in the real world."</p>

<p>"That is true," Teferi said.</p>

<p>Adia looked to the side, checking that no one else could hear. All others were engaged in small conversations—elders seeing off their adult grandchildren, eager recruits showing off to Jabari's askari, Jabari talking with his attendants. They had privacy in the middle of all of that.</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure that Zhalfir returning to the world is a good thing if return means the war begins—actually begins," Adia said, speaking quickly and in one breath, as if spitting out a foul lozenge she had been forced to carry in her mouth. "This limbo is bad, but it is still peaceful; the Mirage and Keldon Wars took someone from every family, and those were wars against people, like you and me." She looked up to Teferi. "I am an orphan because of the Keldon War. I serve the Civic Creed because of what that war took from me. I think our people only imagine war against Phyrexia as a test. A great examination, where they can prove their might and show Dominaria where the sun rises. I think that we've all lost so much that we can't imagine losing anything else; we forget what war takes, even when there's nothing left."</p>

<p>Teferi reached out and gently maneuvered Adia to the side, a little farther from the group. The recruits were saying their last goodbyes, and the sidars were starting to file into line.</p>

<p>"I'm terrified of the cost of this war," Adia continued to whisper. "I'm sick with worry—to lose means ruin, but what happens when we win?" She gestured back at the sidars and recruits. "Zhalfir has spent so long waiting and sharpening her swords that when we defeat Phyrexia, we'll discover that war is the only thing we know how to do."</p>

<p>Teferi said nothing.</p>

<p>"What do we do?" Adia asked. "What do I do?"</p>

<p>"Teferi!" Jabari called from the head of the forming column, waving him over. "Don't try to sneak off again, Planeswalker, or I'll use you to train my scouts!"</p>

<p>Teferi waved, and then pulled on his pack. Adia hadn't moved. The acolyte waited for an answer Teferi did not yet have. Instead, all he could think of was his own daughter, Niambi.</p>

<p>Once, when Niambi was quite young, they had been playing in their courtyard while Subira was away. Laughing, free, and without fear, Niambi had taken off running. She tripped before Teferi could warn her, and before Teferi knew it, he had frozen her in time, arresting her mid-fall.</p>

<p>He remembered walking around her, trying to gauge every possible outcome of releasing her from what he could glean of that one moment, frozen in time. He could have kept her there forever if he wanted—and part of him wanted that, to keep her there, safe, away from the world—but he had shaken away that dark thought. His decision was to find a middle between fall and salvation: to catch her.</p>

<p>He could not catch them now, but he could be there with them all.</p>

<p>"Some things are so big," Teferi said, "that there's nothing you or I can do to stop them."</p>

<p>"Not you," Adia said. "Not bigger than you. You sent us away to protect us, so keep us away. Protect us, protect Zhalfir."</p>

<p>"I can't." Teferi shook his head.</p>

<p>"But you did!"</p>

<p>"I was a different person back then," Teferi said. "I was<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> more. Less. I was someone else." He looked to the road. All the way to Aku and beyond. "Listen, Adia, I have not been here for many years, but in my brief time back—Zhalfir is not just war. We do not just fight. We were something else before all of this," Teferi said. "We can't stop what is coming, but we can control what happens after." Teferi gestured to the soldiers, the recruits, the land. "There is a great terror approaching, yes, but it will only remain as long as we choose to hold on to it."</p>

<p>"I don't understand."</p>

<p>"We are not bound by fate," Teferi said. "Only our past. We were not always soldiers. We were not always alone."</p>

<p>Adia lifted a finger to respond, then stopped. She composed herself. "May you reach your destination," she said. Adia did not wait for Teferi to reply, but left, walking quickly back to the village. Teferi did not try to stop her, only watched as she pushed through the ranks of eager recruits. Her robes, white as clouds, disappeared into the crowd.</p>

<p>What had he thought, back when Niambi fell? <em>No amount of soul-searching could bring back Zhalfir. </em>Well, some amount of soul-searching brought him back, only to find that no amount of apologizing could fix what he had done. It was never going to be as easy as bringing Zhalfir back; Zhalfir was not just a name on a map. It was a nation, a people, a history, a future, and nothing he could control. Nothing he could save on his own, no matter how much he wanted to. Wasn't that the mark of a good parent? Knowing when there was nothing that they could do but be there for their child when they needed them the most? He had wronged them all, but he could stand with them now; he could teach them how to brace against the fall and help them stand after.</p>

<p>"Teferi!"</p>

<p>"Jabari," Teferi shouted back. He waited a heartbeat. Reached his fingers to his lips, kissed them, touched them to his forehead, and placed his hand over his heart. An old gesture. Gratitude to this place for what it gave him, for what it taught him.</p>

<p>Teferi left with the soldiers and recruits, marching alongside them up the long road to Aku.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Aku, Weeks Later</strong></p>

<p>The journey to Aku was not long, but it was fraught with danger, but Jabari and his soldiers—with Teferi's help—had seen the road to its end without loss. Upon reaching the city, without even time to bathe or eat, runners came to collect Teferi and Jabari.</p>

<p>The halls of Aku were warm and solemn. The queen's presence demanded tapestries be hung and rich rugs rolled out over the glossy floors, for braziers to be loaded with smoldering wellwood and other finely scented fuels; Aku might have been a tomb city, but it was not a scorned place. These decorations were for the living and the dead both: Zhalfir's royal lines rested here, and the queen had come to them to seek inspiration, comfort, and spiritual guidance—solemnity was a sign of respect, not fear. Peace, to better channel the wisdom of a people.</p>

<p>However, this sense of peace did not extend throughout the entire city. The Amber Tombs, where the past's dark secrets were held under guard by the strongest magics, the most ancient and powerful wisdoms Zhalfir's ancestors could impart, bristled with unsettling energy. Extra torches and glowstones were ordered in to banish the persistent shadows that lingered throughout the corridors; this was especially the case inside of the Amber Tombs's main dome, where one could keep watch on the most dangerous threats to Zhalfir.</p>

<p>Teferi and Jabari followed the runners through the winding corridors of Aku's central district to the Amber Tombs, where the queen waited for them. Every turn of the narrow, high halls of Aku's streets was patrolled by a pair of queen's guard, often accompanied by a Shaper Creed or, worryingly, Civic Creed clerics wearing armor.</p>

<p>"Not a normal deployment, right?" Teferi whispered to Jabari as the two of them walked past a saluting pair of clerics.</p>

<p>"Not at all," Jabari muttered. "Something must have happened in the tombs."</p>

<p>"Maybe the queen will stay my execution," Teferi said. "I'm joking, not pleading," he added. "To be clear."</p>

<p>Jabari grunted, not smiling, and picked up the pace.</p>

<p>Teferi and Jabari reached the Amber Tombs to find its entrance crowded with soldiers and clerics, weapons drawn, some facing toward them, others facing inside. Two officers, askari of some high seniority, argued with each other in whispers, their voices harsh and unintelligible in the echoing hallway.</p>

<p>"Askari," Jabari said, firm, loud but not shouting. His voice cut through the noise. "What's happening? Is the queen in danger?"</p>

<p>The sidars stopped arguing, both turning to Jabari in unison.</p>

<p>"Kaervek has escaped," one of the askari said. She was composed, but nerves thinned her already severe face. "His prison shattered. The general is wounded, but stable."</p>

<p>"When?" Teferi asked.</p>

<p>"An hour at most," the askari said, wiping sweat from her brow.</p>

<p>"General Mageta was wounded <em>an hour ago</em>?" Jabari asked, shocked, his voice rising.</p>

<p>"We only just discovered him," the askari said, raising a hand to try and calm Jabari. "He was wounded by Kaervek's prison shattering, but will survive—it is bad, but not fatal."</p>

<p>"Let us through," Teferi ordered. Little time for words.</p>

<p>The guards parted. Teferi led Jabari through into the central chamber of the Amber Tomb, a single, vast, dark dome. Sconces sunk into the wall at regular, regimented intervals, dim lights glowing deep within them. All were empty, but it was easy enough to discern what they once held: amber prisons.</p>

<p>The chamber was ancient, and legends whispered of dark origins, magics and rituals Zhalfir's ancestors risked employing to ensure those who needed to stay locked away did, suspending a warding pendulum from the dome's apex to serve as a warning system. The scholars of Zhalfir waved these histories away as myth and wishful fantasy—but few ever visited the central dome of the tombs, and all of those that did could not deny a certain unnerving quality to the room. A silence blanketed the chamber that, being a dome, should echo like a concert hall. A deep, sure feeling that, should that dully burnished pendulum twitch, ruin would follow.</p>

<p>With horror, Teferi saw that the pendulum had snapped and fallen to the polished floor of the dome. Its point was embedded in the ground, its large chain coiled around it like the corpse of a great snake. The floor, polished to a mirror shine, had shattered. Dark liquid—General Mageta's blood, Teferi guessed—pooled near the pendulum, resisting the efforts of a handful of soldiers who tried to swab it up.</p>

<p>Queen Wezna stood off to the side, conversing with two robed figures, one in sky blue and the other in a velvet black. A third, armored in white, stood off to the side, idly examining the fallen pendulum and the shattered ground. Teferi did not recognize any of the robed figures—the leaders of their respective creed, he was sure—but the queen was unmistakable, aged only a decade since last he saw her centuries prior.</p>

<p>"Your grace," Jabari called, bowing quickly as she turned. "I beg your understanding; we have only just arrived—"</p>

<p>"Three hundred and sixty years," Queen Wezna said, striding toward Teferi. She did not shout—she declared, and the dome resounded with her voice. "Three hundred and sixty years gone, and it is still us against them," The queen said. "Phyrexia looms at our borders, Kaervek has escaped, and General Mageta wounded." She stopped a few paces away, trailed by the three creed leaders. "And you, returned to us. There is no punishment great enough to justly weigh the acts you have committed—tell me why I should not order my sentence for you carried out right at this moment."</p>

<p>"If you kill me," Teferi said, "they will win."</p>

<p>The queen inhaled, exhaled. Nodded.</p>

<p>"Sidar Jabari," Queen Wezna said, speaking to the old officer without breaking eye contact with Teferi. "The Civics have a hospital in the pillar district; the general convalesces there. Go and see him. You will lead the army until he recovers."</p>

<p>"Yes, your grace," Jabari said. Teferi heard him walk away, the sound of his boots hurried on the polished stone.</p>

<p>Queen Wezna turned and walked back to the fallen pendulum, hands crossed behind her back, thinking. She stopped before her three creed mages, back turned to Teferi.</p>

<p>"You were not summoned by me," Queen Wezna said, speaking to Teferi. "I cannot have you brought to justice for your crimes—great or small—yet, but I have my pride." She turned back around to face him. "I did not summon you here."</p>

<p>"Where is she?" Teferi asked.</p>

<p>The queen reached into her robes, pulled out a small, palm-size amber bauble, and tossed it toward him. The amber prison bounced, skipping off the polished stone floor, and slid to a stop at Teferi's feet.</p>

<p>Teferi bent to pick up the prison, pinching it between his pointer finger and thumb. He lifted it up to the light, illuminating the figure within. Small, frozen in time, likely moments after planeswalking, a warrior mid-strike. Squinting, Teferi could see on her face a look of determination slipping to confusion—a hard brow softening, her mouth opening to ask a question, her eyes wide with surprise.</p>

<p>The Wanderer.</p>

<p>"When you are done looking, set it down on the ground." The queen said.</p>

<p>Teferi obliged. He set the prison gently on the ground, and then stepped back.</p>

<p>Queen Wezna snapped her fingers, and the white-armored creed leader stepped forward. He whispered a quiet spell, subtle and without theater. The prison began to glow.</p>

<p>"Another step back, archmage," he said, looking over the rising light at Teferi.</p>

<p>Teferi obliged, stepping back as the prison began to spit and spark. He shielded his eyes, turning as the prison snapped, bursting open with a sharp report followed moments later by a short, sharp exhalation as the Wanderer finished her swing, crying out in surprise.</p>

<p>The Wanderer recovered, resetting her stance and guard, breathing hard, her composure rattled but not broken.</p>

<p>"Wanderer," Teferi shouted, hands up and palms out. "It's me."</p>

<p>"Teferi?" She shouted, overloud. The Wanderer quickly took in her surroundings, guard high. "Where am I? How long has it been?"</p>

<p>"Aku," Queen Wezna said. "On Zhalfir. It has been a month since you arrived."</p>

<p>"A month?" The Wanderer repeated. She lowered her sword, eyes searching the space between them for something only she could see. "That's impossible—Teferi, you only disappeared days ago!"</p>

<p>"The anchor failed," Teferi mused. How? Serra's powerstone—the potential of a plane, shunted through him—something to do with the sylex. That space that he and Urza went to after it detonated—all that potential had to go somewhere, had to find something to cling to. Chance, fate, or some combination of the two.</p>

<p>"We might not even have the day," The Wanderer whispered. Her form flickered, shuddering. She was losing her hold on the plane.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" Queen Wezna asked.</p>

<p>"New Phyrexia's invasion is upon us," the Wanderer said. She looked to the queen, then to Teferi. "Our attack was scattered across the plane, Nissa's gone—I think we're too late. I don't think we can stop them."</p>

<p>A cold moment followed. Teferi stepped back, reached behind him, and sat on the ground. He dropped his head into his hands. All around him, the tombs exploded into action. The queen shouted orders to the three creed leaders, who dispatched their attachés and lieutenants before hurrying to depart for their commands. The Wanderer crouched down next to him and tried to tell him about the battle at Urza's Tower, the raid on New Phyrexia, the growing tree, the desperate plan, but her voice hiccupped and stuttered, and she flickered in and out of coherence. She faded, her unstable spark pulling her away.</p>

<p>Maybe it was the uncanny acoustics of the domed chamber, or some comforting spell he had unconsciously cast, but it all faded to the side, sloughed off like a too-heavy coat. Jabari's voice echoed in his memory. No more apologizing. Teferi pulled his hands away from his face and looked to his palms. Though he washed them many times since that day on the road, they still were tinged with Zhalfir's red earth. He could never wash this land away. He could never be alone.</p>

<p>Eshe, who had weathered the ages.</p>

<p>Oyana, who looked to danger with bravery.</p>

<p>Adia, who longed to build a peaceful future.</p>

<p>Subira, whom he had loved, and who had loved him.</p>

<p>Niambi, whom he loved, and who loved him.</p>

<p>Zhalfir, with whom he stood, father of the creeds, father of a nation.</p>

<p>"It's not too late," Teferi said, a fierce grin spreading across his face. The Phyrexians' probing through the Multiverse had awoken something that their machine minds would learn to fear: Teferi, who would show them that the sun rises in Zhalfir.</p>

The green light lingering in the murky canopy, the rank taste of rotten flesh on the air, the metallic screeches of unseen beasts, the squelch underfoot of the sodden sphagnum—all these details told him he hadn't arrived in the correct location.</p>

<p>"For the life of every plane, we will keep watch." How could he do that from<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> here?</p>

<p>He wasn't with the rest of the strike team. This wasn't the rendezvous location. The Phyrexians must've employed a new defense against the incoming Planeswalkers—they were one step ahead, yet again. He should've known that Jace and the others couldn't be trusted to get a military operation right. When the telepath had tracked him down, Lukka had been expecting an attack because of what he'd done on Ikoria and at Strixhaven. He'd been surprised when Jace had recruited him, arguing that Lukka's military expertise would be essential to the success of their infiltration mission. Lukka had been reluctant. Initially. But when Jace had told him Phyrexia threatened Ikoria, he couldn't stand by. He still cared too much about his home for that.</p>

<p>"So here I am," he murmured to himself, looking around. "Wherever that is."</p>

<p>Irritated, Lukka kicked a sodden lump of turf. It spattered across a nearby tree. The ground was riddled with water-swollen potholes and thick roots—practically impassable. Pulsing veins transported black oil through the dense undergrowth and small suckers protruded from the tree trunks, branches sprouting toward sunlight. He craned his head. The networks of branches above looked walkable.</p>

<p>Overabundant trees<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> putrid, mechanized vegetation? It had to be that place they'd mentioned—the Hunter Maze?</p>

<p>He considered, briefly, trying to planeswalk back. But given that he'd arrived here unexpectedly, there was no guarantee that he'd end up where intended. He might land in an even worse situation. No, he'd go high, try to make it back to the others.</p>

<p><em>If I find a creature I can take and dominate, I'll be able to chart my route toward Elesh Norn's stronghold.</em> He might still have time to make the rendezvous and get back on mission.</p>

<p>He approached the tree trunk. Hand-like leaves curled into fists, cowering from him.</p>

<p>He removed his harpoon from the sheath on his left arm. He aimed, slung it upward. The harpoon caught on a branch overhead. The tree quivered, oozing reddish mucus from the wounds. Lukka tugged on the rope to make sure it was secure and braced his feet in grooves on the trunk. He levered himself upward and began to climb.</p>

<p>It wasn't much different from scaling the cliffs back home. Whatever others said, New Phyrexia was just another plane.</p>

<hr />

<p>An angry cry pierced the air, startling a flock of creatures from their nest in the tree's hollow. The creatures flapped, chaotic and panicked, their toothed beaks glistening silver and their wings the wet color of raw liver. The creatures wheeled—toward the source of the cry.</p>

<p>Lukka cursed. His body, already exhausted from the long climb, shook as he hesitated in place. His hands ached with forming blisters. But he couldn't leave anyone to fight alone in this place. Besides, this might be his opportunity to dominate the local wildlife.</p>

<p>Clenching his thighs around the tree, he removed the harpoon from the bough, untangled the rope, and stowed it away. Then he dropped down onto the platform below. The circling flying creatures gave him a hint as to direction, and he headed that way at a jog, leaping from bough to bough. Excitement flushed the fatigue from his body, turning his tremble into strength and preparing him for the upcoming battle.</p>

<p>On a broad bough, a willowy elf, swinging what looked like a wooden sword, fought alongside a woman dressed in white and gold whose long sword flowed like water. Lukka had seen them before: Nissa, and the woman was called<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> the Wanderer.</p>

<p>A twisted construct that seemed to blend the worst parts of machine and organism attacked them. Its four legs were fused together at awkward angles, yet the Phyrexian had a lethal grace. The Wanderer, a quick blur of white garb and flashing sword, harried the Phyrexian hulk back to give Nissa some room to spellcast. Nissa's tattoos glowed a faint green. Her green cloak aswirl around her, she channeled a spell. Metallic leaves quivered, then were plucked from the tree as if by an invisible hand. The leaves whirled in the air and then descended in a tornado at the abomination. The sharp metal edges shredded the creature. Gray-green blood sprayed.</p>

<p>But the two women hadn't seen the second beast, creeping above them along a branch, ready to pounce.</p>

<p>Lukka reached out with the eludha, the bond he could forge between himself and another creature. He could feel the beast's mind, metallic-bright with pulpy, underused biological elements. He grabbed it and squeezed. Lukka could almost taste blood in his mouth, the tang of iron thick on his tongue. The Phyrexian froze, unable to proceed further. He could feel it rebel against his hold, a thrashing struggle inside his skull.</p>

<p>Nissa and the Wanderer pressed their advantage against their wounded centaur hulk, forward along the bough. It fell, its body draping over the bough and causing the entire tree to shudder. The Wanderer leaped atop its back, bringing her sword down to decapitate the beast. Then, with a strange flicker of light, the Wanderer vanished.</p>

<p>Did she planeswalk away? If so, the timing seemed odd.</p>

<p>Nissa strode forward. She kicked the centaur hulk. It slid from the bough and started its crashing descent to the forest floor below. She cleaned her blade on her cloak and sheathed it.</p>

<p>"Don't get too comfortable." Lukka strode toward her. "I subdued a second looking to ambush you from above."</p>

<p>"Thanks." Nissa turned. Her expression changed. "Lukka."</p>

<p>Lukka nodded up at the centaur hulk above them. It eased itself from the higher bough onto their platform, gentle enough that the branch underfoot did not even bob. "It intended to strip the meat from your bones."</p>

<p>"I don't know how we even ended up here," Nissa said.</p>

<p>"I plan on finding the surface," Lukka said. "Once we're higher we'll be able to get our bearings and plot a route to Elesh Norn's stronghold."</p>

<p>"And how do you plan on navigating this maze?"</p>

<p>Lukka nodded at the Phyrexian monstrosity. It had given into him utterly. He should've known that dominating a half-mechanical creature would be easy. It didn't have the same survival instinct or sense of self that an animal would. It was a mere construct.</p>

<p>"You're bonded with it?" Nissa asked.</p>

<p>She didn't seem happy that he'd saved her life. She eyed him with distrust and concern. He knew this look. He hated it. He'd gotten that look the first time he'd ever bonded with a monster. "It can guide and protect us until we reach the top."</p>

<p>"I don't think it's a good idea for you to bond with a Phyrexian," Nissa said, flatly. "Let's destroy it."</p>

<p>"I've fought monsters my entire life." Now frustrated, Lukka turned away from her. "I can handle it."</p>

<p>Nissa didn't say a word, which was telling enough.</p>

<p>"I promise you," Lukka said, "if I get so much as a stomachache, I'll end the creature."</p>

<p>Nissa stared at him, uncertainly, then she looked around herself at the Hunter Maze. He imagined she was gauging her ability to survive alone, without him, and finding herself lacking. Finally, she sighed.</p>

<p>"I don't like this," Nissa said.</p>

<p>"I am good for my word," he said, irritated.</p>

<p>Nissa nodded. "Let's find the best route out of here."</p>

<p>Lukka plunged his mind into the centaur hulk's consciousness. Its thoughts were jumbled, hard and bright with anger, thick and slimy with shrewdness. He sensed the shape of the thing's territory and frequently traveled paths.</p>

<p>"Ah," he said, with a sigh of soul-deep satisfaction. "We go up, of course."</p>

<p>Nissa seemed annoyed. "I could have told you that."</p>

<hr />

<p>"Up" was easier said than done in the Hunter Maze. First, to get to a scalable "tree," Lukka and Nissa had to cross a cavernous gap between the monolithic boughs. Luckily, and as Lukka had expected, the Phyrexian became useful.</p>

<p>First, he forced it to stretch its massive body between the gaps in the branches. He and Nissa walked across the centaur hulk like a bridge. He could feel its flesh shift beneath his feet as it breathed. Nissa's feet felt like a sharp little patter along its spine. Did she <em>want</em> him to feel her boots digging in?</p>

<p>When they reached the clearest route up—a limbless tree with few hiding spaces for ambush predators—Lukka boarded the centaur hulk. He extended his hand to Nissa. She ignored it and scrambled into place, clenching her legs around the centaur hulk's body like it was a horse. It irritated him. Even the smell of her, lemon-bright, bothered him. What, had she washed her long dark hair in citrus water as a preparation for battle?</p>

<p>But one did not choose their allies. He could follow orders and stay on mission, like any good soldier, and respect the bond that came from fighting alongside an ally.</p>

<p>With a flick of his mind, he urged the centaur hulk up the tree. He hardly even needed to guide it. It leaped upward in jumps, the extra joints in its limbs giving it a rocking, lurching motion. He couldn't brace himself against it. Nor could he move with it.</p>

<p>Nissa seemed uncomfortable.</p>

<p>He craned his head, glimpsing a gap between the boughs with his doubled vision, half his own and half the Phyrexian's. "Brace yourself."</p>

<p>"Braced."</p>

<p>The Phyrexian centaur hulk jumped. Freefall's momentary freedom plunged through Lukka, and they all lurched forward together as it landed. The impact rattled up Lukka's spine.</p>

<p>The centaur hulk swung forward to a platform that jutted from an otherwise limbless tree. The platform looked like a metal-bracket fungus, coated with glowing patches of green, lichen-like lamina.</p>

<p>The centaur hulk plunged its razor-sharp forelimbs into the tree and began its ascent. Lukka leaned forward, pressing his center of gravity close to the centaur hulk's back. He could feel every part of the beast straining as it climbed, its organic heart pounding with fervor, its metallic joints creaking from Lukka and Nissa's combined weight. Nissa clung to Lukka, her thin arm looped around his waist, her cheek to his back.</p>

<p>It was only her feet, he decided, that bothered him: her pointed heels dug into the centaur hulk's body, and he could feel their echo on his own ribs.</p>

<p>He hadn't always been as tall, as strong, as he was now. Once, before he'd hit his growth in adolescence, a group of older boys had cornered him. Already he'd known he was different, though he hadn't understood how. On some level, the other boys had sensed it: an invisible barrier that prevented him from being one of them. They'd cornered him. Five to one. He'd decided to retreat, but they'd tripped him. He'd had to choose while curled up against the blows raining down: head or ribs? He'd wrapped his arms over his skull, and he'd endured.</p>

<p>He'd shown them later, of course. They'd regretted it.</p>

<p>He wanted Nissa to stop. Stop digging her heels in. <em>Stop.</em></p>

<p>He knew she had to hold on. Of course, she did. They weren't his ribs. He said nothing.</p>

<p>The Hunter Maze seemed to murmur around him as if an invisible wind stirred its boughs. But no breath of air troubled the hairs along the nape of his neck. Spores drifted down, glowing green in swirling motes.</p>

<p>Small eyeballs, bulging like knots in the wood, rolled themselves open to watch Lukka and Nissa pass. Fern-like foliage unfurled its blades as if longing for his blood. Small metallic crab-like creatures scuttled between oily pools. He could feel its interconnectedness, the Phyrexians that ambulated through, connected to the Hunter Maze with metallic vines. Now, that would be something, wouldn't it, to dominate an entire ecosystem<nbsp> . . .</nbsp></p>

<p><em>Imagine the power<nbsp> . . .</nbsp></em></p>

<p>A flash of white light.</p>

<p>"Watch out!" the Wanderer shouted. She'd blinked into existence on a tree across from them and now clung to its girth in a bear hug to keep herself from falling.</p>

<p>Lukka searched for the danger.</p>

<p>Leathery wings snapped open near his head. A Phyrexian monstrosity swooped downward, reaching toward Nissa's face with its oil-dripping claws. Nissa gripped him hard with one arm and reached for her sword with her free hand. Lukka tried to twist, to fend the creature off, but it was directly behind him. He couldn't hold onto the hulk and fight at the same time.</p>

<p>The monstrosity swung around, attacking the arm that Nissa gripped him with, ripping at her hand so that she couldn't draw her blade.</p>

<p>Lukka reached toward the Phyrexian centaur hulk with his mind, commanding it to <em>secure me</em>. It did, but not in the way he intended. Veiny wires sprouted from its torso, plunging through his skin and wiggling through his gut to wrap around his spine. It should've hurt. It didn't. <em>This isn't what I meant.</em> Each fiber left a cooling numbness behind it. Lukka felt one with it: his spine cradled, his bones held.</p>

<p>He twisted. His arms now free, he drew his harpoon. He slung it at their attacker. His harpoon pinned the surprised Phyrexian monstrosity to a tree. Oily blood sprayed across his face. He tugged the harpoon free, reeling it back in. The body tumbled to the ground.</p>

<p>The liver-colored scavengers dove after the falling corpse with happy cries. <em>Only the fittest deserve to survive.</em></p>

<p>The Wanderer watched Lukka from her own tree. "I'm useless over here," she muttered, and then, with another flicker, planeswalked away.</p>

<p>Nissa stared at him in horror, her green eyes wide. She had blood on her face. Did she have a head wound? Sometimes even shallow cuts to the scalp could bleed profusely, looking worse than they were. But if she had severe head trauma, she wouldn't be able to fight. He needed to know if he could count on her. He reached down to push her hair back. She recoiled, instinctively, and began to fall. He seized her. Her extra weight caused the centaur hulk to tighten its internal ties on him. It had rooted inside him.</p>

<p>Nissa stopped struggling. She searched their environment as if looking for a location where she could disembark. But there was nothing: only the slick metal trunk and a long drop down. She could either hang on or give up and planeswalk away. She hung on. Her lips grew taut with a frown.</p>

<p>The centaur hulk, and his bond with it, had saved them both.</p>

<hr />

<p>He and Nissa had reached a high point in the Hunter Maze's canopy. The light here was brighter, a hotter and richer yellow, like butter on his tongue. The "tree" the Phyrexian was scaling had narrowed, now thin enough that it trembled under their weight.</p>

<p><em>You deserve power. You are strong. Here, strength is rewarded. The weak are culled.</em></p>

<p>He didn't know whether it was as obvious to Nissa as it was to him, but now they'd reached a height that they needed to move parallel to the ground again, perhaps even until they'd reached the forest's edge. The intertwining branches, gnarled as wood but made of metal and flesh, formed a network of roads that life traveled upon. Leaves glimmered, fist-size stomata opening and closing as the trees breathed. Berries, large as severed heads, dangled in bunches. Flowers, intestine-pink and rank as a butcher's shop, dripped black oil.</p>

<p>He hadn't noticed how beautiful it all was until now.</p>

<p>The centaur hulk leaped from their tree to the next, landing hard on another bracket mushroom platform. Lukka ordered it to withdraw its tendrils. It did so without protest. He disembarked. Nissa eyed his stomach but there was no sign the Phyrexian had ever been inside him except for a few tears in his shirt, which could have come from anything. Not even one drop of blood marred the fabric.</p>

<p>Nissa walked to the platform's edge. She looked around as if searching for the route. She shook her head, finding nothing. He had the sense that if the path had divided, she would've suggested that they part ways. But it didn't. The greenery was so dense he could see only one way forward. So, her choice was to go with him or planeswalk home. The Phyrexian's mind told him that this was the correct route.</p>

<p>Nissa fell into step beside him. She only twined her fingers together and stretched them, now gazing upward. "I still can't see the exit."</p>

<p>"It's there." He could feel the sun's life-giving warmth along his back. Really, when he thought about it, these trees were perfect organisms, so large and strong with so little to sustain them. <em>You are like that, too. You have always taken what you've been given. You've made the best of what you had.</em></p>

<p>The path led into a sphincter-like opening. It lay open, panting in the dimness.</p>

<p>"Come on." He headed into it.</p>

<p>"Wait—" Nissa pursued him, and then stopped.</p>

<p>The opening sucked shut behind them. Nissa pivoted toward him. She gave him a suspicious once-over but said nothing.</p>

<p>He resumed walking. The Phyrexian centaur hulk trotted ahead, obedient.</p>

<p>The passage's smell reminded him of a battlefield: the stink of blood and emptied bowels. The dim walls around him glowed with the lamina's sickly green light, and the passage's fronded surface waved them forward, like the cilia inside a gut.</p>

<p>Nissa followed him, reluctant. She was so ready to criticize him, but it wasn't like she had a better plan. He was the one who'd gotten them both this far, practically dragging her dead weight. He didn't even know why Nissa had chosen to participate in this attack.</p>

<p><em>The less deserving should perish to make way for those who are smarter and more ruthless.</em></p>

<p>He'd always believed in meritocracy. Excellence, skill, training, talent: that's how he'd risen to captaincy of the Specials.</p>

<p>A motion between his shirt and his skin caught his attention. He poked his fingers through the holes in his clothing, expecting to find a trapped mosquito.</p>

<p>Something grabbed his finger, soft and sucker-like.</p>

<p>He cast a glance behind him, but Nissa searched the passage for danger. She wasn't looking at him.</p>

<p>He peeked through a hole in his shirt. Some Phyrexian rootlets had remained inside him. Now they kissed his fingers, like sea anemones.</p>

<p><em>What if you never felt pain or fear? What if you only ever felt certainty and belonging—the knowledge that what you do is right because you're the one who's doing it?</em></p>

<p>"What is it?" Nissa asked.</p>

<p>Lukka pulled his fingers back guiltily. He'd told her that he would back down if he experienced any physical changes as a result of his bond with the Phyrexian abomination. But those delicate tendrils, pulsing at his fingertips wetly, didn't hurt. He felt healthier, stronger, more confident—more like himself than he'd felt in a long time.</p>

<p>He smiled at Nissa.</p>

<p>"I think you bruised my ribs during the climb," he said. "Holding onto me so tight. Scared, were you?"</p>

<p>Nissa frowned. "Are you sure we're going the right way?"</p>

<p>"Very."</p>

<p>Around him, the walls sighed in satisfaction. He headed in deeper, toward the sound. Did Nissa hear it, too? He thought maybe that he heard voices. Not whispers, but murmurs. Perhaps they were headed toward a group of fellow Planeswalkers, also separated during the initial attack. But more likely, he guessed, they walked toward the enemy.</p>

<p>He would've thought that after the climb, after several fights, he would've been achy—but he wasn't. His knees did feel different, as did the joints of his hips—like they'd reformed themselves into a stronger, more efficient shape.</p>

<p><em>There is strength in change and power in flexibility. Only winning matters.</em></p>

<p>A swarm of leech-like creatures emerged from the cilia around them. Their bodies razor-sharp and glistening with teeth, they seethed toward Lukka with surprising speed. The Phyrexian centaur hulk lunged into action, squashing the pulpy creatures.</p>

<p>The Wanderer flickered into existence beside them. For a split second, she seemed confused but then launched herself into action, drawing her blade and slicing through the creatures in long, devastating arcs.</p>

<p>"Out of one danger, into another," she muttered.</p>

<p>Nissa chopped through the creatures with her own sword and kicked them away before they could scramble up her legs. Lukka didn't even draw his harpoon. It wouldn't be effective against creatures as insubstantial as these—they were so small he could grab them and rip them in two. His hands, his fingers, felt sharp, metallic. He couldn't remember when that change had occurred, but it must've been recent. He could slice the swarming creatures open with his fingernails, scattering pearls of purple guts to the ground. But they kept coming.</p>

<p>The ground beneath them heaved awake, and he realized they'd walked into the mother-creature, lodged on the floor of the passage, her babies buried in her flesh like pustules. The floor contorted again, teeth emerging, multiple mouths opening at his feet.</p>

<p>The Wanderer yelped and sprinted out of the beast's mouth.</p>

<p>Nissa grabbed his hand and pulled Lukka forward. The two leaped out of the beast's maw onto the flatter, dryer, and more metallic floor ahead.</p>

<p>Behind them, the mother-beast curled upward and around the Phyrexian centaur hulk to engulf it. Its anguished, furious pain roared through Lukka. How could he have ever thought that this creature was mechanical, emotionless? No, it had been subdued, lying in wait, evaluating him<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> He ran forward.</p>

<p>"Don't!" Nissa said. "Just leave it!"</p>

<p>But strength like he'd never known before coursed through him and he sprang forward—in a leap that defied gravity, propelling himself into the creature's central maw. <em>These changes don't seem so bad, Nissa. They're useful, more than anything.</em></p>

<p>His fingernails, gleaming like metal, were so sharp, his hands were so sharp, he sliced right through the mother-monstrosity. He pulled apart a lip of flesh and freed his Phyrexian. The entrapping creature, split in two, shuddered with its gooey death throes. Its arterial spurts slowed as it died. Its children scattered and fled.</p>

<p>The Phyrexian centaur hulk staggered forward and lay down, prostrate with gratitude, at Lukka's feet.</p>

<p>The Wanderer had cut a strip of white fabric from her clothes to bind a wound in Nissa's forearm. One of the leech-like creatures must've removed a chunk of flesh.</p>

<p>"Are you strong enough to continue?" He tried to be sympathetic. <em>Only survivors deserve to live. The strong have the right to slay the weak. The duty.</em></p>

<p>"We should planeswalk out of here," Nissa said.</p>

<p>"We've almost reached the maze's center," Lukka said.</p>

<p>Nissa gave him a hard look. "We were trying to get <em>out</em>. To the <em>surface</em>."</p>

<p>Lukka frowned. He couldn't remember when his goals had changed. Had they changed? He felt like he'd been headed in this direction all along. He pondered this, staring down at his arms and hands. The problem, of course, with sticking his hands into the creatures to fight them was that he'd gotten bite marks all over him. He hadn't noticed at the time, and they didn't hurt now. They'd already started to scab, thick blackish crusts forming over each wound.</p>

<p>"What do you think?" Lukka asked the Wanderer, finally. "Have you been in contact with the other Planeswalkers? Should we retreat?"</p>

<p>The Wanderer hesitated, then shook her head. "I've seen a lot of this plane as I've tried to remain stable. One of the things I saw was Vorinclex."</p>

<p>Lukka picked at a scab. When it came away, underneath, he saw wriggling, maggot-like motion. Beneath that, his ulna glistened—metallic. A bone-deep wound, he marveled, and it didn't even hurt.</p>

<p>"Vorinclex," Nissa repeated.</p>

<p>"Yes," the Wanderer said. "We're close. You're close. What's more, I think Vorinclex is recovered from his journey to Kaldheim. We need to take him down before he hurts anyone else."</p>

<p>"That's not what we're here to do," Nissa said. "We should get back to the others."</p>

<p>For once, Lukka agreed with her. "It's off mission."</p>

<p>"It's an opportunity," the Wanderer said—then, in a white flash of light, she planeswalked involuntarily away.</p>

<p>Nissa seemed to be thinking. "I don't know if we could find the others, even if we tried. If we killed one of the Norn's allies, though, it might give them a better chance."</p>

<p>Lukka considered. To get this close and not attack<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> well, it would be cowardly. "You're right. So's the Wanderer. We take out Vorinclex."</p>

<p>Nissa scrutinized him as if gauging his worth as an ally. "Which way?"</p>

<hr />

<p>It got easier as they approached the center of the maze—either it was unguarded or something greater and more predatory had devoured the smaller monstrosities. The thick susurrus of voices, all unintelligible, was so loud that it made thought impossible.</p>

<p>Lukka had to wonder why Nissa didn't show any signs of disturbance. Perhaps she was tougher than he'd thought.</p>

<p>The cilia lining the maze walls all waved as if an invisible current pulled them toward the center medallion. In Vorinclex's chamber, the cilia grew thicker and longer and paler, a glistening, yellowy white, and the floor depressed into a cavernous hole that resembled a starfish's mouth. He heard a metal clash, the unmistakable sound of blade on blade, followed by the harsh slide of a parry. Then he saw them.</p>

<p>Vorinclex fought a Phyrexian elf beneath the monstrous skulls that hung from the ceiling. The elf seemed fused with copper metal plates and needed no sword. Her arm was a blade. Glissa. That was her name. He'd met her, briefly. Vorinclex towered over her, twelve feet of metal, bone, and weeping flesh. He brought his muscular arms down onto Glissa as if trying to pin her to the floor with his massive talons. Glissa spun aside with an echoing laugh, the writhing copper cords of her hair flowing behind her.</p>

<p>Lukka couldn't tell if they battled or if they played.</p>

<p>Glissa flanked Vorinclex, bringing her bladed arm down across his furred shoulders, and Vorinclex met her, parrying her blow again. Lukka had never seen such a joyous expression of combat. The two of them danced—almost seemed to float—across the bobbing, pallid cilia on the floor.</p>

<p>Nissa grasped his wrist. She whispered, "The two of us could've taken Vorinclex. Maybe. But both Vorinclex <em>and</em> Glissa."</p>

<p>"There's two of them and two of us," Lukka said.</p>

<p>Nissa gave him a sharp look. "Kaya said she could barely handle Vorinclex alone."</p>

<p>"We can do it."</p>

<p>"Are you listening to me?" Nissa hissed.</p>

<p>"We also have my ally. The Phyrexian abomination."</p>

<p>Without another word, Lukka charged in. Nissa, behind him, let out a string of curses that would've made even Chandra blush. But she followed right at his heels, like he knew she would. She would not let an ally face combat alone.</p>

<p>Lukka threw himself at Glissa while Nissa fought Vorinclex.</p>

<p>Glissa spun, with a hiss, and threw up her clawed hands in defense. Lukka didn't need a weapon to attack her—he, too, had his own claws. He exchanged blows with Glissa, and she grinned. They were perfectly matched. He hadn't felt like this in years, not since his last great sparring match in the Coppercoats. Glissa seemed to feel the same, and he could hear himself laughing—laughing with pure happiness.</p>

<p>But then Lukka stumbled.</p>

<p>Glissa lunged forward, ready to spear him through with her bladed arm. As if he'd let her! He didn't want this fight to end.</p>

<p>He used his eludha. His Phyrexian ally rushed into the fight. <em>Join me</em>, he told it, craving its power, its strength. The Phyrexian flowed into him. Its tendrils writhed into his body. The rootlets inside him sprung out to meet it. He could feel the Phyrexian move into him and then <em>become</em> him. His skin split like it was overripe, more than ready for this change. His body folded outward like a blossoming flower, his ribs opening as the Phyrexian lodged itself inside him, its arms becoming his arms.</p>

<p>It was ready to serve him until the end. To lose its life to save him. Such loyalty. It was his, obedient and submissive in every way.</p>

<p>His spine became its spine, and he stood now upon its legs, towering over Glissa. He had his arms, still, sharper and defter, but the Phyrexian's arms now formed a second set of arms with a greater reach. He'd always felt like his weapon was part of him—now it was. He stabbed at Glissa, and she danced back atop the cilia with a bright, encouraging laugh.</p>

<p>Lukka's match with Glissa had brought him closer to Nissa and Vorinclex's. Nissa hadn't done badly. The praetor bled ichor from a dozen slashes along its body.</p>

<p>"Get—the elf," Vorinclex rasped.</p>

<p>Nissa glanced at him. Then she glanced again: disgusted and horrified. She backed off. She was outnumbered and she knew it.</p>

<p>Lukka advanced on Nissa. He was one with the centaur hulk, and combined with it, they were both mightier. Nissa retreated cautiously, anger and fear overwriting the horror on her features. Finally, she feared him. Respected him.</p>

<p><em>This is how it's supposed to be. The strong triumphing over the weak. This is how life is. This is what living means. </em>He learned that lesson well when his bond was revealed and his people had turned against him. He always knew he wanted to be the one who was hitting, not the one who was being hit, because there are only two types of people in this world.<em> There are those who take it, then there are those who deal it.</em> Nissa maintained her steady return toward the passage that they'd used to enter Vorinclex's chambers. Nissa had her sword up, guarding against a blow from him. It looked like she was thinking, trying to decide whether to stay in the Hunter Maze or planeswalk away. He had to get her now, before she escaped. He raised his hands and advanced on Nissa, reveling in their sharpness—he didn't need a weapon, he <em>was</em> the weapon.</p>

<p>The Wanderer flickered back into existence between him and Nissa, and she instinctively raised her sword in a parry. His hands slammed down into it, but she caught the blow, gritting her teeth against the weight of it, and forcing him away.</p>

<p>"Lukka?" Then her battle anger, too, transformed into confusion. "Nissa, run!"</p>

<p>Nissa gave him a pained, furious look.</p>

<p>And she ran.</p>

<p>"By the Nine Hells, not this—" the Wanderer said and flickered away.</p>

<p>Glissa smiled at him, the visible mechanism along her jaw and cheek revealing her raw beauty. He'd earned this. He'd always known he was different, given his ability to bond with animals. He'd always known he was better. He could return home and there wasn't a monster on the plane that could challenge him now.</p>

<p>He'd finally become himself, who he was meant to be.</p>

<p>"Stop," Glissa said, and Lukka stopped, waiting for further instruction. "Find the elf, Lukka. But do not kill her. New Phyrexia will have a use for her in the war to come."</p>

<p>Beside him, he heard Vorinclex's low, growling laughter, he felt the vicarious pleasure that Glissa took in his confidence, and he felt himself smile. The Hunter Maze was expansive, and beautiful, and terrible—and it was time to go hunting.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Phyrexia: All Will Be One | A Hollow Body</title><link>https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/magic-story/a-hollow-body</link><guid>https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/magic-story/a-hollow-body</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>The Dross Pits stink.</p>

<p>You stand at the base of the vault, staring up the steaming shaft wall. You can smell the necrogen from here, at the Basilica's summit. Little eddies of it swirl above you, like figures beckoning you up. Movement between the spheres is heavily monitored, but this shaft is far enough on the outer reaches that no one will be watching. At least, no one with a hope of stopping you.</p>

<p>You spread your wings, relishing the pull in your shoulders as your body does what it is made for. A few flaps are enough to propel you up into the shaft, splitting the necrogen clouds, leaving a trail in your wake. Nothing challenges you, though a couple skitterlings clinging to the slick walls turn to you with rumbling growls that quickly become pathetic screams as you separate their heads from their bodies with a sweep of your spear. You smell the spill of their fluids as it rains down to the sphere below. Back to where your superior waits for news of your success.</p>

<hr />

<p><em>"Do you know of the traitor Geth?"</em></p>

<p><em>You bow your head and say nothing, the marble cold beneath your knees. It is not a question that needs an answer. Everyone knows of the lich, the tainted Phyrexian with the incompleat head. An unclean mark on spotless linen.</em></p>

<p><em>"I want you to seek him out, Ixhel. I want you to end him."</em></p>

<p><em>You raise your eyes slowly from the floor.</em></p>

<p><em>Above you is the throne, a dais crowned with a coruscating confection of bone and porcelain, pure Phyrexian workmanship. The seat is empty; without the demands of a council meeting, Elesh Norn, Mother of Machines, retires to her contemplation. Instead, you kneel before Atraxa, the Grand Unifier, and the reason for which you draw breath.</em></p>

<p><em>"Geth is one of the seven Steel Thanes of the Dross Pits, a sphere that has already caused us considerable annoyance," Atraxa says, her voice as brisk as a whip. "I ask that you boil that number down to six. Bring me his filthy head."</em></p>

<p><em>"It will be done," you say, intoning the words. "I foresee no difficulties."</em></p>

<p><em>Atraxa makes a slippery noise in the back of her throat. "No," she says. "You wouldn't, would you? You are my most perfect creation."</em></p>

<p><em>Atraxa reaches for you, and you quickly drop your eyes back to the bloody red of the carpet. Her fingertips caress your cheek, and you feel a brief flare of something inside you, where a lesser creature's heart might be. It's something beyond loyalty, beyond the just desire to spread the Machine Orthodoxy across the Multiverse.</em></p>

<p><em>You ignore it and hope it goes away.</em></p>

<p><em>So far, it always has.</em></p>

<hr />

<p>You locate a bit of high ground, which is easier said than done—this sphere is called the Dross Pits for a reason. The landscape is shallow, pockmarked with glowing pools of liquid necrogen, shining bright and poisonous. Humped, crude structures of black-gilded bone break up the horizon. You feel your lip curling. You know that every sphere has its purpose in the perfect unity of New Phyrexia, but you can't help your disgust. Not when you have the serenity of the Fair Basilica to compare to the rest.</p>

<p>Fortunately, you expect this will be a short trip. Your words to Atraxa were not hubris—you have felled every creature that has ever stood against you.</p>

<p>You face little opposition as you pick our way across the landscape, breathing in corrosive air as you go, giving the glowing pools a wide berth.</p>

<p>Before long, your advance is halted. Geth's fortress is visible beyond the next rise, but the path is blocked by a sheer cliff of shining black rock. You could climb it, but that would take time. You could fly over it, but that would announce our presence to the entire sphere, which you've been told to avoid, when possible. You are still a long way from a last resort.</p>

<p>Stepping into the shadow of the rock face, you see the outline of a gate. It looks like it could almost be naturally occurring, as if the supersaturated atmosphere has given the rock a mind of its own, like a Dominus. There is no latch, no lock. Instead, you find a row of rounded impressions arrayed in a fan-like shape at shoulder height. You press your palm against one.</p>

<p>A low tone pulses out from within the stone. You take a step back. It fades so quickly you are unsure if you truly heard it. You press the spot again. The same tone comes. You press each impression in turn, and each makes a slightly different sound.</p>

<p>You cock your head and press them again. Something about the sounds itches at the inside of your brain. You don't like it.</p>

<p>"You need to press them in the right order."</p>

<p>The voice comes from behind you, slippery and slick, all sibilants, but it chokes off at the end when you spin and slam its owner back against the craggy ground, squeezing your fingers down on its neck.</p>

<p>"Please," it chokes out.</p>

<p>That, combined with the ease with which it folds underneath you, stays your hand for long enough to get a look at it.</p>

<p>"N—Now I know what you're thinking—" the thing stammers. You tighten your hand on its neck, even as you find yourself mildly surprised that it <em>has </em>a neck. A face. A midsection. Bare and unsightly hands. It's an aspirant—a male human, or an elf. Originally from the Hunter Maze, perhaps, a sphere several levels above, judging from its smell and the hue and shape of its compleation.</p>

<p>"Mercy!" It's shouting in your ear. "Mercy!"</p>

<p>You sneer. "Identify yourself, creature."</p>

<p>"Belaxis!" he pipes up. "I'm Belaxis. You can't kill me."</p>

<p>"I can," you say.</p>

<p>"No! I mean, I believe you, I believe you!" The aspirant shakes. His voice goes slightly nasal with fear. "I just mean, you shouldn't kill me! Please don't kill me!"</p>

<p>Your head tilts. "Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because I don't want to die!"</p>

<p>Your head keeps tilting. "Why?"</p>

<p>"Right, that—" The aspirant is breathing heavily, its brittle, defenseless ribcage going up and down. The movement is distasteful, but compelling. "Right, that's a good question. Philosophical. Why don't <em>you</em> want to die?"</p>

<p>You consider the question. You know the correct answer. The answer that any Phyrexian would be expected to give. Why would anyone fear death when no individual holds any value? Every life in every sphere exists purely to spread the truth of Phyrexia across the Multiverse. There is no other reason to be alive.</p>

<p>Still, the thought unsettles something in the core of you. You try to evaluate why.</p>

<p>"Because I am needed," you decide.</p>

<p>The aspirant snorts air through the disgusting little holes in his face. "Don't you think highly of yourself," he mutters. "Not that you shouldn't!" he adds hastily, as you begin to squeeze down again. Before you can completely compress his voice to nothing, he yells, "You can't kill me! I have a contract with Lord Geth!"</p>

<p>That makes you pause. "What?"</p>

<p>"L—Lord Geth." The aspirant is breathing fast. He reeks of fear. What is a half-compleated weakling doing in a place like this? He should have been ripped to shreds in the Hunter Maze within a day. "Lord Geth makes deals. That's why they call him the Thane of Contracts!"</p>

<p>"Who calls him that?" That hadn't been part of your brief.</p>

<p>"Lord Geth saves people. With his deals!" The aspirant's eyes gleam and glisten. They're filling up with some strange clear oil.</p>

<p>"He makes what?"</p>

<p>"Deals! Protection. He can move you between spheres. Well." The aspirant gives you a quick, nervous look. "Not <em>him</em>, exactly. He made a contract with me and got me out of the Hunter Maze. He saved me. And now I guard the gate to his holdings."</p>

<p>"If I kill you, this gate opens?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Wait! No!" The aspirant's breath quickens again. "That's not how it works. If you kill me, it will never open! Never ever! Besides, Lord Geth will know and he'll come and find you!"</p>

<p>You sit back, slightly bemused. Are all aspirants so lively? You've never been in the position to find out. "If I kill you, Lord Geth will know?"</p>

<p>"Yes!"</p>

<p>"How will he know?"</p>

<p>"Not sure. Kill me and find out."</p>

<p>You heft your spear.</p>

<p>"I'm kidding, I'm kidding! He'll just know!"</p>

<p>You consider this new option. Could you simply kill this aspirant and smoke out the lich that way? Your orders are different. But this might be faster.</p>

<p>No. You cannot stray.</p>

<p>"I can help you!"</p>

<p>"You? Don't speak nonsense, creature."</p>

<p>"I told you, my name is Belaxis!" He does not seem to be seeping from the eyes anymore, at least. "What's yours?"</p>

<p>"Ixhel," you say. "Of the Fair Basilica."</p>

<p>Belaxis's stares. Perhaps you should not have offered this worthless being your name. But neither are you willing to deny it.</p>

<p>"Ixhel." Belaxis the aspirant rolls it around his strange pink mouth. "Ixhel. I can help you! You want through that door, right? I can help you."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"The puzzle! I can help you with the door puzzle."</p>

<p>You stand up sharply. "I can do it myself."</p>

<p>This, you worry, may be hubris.</p>

<p>The sounds make no sense, or not enough for you to decode them. It annoys you. The sounds itch at your brain; you think you should know what they mean, recognize the pattern they build.</p>

<p>Behind you, Belaxis keeps up a steady stream of chattering.</p>

<p>"Hmm, see—you're tall enough to hit all the plates! That's useful for something like this, but your back might start hurting. Oh! Start with the one on the far left—"</p>

<p>"I guess being tall is less useful when you're flying—do those wings work? I bet it's hard for you to stay upright when you're in the air. Can you fight while you fly? Oh, the two in the middle need to be pressed together—!"</p>

<p>"Wow, the Fair Basilica, I've never seen it. Right, where would I have seen it, huh? Is it as pretty as you are? There, on the right!"</p>

<p>You grind your teeth together, but you take the advice, using the hints to string the sounds together. Phyrexians all operate toward a common goal. Disregarding help because the one offering it has an abrasive, reedy voice would be counterproductive.</p>

<p>"Ah, there you go, there you go!"</p>

<p>The door flashes with a thin blue light, and the gate grinds open. You feel a thrill of warm victory most often associated with rending a creature in half. It almost makes you want to turn around and bury your spear in the aspirant's throat.</p>

<p>You turn to find him standing upright, looking off into the distance. The cool, radioactive light of the pits gleams off the green and silver armor plating his torso and thighs. The bare, not yet compleated parts of his body are soft, almost obscene. Surely, you'd never looked so very frail.</p>

<p>He just sits here all day, waiting for someone like you to come along and try the gate. What would that be like? How does he stay still with all that clamoring going on inside his head? He must enjoy the time he spends here if he is so intent on staying alive. Curious.</p>

<p>You turn back to the open gate, the tunnel lit only by a thin stream of necrogen trailing down the middle. You wrinkle your nose, but you pick your way inside.</p>

<p>"Goodbye, Lady Ixhel!" Belaxis calls after you. "Give Lord Geth my regards!"</p>

<p>You don't meet anyone quite as odd or talkative on your way through Lord Geth's holding, but you do see more aspirants than you have in a long time. Creatures from across New Phyrexia. From all spheres. Some halfway through compleation, some whose compleation had gone wrong. They should have been scrapped before they even took their first breath; had Geth made deals with them as well?</p>

<p>Strange. Strange how these half-creatures' minds work. Binding themselves to a monstrous, blasphemous creature for nothing but the promise of the continuity of their own worthless lives? You can't fathom it. The only reason to exist is to spread perfection across the Multiverse. If you can't do that, why wouldn't you allow yourself to be taken apart, to be compleated into something that can?</p>

<p>You meet no great resistance on your journey, save for a few more skitterlings that try their luck, as they always do. You locate Geth's fortress easily enough—it is a blight on the horizon. A colossal structure of black bone and red sinew, grown from the burning earth of the sphere's necrogen-consecrated ground.</p>

<p>This gate is not guarded, nor does it have a silly little puzzle. The door stands open before you. No one challenges you on the stairs, and no one challenges you as you pass into the grand hall. It's as still as a grave.</p>

<p>Stepping through a low, black arch, rage begins to fill you. This is a throne room. A tall, towering imitation of Elesh Norn's throne stands between guttering torches. It is empty.</p>

<p>How dare he? How dare he compare himself to the Mother of Machines? The impertinence is unbelievable.</p>

<p>"Fool." Your voice echoes through the wide hall. "Lich. Abomination! Where are you?"</p>

<p>"You're smaller than I thought you'd be," says a voice in your ear. "Curious."</p>

<p>This is the second time some creeping thing has managed to catch you by surprise. This time you heft your spear, twisting in midair. The clash is hard enough to send shocks all the way down to your core. Very narrowly, you keep your feet.</p>

<p>"Good. Seems you aren't all bravado."</p>

<p>Before you stands Lord Geth.</p>

<p>His heaving, many-limbed body looms above you, arachnid legs planted in the marble floor. His hideous face peers down. He possesses none of Belaxis's energy or lithe grace, but for some reason, you can't help thinking of him as you look into Lord Geth's eyes. He holds your spear between two of his pincers.</p>

<p>"I assume the Mother has finally sent you for my head," he says. "She does so hate it."</p>

<p>You grip your sword and widen your stance. Geth is larger than you'd been expecting, his body more fully compleated. In fact, it is only his head that is still organic. An ugly, rotting thing in the center of an otherwise serviceable body. You hate it more than you'd hated Belaxis, because at least that wasn't his fault. Geth, you know, had insisted on this, refused to ever fully submit.</p>

<p>"It's disgusting," you sneer. "It becomes you."</p>

<p>Geth laughs. His eyes burn. "How low I have fallen in her notice, that she sends me a foot soldier, rather than a praetor. Not even the Unifier. How is Atraxa, then?"</p>

<p>You glow with rage. A <em>foot soldier</em>? You? How many corpses have you retrieved for compleation?</p>

<p><em>That doesn't matter</em>, you tell yourself. It doesn't matter what he thinks of you. You don't matter at all.</p>

<p>"You don't have the right to even say her name," you hiss. "To even think it."</p>

<p>Geth laughs again. He meets your next attack with a lazy swipe of a claw, deflecting with seemingly no strength at all. The blow still rattles through you. You grit your teeth so as not to let him see your shock.</p>

<p>Stupid. Stupid of you to assume he wouldn't put up a fight. You've gotten too used to fighting the incompleat, worthless little organics who don't stand a chance against the might of a true Phyrexian.</p>

<p>"You're rusty, I see," Geth says. "You've been fighting creatures who can't fight back." He reads you like he has access to your thoughts. "Picking your teeth on my contract-holders, were you?"</p>

<p>"As if I'd dent my blade on such a worthless enemy," you sneer.</p>

<p>"Yes, you would say that, wouldn't you?" Geth's strikes grow more powerful as he speaks. You hear the whistle of air as they narrowly miss you. "But that's what you and your ilk will never understand. The only true loyalty is that which can be bought."</p>

<p>"Foolish." Nonsense. He's speaking the same drivel Belaxis did, trying to trick you. Pathetic, that a thane would share an affliction with a half-compleated runt. No wonder your commanders want him dead.</p>

<p>And yet, his power is undeniable.</p>

<p>"You doubt me? For what reason do you fight then, child of the Machine Orthodoxy?"</p>

<p>"My name is Ixhel," you grit out.</p>

<p>Geth grins. The elasticity of his face is disgusting. You aren't used to seeing such things. "Ixhel. A good name for another Phyrexian doll."</p>

<p>You spit. "You think you insult me?"</p>

<p>"An audience's disinterest does not make the joke any less amusing."</p>

<p>Jokes. Hah. You'll tell <em>him</em> what a joke is. Especially now that you are beginning to realize that it makes far more sense to avoid his blows than try to parry them. He is right about one thing—fighting nobodies has made you soft. You weren't prepared for someone with his kind of strength.</p>

<p>"And now you're scurrying around like a rat," Geth says in that deep, sonorous voice. "Are you afraid to stand and fight?" He takes another broad swing, forcing you to hop back in an ungainly scrabble. The bone marble is unfamiliar beneath your feet; you keep sliding. You should have forced him to come out and fight you under the sky.</p>

<p>"No wonder you're weak," Geth says with another laugh. "None of you understand the victory born out of true struggle. The struggle to survive."</p>

<p>"You know nothing!"</p>

<p>"I know more than you think." Geth's ugly face is smiling at you now, a hideous rictus. "I know that what really makes a warrior is the knowledge that if you lose, you die. Not that if you lose, there will be thousands of faceless others to take your place. Your ubiquity makes you weak."</p>

<p>"You're wrong," you shout back.</p>

<p>"Am I?" The flames of the torches burnish Geth's hard, armored back. "Then why don't you lay down your arms and die? Surely your commander can simply send the next version of you."</p>

<p>Belaxis had said much the same thing, if not in so many words. You worry, for a split second, that they have been in communication. That Belaxis is a direct report to the thane, instead of just a worthless underling. You dismiss it. It doesn't matter.</p>

<p>Geth has stopped attacking, so you stop, too, doing everything you can to hide that you are already exhausted.</p>

<p>Somehow, Geth is still talking. "When you win, what will hold your people to you? When you spread yourselves across the Multiverse?"</p>

<p>You wish you could cover your ears. You howl, brandishing your spear. Geth, in an explosion of speed beyond anything he's displayed previously, bursts through your guard, catching you around the throat with a pincer. You freeze.</p>

<p>He hauls you close, breath hot and fetid. "What about you, little emissary? When you have burned down the rest of the plane, what will you have to sustain you beyond your orthodoxy? The love of that strange, harsh mother?"</p>

<p>The question reverberates inside you. <em>What do you have to live for? Why do you exist?</em></p>

<p>With a hard scream of rage, you drag your throat along the blade, opening it up in a wash of hot blood and oil. Wrenching yourself out of Geth's grasp, you bring down your blade in a single stroke, parting his head from his body. You catch it, your voice gurgling in your ruined throat.</p>

<p>"Rot in the ground, you worthless creature. Your contracts were as valuable as your pathetic life, in the end."</p>

<p>The pain is searing, but it is nothing when compared to the ecstasy of your victory. And as that ecstasy grows, so does a desire. It is overpowering. It drives you to your knees.</p>

<p>This fool, this monster. He doesn't deserve the ease of death. You hate him, you hate him! And yet, as your throat knits itself closed, you feel the give of the flesh beneath your fingertips, the dully glowing eyes going cloudy. They are almost beautiful now, beautiful like the gleam of green and silver around vulnerable flesh.</p>

<p>Geth's head gibbers with words you deem as little more than nonsense. What could he have been if he'd only submitted? If he'd only realized the truth.</p>

<p>Maybe, in this, you can help him.</p>

<hr />

<p>The Dross Pits are a filthy, disreputable hole, to be sure, but they do have their moments.</p>

<p>Dominating the landscape, more imposing even than Lord Geth's tower, is the Dominus of Pain. When Phyrexians first settled this plane and the glistening oil, in all its glory, began transforming it to its right and true state, parts of the land awoke. They moved, shook themselves, and began to wander.</p>

<p>No one truly knows what the Domini are, whether they think and desire the same way other Phyrexians do. If they wish, as is right, to bring everything under the dominion of the Machine Orthodoxy.</p>

<p>But you know what this Dominus craves, and a towering, razor-edged monolith standing against the sky is fully equipped to harvest it. It is a short flight away from Geth's tower, and you no longer care who sees you. But Geth's words still shiver inside you, pulsing and strange.</p>

<p>The Dominus is at rest. It doesn't look at you. It shifts and murmurs, burnished bones whispering in the wind. Rot perfumes the air. Bodies—all sorts, from skitterlings to aspirants to a single ragged priest—hang fluttering in the breeze, impaled through with the Dominus's vicious spines. Each of them will have been chosen and placed with care, their screams and twitches drunk down with rapt attention.</p>

<p>You don't understand the Dominus, but you'll make use of it.</p>

<p>A piercing wail rings out across the wastes as you pin the writhing body in your arms down onto a razor-tipped spoke on the Dominus's east side. Bright blood gleams dark in the cold necrogen light. It's impossibly warm on your hands.</p>

<p>"Why?" croaks Belaxis. The aspirant's back arches in a perfect, clean line. The bone spur protrudes from his abdomen, whiter than even his incompleat flesh.</p>

<p>"Why?" His voice cracks. "I helped you."</p>

<p>Your fingers move down to cup his chin, pulling him up. His face is twisting, eloquent with pain, shaking with it. His body, covered in soft, violable skin, feels so much more than yours.</p>

<p>"I know," you say, as you watch him writhe. "And I'm grateful."</p>

<hr />

<p>After the darkness of the higher spheres, the pure white of the Fair Basilica is almost blinding. Standing in the throne room, gazing up at the seat of the Mother of Machines, the grandeur nearly sends you to your knees.</p>

<p>You've spent the last few days in the poisonous chill of the Surgical Bay, sitting and watching as your creation is made manifest. That sphere belongs to Jin-Gitaxias, an inventor and visionary, but if you want to use the equipment, who would stop you? Nobody was foolish enough to try.</p>

<p>At the end of the process, you stood looking at your creation, a strange feeling welling up inside you, not dissimilar to the experience of tearing an enemy limb from limb. Except this time, you have made something.</p>

<p>You have made something, and you bring it home with you.</p>

<p>"Ixhel." Atraxa is elegant and upright, the ideal Phyrexian. The Grand Unifier, the perfect weapon in battle. She brings life to the Machine Orthodoxy. She spreads the glistening oil across the Multiverse. She is the only true voice you will ever answer to.</p>

<p>And now she looks upon what you have brought her with such disdain you feel like the plane has cracked open.</p>

</div>

<p>"Ixhel. What have you done?"</p>

<p>Silence thunders around you. In the distance, chanting rises like a sinister wind through hanging bones. Your breaths feel like knives.</p>

<p>"Commander—"</p>

<p>"Answer me."</p>

<p>You fall to your knees. "I only, I only wanted to make something." You risk a glance up, your body burning. "Like you made me."</p>

<p>Atraxa stares down at you. "I fashioned a weapon. That's what you are."</p>

<p>"I know, I know. I just thought—"</p>

<p>Atraxa lets out a harsh laugh you've only heard her use with enemies. To the incompleat. "You <em>thought</em>?"</p>

<p>The word barks through the hall, breaking the serenity like a glass window. It claws at the center of you. In the face of certainty, there is no need for thought. You know this. You don't need to hear the things she is saying to you.</p>

<p>"Get rid of it, it is a—"</p>

<p>"Vishgraz." A voice says the name. After a moment, you realize it must be yours. No one else knows it.</p>

<p>"What?" The word cracks over you like a blow.</p>

<p>"His name." You are about to drop through the floor. Never have you felt anything like this choking guilt. You've never done anything to merit it. A thing that follows orders is a thing that can never disappoint. "His name is Vishgraz."</p>

<p>Atraxa doesn't respond for such a long time that you think she's left. You look up. She's still here, but she isn't looking at you. "Get rid of it," she bites out.</p>

<p>She leaves you kneeling on the floor, staring up at an empty throne.</p>

<p>Beside you, a familiar voice begins to laugh. A light, musical chuckle. It suits this bright place, but it scrapes at your insides.</p>

<p>"Did you expect anything different?"</p>

<p>For the first time since you dropped your eyes in the face of your commander, you look at him.</p>

<p>That face, once enraging, now fills you with a mysterious fondness. It's unrecognizable, covered by the hard plating of compleation, but you know what lurks beneath it. The traitor's head you held in your hands. Arachnid legs sprout from a bulbous body, made powerful with silver and green plating. The piercing green of his eyes hold none of their previous owner's liveliness, and none of the anguish.</p>

<p>Two of those limbs were once delicate wings of white and red bone. The place where you took it from your own back still flares with a hot ache.</p>

<p>"What are you talking about?" Your voice comes out harsh.</p>

<p>Vishgraz offers you a hand with a slightly ironic flourish. You let him pull you to your feet.</p>

<p>"You think they will thank you for making something like me?"</p>

<p>"She made something like <em>me</em>," you insist, even as you know how little this means. What is a claim of hypocrisy in the face of the Machine Orthodoxy? Elesh Norn decides what is true, and Atraxa speaks with her voice.</p>

<p>"I wanted—" You don't finish. That's the crux—you feel it before it leaves your teeth. You <em>wanted</em>, and in wanting, you failed.</p>

<p>You meant to say you wanted to save them, to give them what you have, what <em>everyone </em>will soon have—to lay Geth's foolishness low and raise Belaxis's nervous attentiveness, but<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> that would be a lie, at least in part.</p>

<p>You hated Geth, the things he said clanging in your head like discordant bells. You liked Belaxis, or you liked the elegant lines of his incompleat flesh, the way the light glinted off his bright eyes and pale body.</p>

<p>You don't know why. You just didn't want either of them to disappear. You wanted to bring them with you. You are a wretched creature.</p>

<p>"I wanted to save you," is all you say aloud.</p>

<p>When Vishgraz responds with that same musical laugh, you both expect it and can't stand it. You jerk away from him. "Silence!"</p>

<p>"Save me?"</p>

<p>You raise a hand. "I told you, be quiet!" He doesn't wince, doesn't try to stop you. This is what stays your hand. It's not like you could do him any real damage, not anymore.</p>

<p>"Saved?" He steps in closer to you, limbs clicking, eyes gleaming. "Inside me, I can feel this body aching to tear itself apart. I feel the disparate parts of all the things that I used to be."</p>

<p>He looms over you, body so huge he blots out the light. He could crush you if he tried.</p>

<p>"I don't remember what I used to be," you say. You lean against him in a parody of an embrace. You shiver. It feels like you have been run through, like Belaxis on the spike.</p>

<p>You turn from him, swiftly. "Come with me."</p>

<p>Vishgraz is quiet for a moment. "Where are we going?"</p>

<p>You look back. "To get rid of you."</p>

<hr />

<p>The Dross Pits stink. You stand beneath the same shaft and look up, through the swirling mist of necrogen. The same spot, but you feel miles away. It is not the plane that has changed.</p>

<p>Beside you, Vishgraz makes a questioning noise, like he is expecting a blow.</p>

<p>"Go," you say.</p>

<p>Nothing.</p>

<p>"Go!"</p>

<p>A slow exhalation of breath. "You should come with me."</p>

<p>That makes you look up. You laugh. "No."</p>

<p>Vishgraz takes an unsteady step toward you. "You know, Ixhel. I know that you do. They claim to read the stars, to know that the Multiverse is meant to come under Phyrexian rule. The harmony of compleation will spread and spread and that is good and right." Another step. "But you know all of that is ashes. You, your people, everything you have set yourselves to do—all of it exists at the whim of a tyrant."</p>

<p>You should deny it.</p>

<p>You say nothing.</p>

<p>"Your Machine Orthodoxy means as much as my contracts."</p>

<p>"You aren't him," you growl.</p>

<p>"Then what am I?"</p>

<p>You stare at the fractured ground. "You are my first defiance. Now go."</p>

<p>He is silent for a long time, and when he does respond, it is with nothing but the quiet creak of his limbs, the ones you gave him.</p>

<p>You stand at the base of the shaft long after he has vanished into the dark. Deep in the center of you is an ache that wishes to follow him.</p>

<p>But you don't.</p>

Mentally, she noted whose shields were chipped or dimmed and whose swords were pitted or cracked. As she did, she took stock of her allies, too: which of them limped, which of them could no longer favor their dominant arm, whose breath rattled wetly as they walked through the wasteland on the edges of the Quiet Furnace.</p>

</div>

<p>Saheena, an old Vulshok woman, back straight despite age, walked with a stiff pride, a son at each shoulder. She had only one eye now due to a recent skirmish. Dried blood still dappled her throat. Elham, the Auriok woman who had led before Neyali, stomped behind them with more bags than she needed to bear, freeing her comrades to move unencumbered. They had so little resources and what they had, regardless of its form, was shared without reservation. Neyali vowed to herself that she'd do her best to find them what respite she could.</p>

<p>It wasn't long ago when she'd been alone, wandering the ruins of Mirrex with her firebird Otharri, looking for some sign—<em>any</em> sign, no matter how small or improbable—that there were others who had survived the Phyrexian massacre of her village. Now, people depended on her. <em>Trusted</em> her. Neyali wondered if the honor would ever stop feeling so heavy.</p>

<p>She was startled from her brooding by Otharri's clarion scream.</p>

<p>At the firebird's screech, Neyali's cellmates closed ranks, a perfect synchronous motion, tensing immediately for an ambush. None came. There was no sign of encroaching Phyrexians, no telltale scratch of skitterling claws on stone, no moan of steam from a Goliath. Nothing at all.</p>

<p>But Otharri wouldn't have risked giving away their location if it wasn't important. Pulse hammering in her throat, Neyali looked over her people again, desperate to understand what she had missed.</p>

<p>It hit her then.</p>

<p>"Reyana," whispered Neyali.</p>

<p>Neyali launched into motion before any of her cohorts could answer, racing back down the red-lit corridor, Otharri in pursuit overhead. Reyana had taken the role of rear guard as she always did, but she wasn't there. Neyali ran through the possibilities in her head. Had Reyana been jumped by one of the scrapchiefs? If she had, the rest of them should have been enveloped by Phyrexians. It made no sense that they'd have stopped at Reyana, never mind the fact that Urabrask, by all accounts, had insisted the Mirrans be left alone.</p>

<p>Hot steam gusted from the rightmost wall, revealing the presence of a narrow passage she'd missed before: a crack in the metal surface, barely large enough to fit a humanoid figure. Through the gap, Neyali saw a familiar silhouette. It was Reyana, inching backward toward a ledge, an ocean of magma burning orange below. In front of her, an imposing humanoid figure, its left arm transmuted into an oversized scythe, the gold of its original skin almost entirely obscured by iron pleats. It'd been a woman once, Auriok. On the ground, Reyana's weapons: forgotten, abandoned. In her face, an expression Neyali had never seen her childhood friend wear, a desperate hopelessness like her heart had broken irreparably.</p>

<p>"You are finally ready to be made perfect," said the aspirant in a woman's voice, low and halfway familiar. It reached for Reyana then, an arm outstretched: a strange tenderness in the gesture, and to Neyali's surprise, Reyana choked back a sob.</p>

<p>A less impulsive woman might have waited for reinforcement or at the very least, a better understanding of the circumstances. But for better or worse, Neyali was a creature of instinct, as much flame as her firebirds. So forward, she went, hands balled into fists. Her gauntlets shone in that scorching light. She bellowed a challenge, one echoed a heartbeat by Otharri a second later, the firebird rushing past Neyali in a tremor of glowing wings. He tore at the aspirant's face as it turned. The Phyrexian raised its bladed arm to cleave the phoenix in half, and Neyali ducked low and swung up, smashing into where the soft bones of a wrist should have resided.</p>

<p>Metal shattered and rained over her. The aspirant—an older Auriok woman, halfway familiar, no doubt tall when she'd been flesh, taller still after compleation—staggered but did not scream, only gazed back at Reyana.</p>

<p>"There will be no more fear when the soft flesh is made perfect."</p>

<p>Neyali did not slow. She gripped the aspirant by its ruined arm, torqued herself into position to ram an elbow into its chest, the whole of her weight thrown into the motion. She ran them both to the edge, letting go at the last second. The Phyrexian fell without so much as a cry.</p>

<p>"Neyali—"</p>

<p>"Are you alright?" Neyali rushed back to her friend and looked her over for injuries. One cut was all the Phyrexians needed. A single drip of glistening oil, and they'd have to race time to return to their encampment, find Reyana the healing she needed before phyresis became irreversible. "Were you contaminated? Did it have oil? Show me—"</p>

<p>"Neyali—"</p>

<p>The Vulshok woman clasped Reyana's head in her hands. "Your eyes. Let me see your eyes."</p>

<p>"I'm fine. I promise you." Reyana closed her hands over Neyali's own. And it was her friend again, not the husk she'd been before, animation returned to her broad expressive features. She smiled, exhausted but warmly. "She did nothing to me."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you fight back? What happened to your weapons?"</p>

<p>The light fled her face again.</p>

<p>"Neyali, she was my mother."</p>

<hr />

<p>The rookery glistened with the candle-glow light of resting firebirds, their flames dimmed as they crooned and murmured to one another, giving a blue-green cast to the moving shadows. It was a smaller space than Neyali would have wanted for them. Had she the luxury, she would have built them something sturdier, something designed to hold generations of firebirds. It wouldn't be so ramshackle, with platforms and nesting boxes cobbled from better things than scrap metal.</p>

<p>Neyali tickled Otharri under his feathered jaw.</p>

<p>"One day," she promised her friend. His mate slumbered beside him, their chicks nestled into her side. "We will build you a rookery on the cinders of Urabrask's Forge, and your chicks will grow up there, warm and happy, as will their chicks and the generation that follows theirs."</p>

<p>In answer, Otharri flapped his wings and pressed his cheek into Neyali's palm, his neck stretched, his manner pleased and indolent. Neyali scratched his plumage obligingly before turning to regard Reyana as the Auriok woman busied herself with her own birds. They'd been lucky. For all the recent chaos—more and more, there were stories of unrest among the priests, rumors that Urabrask was planning something titanic—that had befallen the resistance of late, the firebirds had had a good mating season. The females were all with clutches, a rarity. If even half the eggs survived, it would change so much.</p>

<p>"How are your charges?" said Neyali, picking her way past the dozing firebirds to Reyana's side.</p>

<p>"Childless," said Reyana, her tone flat.</p>

<p>She stepped aside then to reveal what her tall frame had been hiding: a nest of shattered eggs, oozing a phosphorescent yolk. It was a mercy that there were no traces of the lost chick, and that the mother was young enough to be indifferent to her offspring, more preoccupied with courting the attention of a neighboring male.</p>

<p>"What happened?" said Neyali, wincing. The last thing she wanted for her friend was another tragedy.</p>

<p>"Skitterlings, maybe," said Reyana, still with that hollow tone of voice as she sifted through the shards. "Wouldn't be surprised if it were rats. Regardless, it doesn't matter. The clutch is dead. Just like my mother."</p>

<p>Neyali swallowed. "If I had known—"</p>

<p>"You couldn't have. I didn't know. Not until she was there, asking me to join her."</p>

<p>"I could have asked you," said Neyali, unable to shake the certainty that she had failed horrifically and a terrible price would need to be paid. "I could have thought first before acting. We might have been able to save her. We might have been able to do <em>something</em>."</p>

<p>Her voice cracked at the last word.</p>

<p>"She wouldn't have been happy," said Reyana, making eye contact with Neyali. Her voice softened. "My mother—she was a timid woman. Glass rather than steel. Everything frightened her. Everything was a portent of death or worse. You could see it in her eyes: how much she wanted it all to just<em> stop</em>."</p>

<p>Reyana swallowed audibly.</p>

<p>"I used to wish she'd just die," said Reyana, with a terrible dignity. "Not because I was tired of her wailing, or even that I resented the fact she beat me. I wanted—"</p>

<p>Neyali gaped at her friend. "She <em>beat </em>you?"</p>

<p>"Not with any malice. I think it was because she needed an outlet. Some way to mitigate the enormous pressures she was facing. It needed <em>expression</em>, or she would have exploded."</p>

<p>"Still, it was cruel—"</p>

<p>"I loved her, you understand," said Reyana and Neyali heard a rebuke in those quietly spoken words. "I still do. Anyway, I thought it'd be easier for her to simply not exist in this world. I wanted her torment to end. Does that make me a bad daughter?"</p>

<p>"No," said Neyali, hands closing and reopening, like she could wring the right words from the air. "You're not. I understand completely. The Phyrexians have taken so much from us. It's why we fight. What befell your mother, we can make sure it won't happen to anyone else."</p>

<p>Reyana inhaled, her breath shivering. "What if Phyrexia is right?"</p>

<p>"Don't joke like that," said Neyali.</p>

<p>"I know we say what they've done is a sin, a violation of the soul. But you should have seen my mother, Neyali. She was calm. She has never been calm. I've never seen her enjoy a day of peace. Even in her sleep, she would mumble and weep and moan. The version that I met today—she was at rest. I think—"</p>

<p>Horror flowed through Neyali. She could see where the end of the sentence laid and the thought of it being spoken aloud, of Reyana giving breath to those words, made Neyali want to scream. For one guilty moment, she found herself wishing Reyana <em>had</em> been infected by glistening oil, so she could blame this terrifying perspective on Phyrexian corruption. Because the alternative was so much worse: this thought Reyana had arrived at such conclusions all on her own. "The peace," said Neyali very carefully, "that the Phyrexians feel is a false one. Born of a loss of self. That thing wasn't your mother. Not any longer. At best, it was a puppet. A lie made steel and flesh."</p>

<p>"Is that so?"</p>

<p>Neyali nodded.</p>

<p>"Each of their aspirants are a lure. Meant to entice, meant to convince those who remain that phyresis is the only logical option. They're there to break our hearts and spirits. And for whatever it's worth," her voice gentled, "I think you endured that encounter with more grace than I could have. Personally, I'd have gone mad with grief."</p>

<p>"Who says I haven't?"</p>

<p>Neyali clapped a hand around her friend's right shoulder. "If you have, know you'll have company as we go laughing in the dark. I made you a promise when we met. I won't abandon you. No matter what happens, I'll always be at your side."</p>

<p>Only later, as Neyali crawled into her cot, did she realize that Reyana had not spoken her half of their usual call and response, and fell asleep worrying about what that meant.</p>

<hr />

<p>Neyali woke the next morning to a young Vulshok boy—the oldest of Saheena's sons, he had her eyes and the build, Neyali was told, of a father long vanished—clearing his throat. She jerked upright into a sitting position, rubbing the heel of a palm into her right eye. Either age was catching up, or she was getting too comfortable with the idea that there were people she could trust. Neyali fervently hoped it was the former. Complacency meant death.</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>The wretchedness in the boy's expression grew. He handed her a note.</p>

<p>"It's Reyana," he said miserably. "She's gone."</p>

<hr />

<p>Gone, as it turned out, meant a note in her cot and her belongings untouched. It was as if she had simply chosen to walk away for a moment. None of their rations had been touched. Were it not for the note and were Neyali a more optimistic person, she might have chosen to believe Reyana was somewhere close. But Neyali knew enough of their world that she could not allow herself that illusion.</p>

<p>She turned the note over, hoping for clues.</p>

<p><em>Meet me at the Salvage Complex.</em></p>

<p>Why would Reyana go there?</p>

<p>Neyali wondered if it was a trap, if Reyana had been taken against her will then forced to write the note, enticing Neyali to her own capture. But for such a possibility to be true, there would need to have been more signs of conflict, some indication that Phyrexians had broken through the camp's defenses.</p>

<p>Neyali pushed down on the little voice that whispered, <em>maybe, she went willingly.</em></p>

<p>"The goblin rules there, doesn't he?" said Elham, the white of her hair made even more incandescent by the white-gold flecks in her skin.</p>

<p>"I think so," said Neyali, the note pocketed again. She restlessly checked her equipment: her armor for faults, her gloves for rust. Otharri watched from his perch. Neyali had seen Slobad once before, but only from afar: a monstrously large goblin, his limbs swollen with black steel.</p>

<p>"Is he a Furnace Boss?" asked Saheena's youngest. What was his <em>name</em>? To Neyali's shame, she could not remember it, not with the panic hammering at her ribs.</p>

<p>"No." said Elham. "He's waste disposal. Urabrask sends obsolete Phyrexians to him for repurposing."</p>

<p>Nothing went to waste in the Furnace Layer. What could not be used was reduced to components, taken apart and rebuilt so it could be of worth again.</p>

<p>"What would he want with Reyana then?" Neyali demanded in frustration.</p>

<p>"Labor?" said the Auriok woman. Saheena and her youngest came around the corner, the blood gone, her eye bandaged. "He can't run his complex alone."</p>

<p>Neyali nodded. Easier this than introspection. Simpler to name your adversary and then go straight into looking for a fight. She slammed her fist into her open palm, grinned toothily at her cellmates.</p>

<p>"Right," said Neyali. "I'm going to find Reyana. No one is obligated to join me on this mission. Reyana is my friend, and—"</p>

<p>"She is family to us, too," said Elham, slinging her battleax on her shoulder, her stance allowing no objection. Her calf shone with polished gold; a simple enough prosthetic, well-articulated and better made.</p>

<p>"I might be making a mistake."</p>

<p>"We've all lost someone," said Saheena, voice tightening. Her sons looked away, their expressions clouding. Everyone in the cell knew the story: they were the last remnants of a massive family, teeming with aunts and uncles. "If we're lucky, we can be sure that Reyana won't be in their number."</p>

<hr />

<p>The cell mobilized within an hour. Most headed eastward, bearing the main bulk of their supplies away to a neighboring camp, the firebirds in accompaniment. Only Otharri remained with Neyali, unwilling to be parted from his friend.</p>

<p>After stiff farewells, what remained of Neyali's cell, whittled to the bravest and most stubborn, set off in the direction of the Salvage Complex. The route there was not as treacherous as some: the tunnels leading to the compound were far from the main arteries of the Furnace Layer, wrapping around its very edges. Though it didn't intersect with any of the forges, the road was long. and that alone brought risks of unwanted encounters.</p>

<p>But none materialized.</p>

<p>The road stayed empty, and unnervingly so.</p>

<p>Almost as if the way had been cleared on purpose. Like something waited for them. Their nerve might had broken if not for the Mirran encampments they found enroute: one nestled in what might have once been the ruins of a factory, or the disemboweled belly of an overgrown Goliath, twisted spires of black steel rising like broken ribs; one at the back of a mezzanine teeming with unused assembly lines; the last in a graveyard of bizarre crumbling structures. In each camp, Neyali and her crew learned the same thing: that loved ones had gone missing, with no signs that they'd been taken by force.</p>

<p><em>She went willingly</em>, insisted that little voice again, which Neyali found growingly difficult to ignore, but before she could reconsider her loyalties, they arrived at the outcropping above the Salvage Complex.</p>

<p>Once, it might have been a prison compound. Deformed cages rose in unsteady towers, the bars mangled, bulging in places, as if whatever had been inside was desperate to escape. Many were occupied by slumped figures: captured Mirrans, waiting their anointment with glistening oil. Machinery snaked in between the enclosures, coiling over them in a parody of vegetal life. What had Neyali's attention was the pit at the very center of the Salvage Complex, an inverted ziggurat veined with enormous black pipes. Each level teemed with impossible contraptions, moving parts whose purpose Neyali couldn't decipher.</p>

<p>And bodies, she realized.</p>

<p>Countless Phyrexian bodies, made to kneel before they were husked of their metal, the flesh left behind. There were rows upon rows of them, like a silent audience staring down at the platform at the very base. A single figure occupied the narrow wedge of metal. Neyali felt her heart jump: it was Reyana, shackled and prone.</p>

<p>"Watch the skies for me, beloved," whispered Neyali, pressing a kiss to Otharri's cheek. With a twitch of her arm, she sent the firebird in the air. Neyali turned her attention then to her comrades. "There's every chance in the world that this is a trap and I am a fool, but Reyana is my friend. I promised us I would not abandon her. I intend to keep that promise. But none of you made the same foolish vow. There will be no judgment, no censure if you choose to leave. If you walk away now, you walk away with honor."</p>

<p>The gathered Mirrans exchanged looks, but no one spoke until Saheena at last said in a bored voice:</p>

<p>"Do you want to waste time or should we begin checking the perimeter?"</p>

<hr />

<p>They made three full circuits of the Salvage Complex before Neyali gave up. For all intents and purposes, the location was unguarded. Their air-purity detector revealed no telltale increase in toxic particles: the usual sign of hidden Phyrexians. It was empty, save for Reyana and that assembly of corpses.</p>

<p>"What now?" said Elham after they returned to their original vantage point.</p>

<p>She stared down at where Reyana was, distraught. <em>I don't know</em>, Neyali wanted to say, only she could not. They were relying on her. <em>Elham </em>was looking to her, waiting for her orders. The woman had been a hero, a mentor, and she had trusted Neyali to take over when she stepped down.</p>

<p>Neyali swallowed hard.</p>

<p>"I'm going down on my own."</p>

<p>That startled Elham. "It's reckless."</p>

<p>"It's strategic," Neyali countered. "If we missed something, if this really is a trap, the focus will be on me, giving the rest of you time to retaliate."</p>

<p>"What if it turns out that we're outnumbered?"</p>

<p>"Then you run."</p>

<p>"<em>Neyali</em>—"</p>

<p>"You have my orders," said Neyali, hoping they would only hear her authority, not the tremble in her voice. She knew what her bravado might mean. Compleation. Often Neyali wondered how much of the original remained after phyresis had set in. If enough of a mind remained to scream endlessly at what the body was made to do.</p>

<p>If she would scream, too.</p>

<p>"An honor guard," snarled Saheena, coming up from her right, stubborn as iron.</p>

<p>"Fine." Neyali snapped. "Three of you. With me. The rest of you. To your stations."</p>

<p>The Mirrans saluted her, dispersing save for the Vulshok matriarch and her two sons, who looked so agonizingly young in the wash of red light. In tight formation, they followed her down to the pit: Saheena serving as vanguard, her sons flanking Neyali.</p>

<p>Much like their journey to the Salvage Complex, their expedition to Reyana was without incident. The dead Phyrexians remained inert, statue-like, for all that Neyali was certain that at any minute, they would leap at the four of them, a howling mass of maimed flesh. Nothing came.</p>

<p>They stepped onto the platform. It swayed under their weight, though not enough to raise concern. Reyana did not respond. She laid there instead, faced away, her breathing shallow and irregular.</p>

<p>"Reyana," whispered Neyali, coming to her knees beside her friend.</p>

<p>With care, she turned Reyana over onto her back. The Auriok, despite her stillness, was awake: eyes open, fixed on nothing, expression clouded with the same misery Neyali had seen that night before her friend walked away into the dark.</p>

<p>"Reyana," said Neyali again, like her friend's name was a spell. "It's me. We're going to get you out of this."</p>

<p>The Auriok woman blinked once, lashes long and black as oil. Her gaze focused. The agony in her expression strengthened. "I'm sorry, Neyali. I was just so exhausted."</p>

</div>

<p>Neyali shook her head.</p>

<p>"Nothing to be forgiven. We're <em>family</em>—" said Neyali, the first time she had ever put the sentiment to words, her voice thick with emotion. Her attention was riveted by the chains knotted around Reyana's wrists and arms: they were of unusual design, sleeker than what the Phyrexians often used, less like oxidized sinew, more beautiful. "And family stays together."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," Reyana said again in lieu of an answer, her fingers brushing Neyali's, running up her forearms: something contemplative in the movements, as though she was evaluating her friend or more precisely, a decision she represented. "I truly am."</p>

<p>The air quickened. A sheen of red-orange light traveled up Reyana's arms, over her restraints, up and across Neyali's knuckles. The latter jerked backward, instinctive. A split second later, the light darkened and corporealized into a knot of chains, landing on the platform with a thunk. Reyana, no longer bound, sat up placidly, blinking at her cellmates like they were strangers.</p>

<p>"I knew it," snarled the matriarch. "<em>Traitor</em>."</p>

<p>"What did they promise you, Reyana?" Neyali bayed, furious that her fears—that little voice, the one that had whispered time and again, <em>she went willingly</em>—were proven right. Neyali scanned her surroundings. Too late for them to run, but the four of them could still buy the rest of their cell time. She just had to give the signal, make sure the rest knew to eschew last-minute heroics. Her gaze rose to the smoke-choked sky; Otharri was nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p>Had he been caught?</p>

<p>No. Impossible. The only way Phyrexia would have Otharri was as a corpse, and that wasn't going to happen without a fight that'd echo through the Furnace Layer. There was a reason the Mirrans saw phoenixes as a symbol of hope, and the Phyrexians saw phoenixes as an omen of death. He was there somewhere in the smog, Neyali was sure. <em>Go far</em>, she willed the firebird. <em>Run. Lead the others to safety. Don't let them get you.</em></p>

<p>"Peace!" shrieked Reyana, tottering onto her feet. She wept as she spoke, each word sobbed. "We're not all like you. I don't want to die afraid, Neyali. I don't want a life like my mother's. I want it to stop. Don't you understand? I want this to end. I want the perfect peace that my mother was given. Slobad—he promised me that there will be peace. That I will be reunited with the people I love and long for and miss."</p>

<p>"And you will be," came a new voice from behind Neyali, a voice surprisingly normal given its origins.</p>

<p>She whirled around to see Slobad on the edge of the pit. Neyali had seen him once before, but only from afar, and thought little of him then: just another Phyrexian horror in an army of millions. Now, she was close enough to wince at the full truth of him. His small, goblin form was embedded in a massive construct of cables and sheafs of metal plating, one shoulder bearing an epaulet adorned with a triptych of shrieking goblin heads, and Neyali could <em>see</em> where Slobad's limbs had been shorn off, where they'd been amputated at the joint and soldered to the exoskeleton of his golem-like Phyrexian body.</p>

<p>"We're not your enemy," he said. "Out there, the world is hard and cold and it takes everything. Friends, family. But here? We're safe. We're family. We have all the people who we love, huh?"</p>

<p>Slobad looked down at his massive hand and then at the quartet.</p>

<p>"You're Neyali."</p>

<p>Her companions took position, weapons at the ready. <em>Death before compleation</em>, Neyali thought. "I have no fear of you."</p>

<p>"Why should you? Nothing cruel here, huh? We don't want to hurt any of you. We just want you to be reunited with the ones you loved," said Slobad softly. "The Mirrans look to you for leadership. Will you not guide them home to those who love them?"</p>

<p>"Father?" whimpered one of the younger Vulshok, his spear clattering from his hands.</p>

<p>An aspirant stood beside Slobad: a Vulshok man, antlered, almost entirely robed in steel.</p>

<p>"Stay focused," she warned her allies. "Don't falter."</p>

<p>"I offer you a choice. You four," said Slobad. "For the rest of the Mirrans in hiding."</p>

<p>Neyali felt her heart sink.</p>

<p>Slobad <em>knew</em>.</p>

<p>"We're with you, no matter what you decide," said Saheena quietly. "Tell us to die with you, and we shall. To the end, Neyali." There was a hairline crack in her voice's calm, and Neyali wondered if she had vowed those same words to the partner she thought dead, who stood there now above them, or at least, the shell of him. "We're with you to the end."</p>

<p>Neyali looked back to where Reyana was. She was on her knees, hands twisted together in prayer, rocking in place. She was weeping: tears, not oil, and it was so much worse than if Reyana had been corrupted. Knowing Reyana had <em>chosen </em>this. Knowing she had elected to be bait.</p>

<p>Neyali, the damn fool that she was, had walked straight into the trap, even though every instinct had begged her to do otherwise. But she could salvage this.</p>

<p>"Why should we trust you?" said Neyali. "How do I know you won't take all of us, anyway? Urabrask gave his orders. Aren't you supposed to have better things to do than harm us?"</p>

<p>"Harm? Why would I harm you, huh? I don't want to. I only want to help you."</p>

<p>Neyali swallowed hard, glancing at those she had led to ruin.</p>

<p>"Let these three go then, if you believe that."</p>

<p>"Done."</p>

<p>"Neyali—"</p>

<p>"<em>Go</em>." said Neyali. "Before he changes his mind."</p>

<p>She could feel the Vulshok elder tense, her sons tremble: a whimper bitten back by one, a hiss of frustration swallowed by the other. Then, Saheena nodded, almost imperceptibly. The three filed past Neyali. True to his word, Slobad and his minions did nothing, only watched with their foundry-bright eyes.</p>

<hr />

<p>It was a mercy on Slobad's part, Neyali decided, that she was placed in a cage far above where Reyana would accept the glistening oil. From this vantage, Neyali could almost pretend her friend was a stranger, a traitor whom she shared no ties with. <em>At least the rest of the cell is safe</em>, Neyali thought to herself, holding to the words like a lifeline. <em>At least Otharri is safe.</em></p>

<p>She would hold onto that for as long as she could. With luck, when the time came, it'd be what slowed her enough for a resistance fighter to cut her down.</p>

<p>To Neyali's surprise, it was not a priest who came to begin Reyana's transformation but Slobad himself. There was a tenderness in how the goblin bade Neyali's friend to go to her knees, a grace in how she sank down, the bronze circle of her face raised as though to receive a blessing.</p>

<p>Neyali averted her eyes, unable to bear the sight.</p>

<p><em>At least the rest of the cell is safe</em>, Neyali said to herself again. <em>At least Otharri is safe.</em></p>

<p>She heard a gentle click then: talons coming to rest on the bars above her head. The firebird trilled a series of low notes in greeting, beak nudged through the slats.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here?" whispered Neyali, trying and failing to keep the relief from her voice. "You have to go."</p>

<p>The firebird fixed one incredulous eye on her and inhaled.</p>

<p>"I am one person. It's not worth it. You—"</p>

<p>Neyali laughed deliriously, unable to stop herself, struck by her own hypocrisy. All this happened because of one person. She had given everything to save Reyana, believing that yes, that one life could be that important.</p>

<p>Otharri breathed out.</p>

<p>The sulfurous air went from filthy orange to an incandescent white-blue as the firebird's flames incinerated the bars. Ash, still limned in gold, flaked away in the breeze. He dove away to the next cage, doing the same over and over, while an alarm rose through the Salvage Complex. Otharri sang a defiant call to arms.</p>

<p>And Neyali answered with a glad cry of her own.</p>

<p>"This—" she boomed. Magic leaped from her to each Mirran Otharri freed, a slick of fire that clung to their skin. Neyali looked down to where Slobad waited, his sledgehammer in hand. "Is not where we die."</p>

<p>If they moved quickly enough across the towering structures, there would be no chance that the Phyrexians would catch up. What few were crawling up the cages were kept at bay by Otharri's fire. Neyali searched for Reyana amid the chaos and found her behind, looking up at the clamor. Despite everything, she still reached out a hand, a final attempt.</p>

<p>Reyana turned away.</p>

<p>That was that then. Neyali swallowed. What she would have given for time to argue with Reyana, time to insist there was no reason to surrender, that Reyana had to fight. But they'd each made their decisions. Their paths were now separate. Neyali saluted her once friend. In the distance, she could see her cell—not just those who had chosen to follow Neyali on this quixotic mission, but all of them—charging into the Salvage Complex to clear a path for their escape. Later, she would have time to grieve.</p>

<p>Now, she had to lead her people away.</p>

The space was airy and infinite, filled with shafts of buttery, obscenely golden light untainted by the horrors it had filtered through. Try as she might, Kaya couldn't even guess at the light's origin; there was no sun so far below the surface of what had been Mirrodin, no obvious source of the illumination, but still the halls and rooms around them shone, the air glittering with the dissonant harmony of the unseen Phyrexian choirs.</p>

<div class="figure-wrapper">

<p>Jace didn't look good. He was moving under his own power, but the wires growing through his flesh and bone were starting to break the skin, piercing through it and weaving themselves together in delicate loops, waving like cilia, even as they formed a shell around his arm. He had shifted the bag containing the sylex to the other side of his body, resting it against his hip as they hurried.</p>

<p>Kaya thought the worst sign was the fact that he was letting them see how far gone he was, rather than casting a soothing illusion over himself. He was like a cat that way; Jace never wanted anyone to see when he was hurt, preferring to mask the damage and present himself as perfectly fine. And now, he was walking wounded.</p>

<p>But then, they all were, in their own ways. Kaito walked with quick, efficient steps, his attention split between their surroundings and the hexgold-gilded drone on his shoulder, which made cooing noises and rubbed against his cheek, clearly trying to soothe the anxious Planeswalker. Kaya might have cracked a joke about needing a teddy bear to cope with the stress of battle, but honestly, she wished she'd brought a friend with her. Even a small one who couldn't speak.</p>

<p>Of course, she <em>had</em> brought friends with her. She'd come with Tyvar, Vraska, and the others. And now here she was, moving through enemy territory with a stranger and a dead man, to help detonate a bomb that could murder countless strangers. The Phyrexian threat was very real, and worse than she had feared.</p>

<p>Even still, there were people like Melira, who held hope in their hearts and blades in their hands, who were unwilling to surrender the fight. The deaths had been unfathomable. The cost to the people of Mirrodin had already been more than could ever have been fairly repaid. They deserved so much better. Kaya knew, without question, that the Multiverse had no glorious architect, no kindly divinity making sweeping decisions about how things would play out, because no architect with a hint of kindness in their heart would have done such a thing to the innocents of Mirrodin. Even if someone were to argue that Phyrexia had as much right to exist as the rest of them, the fact was that the machine contagion was parasitic at best, predatory at worst. A Multiverse which contained Phyrexia would inevitably <em>become</em> Phyrexia, consumed by their terrible One. Only one version of reality could survive this conflict.</p>

<p>She knew which one she wanted it to be.</p>

<p>The sounds of battle faded behind them. Kaya was direly afraid the three of them were all that remained. Realmbreaker—out of respect for Tyvar, she couldn't even think of it as a World Tree—was compleated. Their friends were dead. There hadn't been any time to mourn, and the time they had left was so short that she wasn't sure there ever would be. If she died here, would she be mourned? Would any of them?</p>

<p>"I hate this place," said Kaito, voice low as he shattered the harmonic semi-silence. Kaya glanced at him, almost surprised. Jace didn't. He kept looking straight ahead, clearly forcing himself to keep going through what must have been unspeakable agonies.</p>

<p>"It's not right," said Kaito, looking directly at Kaya. "I'm not particularly sensitive to spirits, but Boseiju, the great tree in Kamigawa, exists in harmony with everything around it. It's filled with kami, with spirits. Everything in Kamigawa is. This place<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> the spirits must have been consumed along with everything else, or they would be screaming without end. I don't think you'd have to be sensitive to pick up on that."</p>

<p>"No," Kaya admitted. The spirits Kaito talked about didn't sound like the sort of spirits she was used to dealing with, who were born from death, not naturally born immortals. With as much death as this plane had seen, she would have expected the air to be so thick with ghosts that it became hard to breathe, but there was nothing. She couldn't call any aspect of Phyrexia sterile, not when even the dust was designed to infect and consume the unwary. And yet "sterile" was the only word that came to mind when trying to describe the spirits of this place. Phyrexia didn't release its victims, not even in death.</p>

<p>The halls around them were empty, which felt less like a stroke of luck and more like one more inescapable piece of the massive trap that this entire mission had become. Kaya took a breath. Jace hadn't turned yet. They still had the sylex. All was not yet lost. They moved in helpless hope—a helplessness that had only grown stronger since leaving Elspeth behind. Something about the other Planeswalker made it easy to believe the impossible might be possible after all.</p>

<p>That was gone now, along with Elspeth herself, and even if they won the day after this, they would still have paid far too dearly for their victory. Nothing was going to wipe clean the damage that had been done by Phyrexia.</p>

<p>Nothing.</p>

<p>The ceiling above them gave way to clear panels, like the wings of some great slumbering fly, translucent and organic and—like so much else in this terrible place—oddly, vitally alive, split by slightly darker veins that pulsed with glistening oil. Damaging the "skylight" would shower them in infection. Through the panels, they could see bridges of red sinew leading to the great invasion ships, endless ranks of Phyrexian warriors in the red and white of Elesh Norn's faction filing into the increasingly gravid holds of the waiting vessels. They were pregnant with Phyrexia, ready to spread this terrible seed throughout the Multiverse.</p>

<p>Red mist drifted down from the ships as they prepared for launch, adding a bloody cast to the skylights. The clear membrane absorbed the red particulates, cleansing itself every few seconds only to be smeared once again, an endless cycle of recovery and besmirchment. Kaya shuddered.</p>

<p>"This is a dead end," muttered Jace, darkly. "We're going to have to go back and try another direction."</p>

<p>Voice soft, Kaito said, "I don't think so. Kaya, Jace—over here."</p>

<p>They moved toward the lithe ninja, joining him around a hole in the floor. It looked like it was meant to be the entrance to a stairway, only someone had forgotten to construct the stairs. Instead, a roughly ten-foot drop led to a hovering disk of polished white metal, distinguished from the floor on which they stood by the absence of walls around it.</p>

<p>The hole was echoed by a larger hole in the disk below, exposing Realmbreaker's trunk as it vanished into mist marbled with lightning. This was as close as they were going to come to the core root of the tree.</p>

<p>"This is a plane designed for falling through," said Kaya, trying to make it sound light, as she phased herself intangible and dropped to the disc below.</p>

<p>The smell of ozone, mycosynth, and what seemed like a horrible perversion of sweet Kaldheim air addressed her nose as soon as she landed, and she shuddered again, moving to position herself beneath the hole.</p>

<p>"Come on," she said, positioning herself to catch Jace when he dropped through. "Let's get this done."</p>

<p>Kaito eased Jace into a sitting position at the edge of the hole. The exhausted telepath slumped, still clutching the sylex, legs dangling like a child preparing to jump off a swing. When he finally pushed off the edge, Kaito stabilizing him the whole time, Kaya had a brief, shameful flash of wanting to step out of the way and just let him fall. He was already lost; she was inviting a monster into a bolt hole from which where was no escaping. But she held her place, and when he fell into her arms, she managed not to cringe away from the wires on his arms.</p>

<p>She couldn't stop herself from phasing as they nuzzled at her flesh, already carrying the Phyrexian need to spread the infection, and Jace looked at her with understanding, even as he stumbled to catch his balance.</p>

<p><em>"It's almost over,"</em> he said, voice echoing inside her head without passing through her ears.</p>

<p>Privately, Kaya doubted that, and to Jace's credit, he allowed her to have her doubts without commenting on them. He moved to unpack the sylex, revealing it to the Phyrexian air for the first time. Kaya took a step back. Kaito, who had dropped down unnoticed by either one of them, took a step forward, stopping only when Kaya grabbed his arm.</p>

<p>"Let him have his space," she said. "This is delicate."</p>

<p>"Are you sure it's safe for us to be this close?" asked Kaito.</p>

<p>"Urza detonated the first one in his lap, and he lived," said Kaya. "We'll be fine. Probably." Assuming the plane survived.</p>

<p>Assuming the shockwave traveling up the tree didn't rip New Phyrexia apart from core to crust. It might still send the last of the Mirrans to oblivion, and all the Planeswalkers still on this plane with them. If Nahiri survived her fall and was clinging to who she had always been, she would be blotted out in an instant by the blast. So would Elspeth, and Tyvar, and all the others, even—</p>

<p>Kaya couldn't even form the shape of her own name in her thoughts. She had spent years dancing among the ghosts. If she died here, she wouldn't be leaving a ghost of her own behind.</p>

<p>"Wait," she said, as Jace moved to settle cross-legged next to the sylex, placing his hands on the rim. The wires spidering from his arm recoiled from the metal, almost as if they recognized it for the looming disaster it was.</p>

<p>Jace glanced up at her, eyebrows raised in mild surprise.</p>

<p>"Are you sure we should do this?" Kaya asked. "The Invasion Tree has connected. 'Wipe it all clean'—that's what the sylex says, right? The carvings? When you set it off, the blast will travel along the branches. It could damage or even destroy every plane it's currently in contact with. And we have no way of knowing which planes they are. Vryn, Tolvada, Ixalan—even Ravnica, they could all be casualties."</p>

<p>"If Phyrexia has reached them, they already are," said Jace.</p>

<p>"Hold on," said Kaito. "I came here to save Kamigawa, not to destroy it."</p>

<p>"The sylex obliterates everything it touches," said Kaya. "Even <em>time</em> was fractured when Urza used the original. There was a chance Mirrodin would survive before the tree was compleated—and the explosion would have been contained to this plane. Now, if it can travel through those Omenpaths that Tyvar saw forming in the branches<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> Jace, we could destroy <em>everything</em>. We could blow up the Blind Eternities. You have to wait."</p>

<p>"Vraska is dead, and I am dying," said Jace calmly. "My body may continue and turn the powers it contains against any of you who still live—and I would kill me before that can happen, if I were you. You have no idea how much time and energy I spend <em>not</em> destroying the minds around me just because I can, or how hard I've worked to find a way to move in a Multiverse of such simplicity without doing endless damage. I will be an incredible weapon for Phyrexian dominance." His eyes flashed with an inhuman blue glow, brighter than his norm, and he grimaced, visibly composing himself. "They're starting to speak through me, Kaya, we're out of <em>time</em>. Every moment we wait, every second we spend dithering over your sudden need to be the hero, not just the savior, means another plane is potentially lost. We're destroying nothing. We're preventing greater deaths. Blame Phyrexia, not us."</p>

<p>He sighed heavily, looking suddenly exhausted. "And there is no other way. Better to fulfill the promise of the sylex and scorch the branches, sweep it all away, than to lose the entire Multiverse. Bring the ending. Topple the empires to bring a fresh start. Renew it all."</p>

<p>He began to lift the sylex into his lap.</p>

<p>Kaya moved instantly, lunging forward and grabbing his wrist before he could complete the motion. He pulled his hand out of her grasp and away from the sylex, eyes narrowing.</p>

<p>She pulled a dagger from her belt. Jace's eyes began to glow. Neither of them said a word. Kaito looked between them, briefly confused, before pulling his sword and falling into position beside Kaya.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Jace, but I can't let you risk Kamigawa," he said.</p>

<p>"Very well then," said Jace, and slowly, laboriously, rose.</p>

<hr />

<p>On the bridge over the void, Ajani's axe clashed against the blade of Elspeth's sword, pushing the smaller Planeswalker back even as she dug her heels into the sinewy surface and tried to stand her ground.</p>

<p>"You can't defeat me, young one," said Ajani, voice unnaturally calm and level. He spoke to her like she was a child who had tried to steal one too many sweets, who needed to be talked out of some unhealthy desire. His tone carried only affection and genuine concern under the calm, and if he had sounded any less like himself, Elspeth might have been able to bring her blade around and undercut his ankles, sending him toppling into the depths. "It's useless to try. Join us. We are the inevitable. We are the ideal. We are One, and once you come to be One with us, we'll be stronger in a way you could never have dreamt while you lived in flawed, imperfect flesh."</p>

<p>"Never," managed Elspeth, her defiance sounding weak to her own ears. "Ajani, if you can hear me, I'm sorry."</p>

<p>"You have nothing to apologize for," said Ajani, pushing harder against her sword, trying to move into her space. He had yet to swing at her, allowing all the attacks to come from her<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> but now she couldn't disengage without opening herself too widely. Even defense could be a trap.</p>

<p>"So stop <em>fighting</em> us!"</p>

<p>"Phyrexia is no one's enemy," said Ajani. "We only want to bring you the peace and perfection of becoming One. We only wanted to bring you home."</p>

<p>"Then you're everyone's enemy," said Elspeth.</p>

<p>"So be it," said Ajani. "You do not need to be alive to join Phyrexia."</p>

<p>Ajani finally attacked, swinging his axe in a brutal arc accompanied by a blast of destructive magical force that narrowly missed Elspeth's head, digging a chunk out of the bridge behind her. She spun around, slashing at his knees, only for him to leap nimbly out of the way, moving with a speed that made her breath catch in her throat. The battle had already been joined. Now, it began in earnest.</p>

<hr />

<p>Not far from Elspeth and Ajani, Tyvar used his blades to keep the twin barbs of Tibalt's tails at bay, holding the almost bestial Planeswalker as far back as he could. Tyvar's skin was still metallic and gleaming, his entire body having converted into Glimmervoid metal for the sliver of protection it could offer him against the glistening oil that dripped like venom from Tibalt's body.</p>

<p>"Little prince," hissed Tibalt, a vicious smile on his distorted face. "Little pretender, little would-be hero, there will be no sagas in your name. If your legend survives this day, it will be a tale of failure. The saga of a man chosen by a greatness he could never have been worthy of. How does it feel to be the last prince of Kaldheim?"</p>

<p>"You're not the God of Lies," snarled Tyvar, bringing up his arm to block one of Tibalt's tails. "Even so, nothing you say can be trusted."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not, but you're too stupid to understand when you should be afraid," said Tibalt, whipping one tail away from Tyvar's hold and stabbing it toward the other man, barb glancing off the metal of Tyvar's shoulder.</p>

<p>Tyvar hissed in pain, and Tibalt hissed in pleasure, the two men united for the first and perhaps only time in their acquaintance.</p>

<p>"Pain, yes," said Tibalt, with great satisfaction. "<em>You</em> may be resistant to my charms, but that's only because your head is too empty to understand when you should doubt your convictions. Not everyone is so devoid of concern."</p>

<p>He looked away from Tyvar, the ultimate insult in the middle of a battle, and directed a terrible, thin-lipped smile at Elspeth as she struggled against her former mentor.</p>

<p>"Doubt," said Tibalt, oily smoke beginning to leak out the corners of his mouth. "The greatest weapon of them all."</p>

<hr />

<p>Elspeth staggered as she blocked Ajani's latest blow, barely keeping her footing. A wave of misery and doubt washed over her. This was her fault. Ajani wouldn't have been infected if she'd been paying closer attention, if she'd been a better student, if she'd been less distracted by her own problems, if she'd been strong enough to save Mirrodin in the first place, rather than allowing it to fall to Phyrexia. If she'd been a better person, none of this would have happened.</p>

<p>If she had only fought her way down to the Furnace Layer faster, they would have reached the tree before it could connect, found Vraska before she could be compleated, saved so many others, saved them all. This was all down to her.</p>

<p>Ajani's next blow knocked the weapon from her hands, and Elspeth backed away, palms out, trying to ward him off. She couldn't even beg, not with the misery weighing her down.</p>

<p>Tibalt laughed, stabbing again and again at Tyvar, who staggered under the blows, horrified by the sight of Elspeth in retreat. Seeing her losing her faith in the fight<nbsp> . . .</nbsp></p>

<p>It felt as if all hope was lost.</p>

<hr />

<p>Kaya lunged for Jace, or rather, for the space where Jace <em>should</em> have been, and stumbled through the empty air of the telepath's projected image, the false Jace splitting like fog and dissipating.</p>

<p>"Kaya, please," he said. "We're Planeswalkers. That means we owe a debt to something greater than ourselves, even when it isn't convenient, or ideal. We came here to save the Multiverse. Detonating the sylex might destroy a dozen planes. It might also just shake them a little. Either way, the <em>rest will live</em>."</p>

<p>"The Multiverse isn't <em>dying</em>, you heartless—" Kaya caught herself, taking a deep breath. The Jace she had always known was meticulous about the privacy of the minds around him, keeping his telepathy under tight control. He would never have gone looking for her deepest fears, nor thrown her weaknesses in her face like that. Even when he'd sparred with Nahiri, he'd been careful to avoid saying anything that would imply awareness of her thoughts.</p>

<p>She couldn't <em>know</em> that he was reading her, but it certainly felt as if he were, and she didn't like it one bit. She narrowed her eyes. He had positioned himself between her and the sylex, his slight figure presenting little barrier.</p>

<p>And then, abruptly, there were three of him, and none were the original. Kaya's physical form flashed translucent purple as she phased slightly out of touch with the rest of the plane. She couldn't detect thoughts, not the way Jace could, but she could detect spirit energy, and two of the Jaces didn't have spirits. They weren't real. Only the third, the one farthest from her current location, actually existed.</p>

<p>She turned toward Kaito. "That one," she snapped, gesturing toward the Jace in question. "Stop him."</p>

<p>Kaito didn't need to be told twice. Producing a handful of shuriken from inside his shirt, he flung them at the true Jace, his telekinesis catching them and driving them straight and true toward their target. He had aimed to stop, not to slaughter, and as the projectiles found the flesh of Jace's injured arm, the two false images flickered and died.</p>

<p>Kaya shoved her dagger into its sheath, stalking toward the true Jace, and the sylex.</p>

<p><em>"Wait,"</em> said his voice. <em>"Please."</em></p>

<p>Kaya stopped, eyes narrowed, glaring at the real Jace.</p>

<p>He looked back, pale and wan and younger than she had ever realized he was; he looked less like an all-powerful Planeswalker, and more like a man on the verge of collapse. The waving wires on his arm—which were, she finally saw, surprisingly like the tendrils of Vraska's hair in their sinuous curves and languid waving strands—had started to light up at their tips, like their eyes were opening, even as they wove their basket-like lattice more and more tightly around his arm. Soon, they would cut off all circulation, if they hadn't done so already.</p>

<p>Kaito's shuriken had severed several of the strands, leaving them to writhe and die on the floor, and cut shallow, bloodless lines into Jace's skin. The speed of Phyrexian compleation was a nightmare the likes of which Kaya had never considered, and she wanted nothing more than to wake from it.</p>

<p><em>"We have to do this,"</em> he said.</p>

<p>"No, <em>you</em> have to do this," said Kaya. "<em>We </em>have to preserve the Multiverse. All the planes Phyrexia <em>hasn't</em> touched are connected to the Blind Eternities as well, just like this damned tree—we blow it up now, we could wipe out everything."</p>

<p>"The emperor," said Kaito, sounding horrified.</p>

<p>"Any Planeswalker currently in transit," said Kaya. "All of us. I won't let you do this." She lunged for the sylex, grabbing it with both hands. "It's over, Jace. You lose. We all lose."</p>

<hr />

<p>Elspeth fell back another step, unable to stand her ground against the waves of despair and doubt washing off Tibalt. She had failed, they had all failed, Ajani was lost, and New Capenna was lost, and she was lost, this was how it ended, this had always been how it ended, she had been in denial to think she could do anything to stop it—</p>

<p>The doubt ripped at her, tearing away the veils of virtue and compassion that she had worked so hard for so long to construct, until the core of Elspeth Tirel was exposed. The child who had defied Elesh Norn on a plane without any prayer of hope; who had been able to stay unbroken before Phyrexian horrors. Ajani, seeing his opening, swung his axe at the exposed back of her neck.</p>

<p>Elspeth's sword blocked the blow, unexpectedly raised between them. He paused, blinking in surprise, only to realize that the look in her eyes was that of a cornered, feral creature.</p>

<p>Not far away, Tibalt laughed. "Oh, the pretty do-gooder fights back, does she? A pity you didn't find her sooner, Prince of Foolishness, she might have been sufficiently useless to sit beside you. Although your brother would only have snatched her away as he does everything else worth having. You could have been great without him."</p>

<p>Tyvar snarled. When Tibalt stabbed the barbs of his tail at him again, he dropped one of his daggers and grabbed the offending appendage directly behind the stinger, bending it backward even as the Glimmervoid metal that covered Tyvar's own body began to flow out, sweeping across Tibalt's flesh as the transmutation spread to take him, almost Phyrexian in its own way.</p>

<p>Tibalt hissed, trying to pull free. Tyvar didn't let him go. The Glimmervoid metal spread out to cover more and more of Tibalt's body. The flesh that had yet to be transmuted seemed almost to pull away, trying to flee the toxic change.</p>

<p>"What are you <em>doing</em>?" Tibalt demanded, in clear alarm.</p>

<p>"My magic suppresses whatever it engulfs," said Tyvar, and smiled, baring metal teeth like a threat. "Your doubt can't touch what it can't reach."</p>

<p>Indeed, Elspeth's stance grew in confidence by the moment, until two things happened: the Glimmervoid metal swallowed the last of Tibalt's flesh, and a pulse of hope strong enough that it felt like it should have burned the infection entirely from Phyrexia, like it should have lit up the Blind Eternities, surged from her body.</p>

<p>"Doubt is nothing," said Elspeth. "Doubt doesn't change what's right. I will not join your One. Neither will anyone else."</p>

<p>White light blasted outward from her blade, sending Ajani rocking back on his heels. She stood, falling into an offensive position.</p>

<p>The fight wasn't over yet.</p>

<p>Ajani cried out and staggered. Elspeth slammed the hilt of her sword down across the back of his neck, driving him to the ground. The axe tumbled from Ajani's suddenly nerveless fingers as he slipped from consciousness.</p>

<p>Eyes wild, Elspeth turned toward Tyvar and the struggling Tibalt. Tyvar shook his head.</p>

<p>"I can handle this devil," he said. "He owes me a death for what he did to my plane. Go. Find the others. I'll be fine."</p>

</div>

<p>The Glimmervoid metal was fading from his skin, and from Tibalt's as well, as the well of Tyvar's magic neared the point of running dry. Tibalt stabbed at him with his free tail, and Tyvar grabbed that one as well, bending them both backward with a strained grunt. Realizing what he was about to do, Tibalt tried to jerk away.</p>

<p>The last thing Elspeth saw before she ran off the bridge, following the trail the others had taken, was Tyvar driving the twin barbs of Tibalt's tail into the space that should have held the Phyrexian's heart. Tibalt screamed, high and agonized, and was still screaming as Tyvar shoved him from the bridge. There was a sickening crunch as Tibalt slammed into the bridge below, followed by silence.</p>

<p>Elspeth ran.</p>

<hr />

<p>Kaya grabbed the sylex, relaxing at the solidity of it before she dismissed her phase and turned solid once more—only for the sylex to dissolve in her hands like mist. She had fallen for another of Jace's illusions.</p>

<p>"Kaya!" shouted Kaito.</p>

<p>She spun to face Jace just in time to see the wires spidering across his face, eyes glowing a brighter blue than ever before. "No," she gasped.</p>

<p>Jace, face grim, looked at her across the rim of the real sylex, still held in his hands, and replied, quietly, "Yes. Kaya, I'm sorry. Kaito, I'm sorry. Everyone," and there he chuckled, dry and dark and unamused, "I'm so sorry."</p>

<p>He disappeared, shielded from view by his own magic.</p>

<p>On the other side of the illusion, Jace ran his thumbnail across his forehead, almost amazed by how quickly the skin parted<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> although what dripped from the wound into the sylex wasn't blood, not exactly. He sighed. So much lost. So much left to lose.</p>

<p>With an almost physical effort that caused him to flicker into momentary visibility, he forced his grief and fury into the bowl. Not only his grief: the suffering and sorrow-drenched agony of all Mirrodin. Regret for the Multiverse. The love of Vraska. It poured into the sylex like the finest honey, so thick and pure he could almost see it.</p>

<p>The words didn't matter. Jace knew that, but they felt right anyway. Urza had said them so long ago. Teferi had seen it, and Kaya through him, and Jace through her. An unbroken line—then to now. One end, to another. "Wipe the land clear. Bring the ending," he murmured. "I'm sorry."</p>

<p>His voice echoed in the enclosed space, impossibly loud, as light bloomed inside the bowl of the sylex, crawling upward like a living thing, nearing the rim. Kaya cried out, fear and despair, as Kaito moved to put himself between the blossoming light and the other Planeswalker. Neither of them saw Elspeth drop through the hole in the ceiling and race across the room toward Jace.</p>

<p>Jace turned to face her, his eyes ablaze with merciless blue light. Somehow, in that moment, she understood everything—what Jace had resolved to do, what was about to happen not just to Mirrodin but to the Multiverse itself. Elspeth saw, with perfect clarity, what needed to be done.</p>

<p>She didn't hesitate. In a single convulsive motion, she drove her blade through Jace and shoved him aside, letting his body take the sword with him as he fell and grabbing the sylex in her own hands.</p>

</div>

<p>She had time to glance at Kaya and Kaito as light crested over the lip of the sylex and a sharp crack echoed through the room, marking her disappearance. The sylex went with her, bound for some unknown destination, some point beyond the Blind Eternities.</p>

<p>Tyvar, bloodied and once more flesh, dropped through the hole to join Kaya, Kaito, and Jace's fallen form, moving to Kaya's side. She turned to him, eyes wild.</p>

<p>Whatever Tyvar was going to say was washed away as a series of massive booms consumed all sound, a wave of pressure washing down the trunk Realmbreaker as it pulsed with light. Each pulse lit the air with an oil-slick array of impossible colors, yanking the world around them through a cycle of nights and days as quickly as a heartbeat. The tree had been fully activated and was transmitting across the Multiverse.</p>

<p>The shock knocked all three of them to the floor, and in the rapidly pulsing light, none of them saw the moment when the wall irised open like an eye, allowing the smell of aether to fill the previously sealed room.</p>

<p>Tyvar staggered to his feet, pulling Kaya with him. Kaito had already recovered his balance on his own, and was staring upward, rapt and horrified. The others looked up and saw the branches of Realmbreaker winking out in flashes of impossible light, connected to the tree but gone at the same time. Tyvar made a small sound of dismay.</p>

<p>"They walk the Omenpaths," he said. "They carry disaster in their wake."</p>

<p>Each branch, with its heavy burden of Phyrexian invaders, had reached for another plane, and would shed their terrible fruit there, to compleat new, fertile soil.</p>

<p>"The sylex is <em>gone</em>," Kaya moaned. "Elspeth is <em>gone</em>, Jace is <em>gone</em>, the Multiverse is doomed, we failed, Tyvar, we failed."</p>

<p>"I saw hope this day," said Tyvar. "We haven't failed."</p>

<p>"Um, guys?" said Kaito, he gripped his sword with both hands and stepped up to stand with Tyvar, the two of them presenting a wall of resistance between Kaya and the opening on the wall. The faint sound of footsteps came from the other side. "I think we're about to have company."</p>

<p>The trio shrank back from the new doorway, until Kaya's shoulders were almost touching the pulsing, gleaming trunk of Realmbreaker. All three readied their weapons, Tyvar's flesh transmuting once more to Glimmervoid metal as he stood side by side with the wiry ninja. They exchanged one final glance, expressions equally grim. Nothing approaching in Phyrexia could be a friend, not in this moment, not in this space.</p>

<p>Footsteps echoed into the room, unbearably loud, bouncing off the walls and ceiling. A figure, almost skeletally thin, made of flensed red tissue and gleaming porcelain-white metal, stepped into the room. Elesh Norn turned her eyeless face toward the remaining Planeswalkers and smiled, even as a squadron of Phyrexian warriors slipped in after her. Kaito gasped sharply at the sight of Tamiyo moving among them, all her softness sharpened to bladed points, her eyes traced by black trails of glistening oil.</p>

<p>"Welcome, weary travelers, to Phyrexia," said Elesh Norn. She turned her smile to Jace's corpse, which shuddered and stood, Elspeth's sword slipping from his body as he moved to join his new master. Kaito grabbed the blade as soon as it was unprotected, settling it into his free hand.</p>

<p>Elesh Norn laughed. "So worried," she said. "We offer you no threat. We offer only harmony and peace. We are One. All will be One. Why resist? Your friends are already here."</p>

<p>She turned her smile toward the ranks of her subordinates. They parted, and a new shape moved through them, into the light.</p>

<p>Nahiri had clearly not survived her fall. The spikes that had been breaking through the skin of her back and shoulders were more pronounced now, turning her outline into a grotesque parody of her own floating cloud of blades. Her hands were gone, arms replaced from the elbow down with metal blades. Cracks ran through the metallic skin of her body, showing molten metal beneath, and her eyes glowed with the same terrible, burning heat.</p>

<p>Kaito hissed between his teeth, seeing the very opponent he had feared appear before him. "You've looked better," he said.</p>

<p>Nahiri didn't react. Another figure followed her on a forest of whip-thin cabling, using the root-link formations of her lower body like tentacles as she settled by the other Phyrexian's side. Extra appendages sprouted from the woody protrusions covering her flesh. Her face, like Tamiyo's, was marked with glistening oil. Kaya stared. The Nissa she knew was gone. Nothing of the soft-spoken animist remained.</p>

<p>Tyvar bared his teeth, adjusting his grip on his daggers. To see another elf so maimed and misused was painful, despite the shortness of their acquaintance. This was more than horror. This was an offense.</p>

<p>"Nahiri fought us, but she found peace, and a better way in the One," said Elesh Norn. "She and Nissa came from the same place, but they were never friends. Now they are sisters, united, finally on the same side in every way. They are One. You, too, can be One. Only yield, and it will be over quickly."</p>

<p>"No," said Tyvar.</p>

<p>"I'm good," said Kaito.</p>

<p>"Go to hell," said Kaya.</p>

<p>"Such hostility," said Elesh Norn. "It seems we have no way to an accord, then. If you would be our enemies, then very well. Enemies it is."</p>

<p>With that, Elesh Norn raised her hand, clicking her perfect claws together, and the invasion began.</p>

Nahiri's sacrifice had moved them closer to their goal. It had also slowed them—save for Kaya—considerably, since tripping on the rubble would mean a long fall into the depths of the layer.</p>

<p>The hole in the pristine sky above them was still visible, a jagged wound in the porcelain perfection of this place, boiling with every color of Phyrexia. They hurried through a war, and while no one could have called them untouched by its horrors, for the moment, they were too small to attract attention.</p>

<p>Elspeth shot a venomous glance at the warriors overhead. <em>Just you wait</em>, she thought, as fiercely as she could. <em>You'll regret what you've done to us.</em></p>

<p>They wouldn't. She knew that. Even if everything went perfectly from here, even if they plucked an impossible victory from this chaos, Phyrexia wouldn't regret destroying Mirrodin. They weren't made for regretting things. Phyrexia moved for the greater good and glory of Phyrexia, and in the end, that was all that mattered. All would be One, or nothing would exist at all.</p>

<p>The high bridge where they'd landed seemed too delicate to have withstood the impact of such a massive piece of Sheoldred's Coliseum. Even if the bridge would normally have been sturdy enough, the nature of their arrival should have lent them even more weight, the magnitude of Nahiri's sacrifice sending them plummeting into the fathomless white depths. Glancing over the edge, Elspeth could see farther into the layer below than seemed entirely possible. A lattice of alabaster platforms spanned the spaces all around them, connected by long bridges of crimson sinew.</p>

<p>After the tarnished necrogen wastes of the Dross Pits, this place reminded Elspeth of blood splashed across the white sands of Theros, sullying what should have been pristine. Koth, Melira, and the goblin engineers were born Mirrans. The Planeswalkers were strangers here, but this was <em>Mirrodin</em>, this was <em>their</em> plane, not Phyrexia's, no matter how much the glistening oil transformed it. They should never have looked out of place in their own homeland.</p>

<p>Clusters of buildings rose from platforms in the latticework like organic sculptures, blending the sleek curve of machined metal with the organic roughness of bone and sinew. Everything was red against white, a whole plane made over in Elesh Norn's image, like some terrible dream.</p>

<p>For all that the bridges were clearly designed to provide easy passage to multitudes of Phyrexians, they were empty save for the Planeswalkers themselves. The battle raging above them was too far away for even the echoes to drift down to them; they might as well have been alone. A faint song filled the air instead, as if the very structures sang to them, a Phyrexian hymn of horrors.</p>

<p>"Nahiri made a huge sacrifice, for us," said Koth. "We have to keep moving to honor the ending she chose."</p>

<p>"She was infected," said Elspeth. "I saw the changes in her, right before the end. There's no way she hadn't realized it was happening. But she never said anything."</p>

<p>"She told me," said Melira, moving through the group to pace them. "She asked me if I could help her when we were back at the Furnace."</p>

<p>"Could you have?" asked Elspeth.</p>

<p>"I could," said Melira, and took a deep breath. "I could have helped her, but reversing the process of phyresis is like pulling a bramble from fertile soil. It throws down a hundred roots. When you dig out one, you find a hundred more. Repairing her body from the damage already done would have left her incapacitated for days. She would have had to stay behind."</p>

<p>"She would have seen that as wasting time we didn't have," said Elspeth.</p>

<p>They had managed to catch up to Kaya while they were speaking. Kaya looked at them, listening, before she asked, "Could you do that sort of healing for Jace?"</p>

<p>"If he was willing to let me," said Melira.</p>

<p>Kaya looked back to where Jace walked along, reserved, the sylex bouncing in the satchel at his hip. The wound on his arm had turned: wire and bright metal shone through the burn. What flesh remained was raw and wet, blackening as it transmuted to fibrous cable.</p>

<p>"I don't think he's going to let us do that," she said, voice going soft.</p>

<p><em>"Then you know me better than you think you do,"</em> said Jace's voice in her head. Melira, who had less experience with telepathy than most of the others, looked surprised. <em>"Really, did you think I wouldn't be paying attention to you debating my future? I'm not risking us all to save my own life, not when we've already lost Vraska. That's more weight than I'm willing to carry."</em></p>

<p>"Glad to see you're still with us, Jace," said Kaya.</p>

<p><em>"For now,"</em> Jace grimly replied. His mental voice fell silent again, all his energy going to moving onward.</p>

<p>"We honor Nahiri's story, and the ending she wrote for it, by finishing this in victory," said Tyvar, who had been walking close behind with Kaito. "A grand sacrifice demands a grand recounting."</p>

<p>"I just hope she's dead," said Kaito.</p>

<p>Elspeth turned to look at him, stunned. "Explain that," she said.</p>

<p>The lanky Planeswalker shrugged, the tanuki on his shoulder bobbing with the motion. "You have to admit, she's probably the most powerful of us."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Elspeth, slowly.</p>

<p>"She's been traveling for so long I doubt any one of us could take her down," he continued. "Maybe not any two of us. But one on one, that kind of raw power? I'd go down, and so would you. I don't want to face her on the other side of a battlefield. She chose to make sure we could keep moving even when it meant splitting herself off from the one person who might be able to save her. I hope she made that sacrifice all the way and doesn't get caught in the middle and turn against the people she was trying to protect."</p>

<p>"At times it's better to grieve a companion than it is to risk fighting against them," said Tyvar, sounding subdued for once.</p>

<p>It was an unsettling thought, and one Elspeth didn't want to dwell on, even as she knew that it was unavoidable. They hadn't found a body among the debris. Though Nahiri sacrificed herself for them, she might still come back in a changed form, transformed into an inexhaustible enemy.</p>

<p>"Well, that's awful," said Kaya. "Thank you for that."</p>

<p>"This doesn't seem like a good place for pretty illusions." Kaito shrugged. "When we don't see things as they really are, we just wind up getting hurt."</p>

<p>"Uh, what in the hells is <em>that</em>?" asked Kaya, stopping dead in the middle of the pathway and staring, open-mouthed, at a stationary colossus looming up from far below them.</p>

<p>Its head was an inverted teardrop of the white metal, split in the center by a single empty red socket, as if something even larger had come along and plucked out its eye. The form of its body was hunched and elongated, making it all but impossible to draw comparisons between it and any more ordinary body form. It was neither insectile nor reptilian, not humanoid or built along any other predictable plan. All of it was cast in red and white, making it an almost perfect match to the landscape. Before Kaya drew her attention to it, Elspeth had taken it for another monumental building.</p>

<p>"Elesh Norn doesn't like to give up what she thinks belongs to her," said Koth darkly. "She has her favorites—the ones who serve her best or fight her the most fiercely—ossified. Turned to bone and added to her Fair Basilica." He pointed to the statue. "We should still be careful. I've seen structures like this become animated and kill Mirrans who got too close."</p>

<p>So this could be a statue, or it could be a Phyrexian that was going to strike as soon as they moved closer. Its position put it alongside the bridge, a looming threat. Elspeth grimaced, gripping the hilt of her sword.</p>

<p>"Can we move to a safer bridge?" asked Kaito.</p>

<p>"Not if we want to reach Elesh Norn's altar," said Koth. "From there, we can access the Mycosynth Gardens. That's where we get access to the Seedcore, and that's where she's planted her Realmbreaker. That's where we have to go."</p>

<p>"I still fail to understand how she could have planted even a mockery of a World Tree," said Tyvar. The scope of the Fair Basilica stole some of the presence from his normally resonant voice, making him sound reduced.</p>

<p>They were all reduced here. They were lessened in the presence of Phyrexia.</p>

<p>Tyvar continued: "The World Tree grows within the Cosmos itself, linking the realms of Kaldheim. It exists both inside and outside of reality. Even if someone could somehow steal a seed, it should have split this plane in two when it sprouted. The fact that it hasn't is a miracle and a horror."</p>

<p>"We had never seen such a thing before," said Koth. "Most still haven't. Melira is the only spy we have who's made it to the tree and back again."</p>

<p>"Only because they can't infect me," said Melira. "Everyone who'd gone into the gardens with me and survived long enough to make it out again succumbed before we could make it home. Norn's tree is planted below in the Seedcore, where she imprisoned Karn. It's a terrible thing, that tree. Tyvar is right—to look at it, you'd think it would split the plane in two. Its roots drive deep, and its branches reach so high they penetrate into the Mycosynth Gardens." She frowned. "At some point, looking at them is like looking at something underwater. The branches are all funny and distorted, and they're not quite right."</p>

<p>"Omenpaths," said Tyvar. "Somehow, she's generating Omenpaths on the branches of a tree that has no right to be." He scowled, first at nothing, then at the motionless giant looming nearby. "We have to end it."</p>

<p>"That's why we're here," said Kaya. She looked to Koth. "Can we keep going?"</p>

<p>"If it's going to attack, it's going to attack," he said. "Elesh Norn's altar isn't far." He pointed to a building larger than the others, more ornate, stretching toward the sky like a citadel of gleaming white and brutal red, organic and mechanical at once. It was beautiful in its own severe, austere way. It was a monument to a unified Phyrexia.</p>

<p>It hurt Elspeth's eyes if she looked at it for too long. Tightening her grip on her sword, she nodded. "We keep going."</p>

<p>They resumed their walk. They were more together now than they'd been when they started along the bridge. Kaya still kept herself on the other side of the group from Jace, but whatever he'd said to make her give him the sylex, she was no longer outright glowering at him.</p>

<p>The goliath didn't move. They passed under its empty gaze without complication and moved toward the cluster of buildings at the end of the bridge. Kaya remained at the head of their group, phasing through the debris in her path rather than detouring around it, little flecks of purple energy marking her wake.</p>

<p>Koth, Elspeth, and the Mirrans came next, Kaito only a foot or so behind, walking between them and Tyvar, while Jace brought up the rear with the sylex. Tyvar kept glancing back at him, finally saying, "Hurry along, friend Jace. We wouldn't want to lose you now."</p>

<p>"No, I suppose we wouldn't," said Jace, a ribbon of black humor in his tone. "Can't save the Multiverse without me."</p>

<p>The doors of the altar gaped open before them, the terrible maw of an impossible and all-consuming beast. It looked as if it had been frozen between life and death, both stationary architecture and petrified corpse. Looking at it made the flesh on Elspeth's arms crawl. But they kept going, alert and braced for trouble, into the empty foyer.</p>

<p>"I feel very much as if we're walking into a trap right now," said Tyvar, voice hushed less out of respect for the space than out of a very realistic desire not to attract attention. Frozen Phyrexians studded the walls: Elesh Norn's most beloved subjects.</p>

<div class="figure-wrapper">

</div>

<p>"That's because we probably are," said Kaya. "First we get scattered across the surface, then we find Vraska alive and able to hold on just long enough to scream for Jace? With Ajani on their side, they were able to anticipate our plan of attack. He knows too much about us. This Elesh Norn you keep invoking sounds smart enough to use him against us."</p>

<p>"Smart, yes, all-knowing, no," said Melira. "Her forces are distracted by the rebellion. We have to keep moving."</p>

<p>They pressed deeper into the silent building, passing columns made of motionless bodies, walls that wept ivy-like trails of sinew and boasted row upon row of horrifically human-looking teeth, and a thousand other Phyrexian nightmares. The Fair Basilica knew no end, and they were going to see it all.</p>

<hr />

<p>The winding stairway from the Fair Basilica down into the Mycosynth Gardens was accessed via a chamber below Elesh Norn's throne. It, too, was unguarded, and the Planeswalkers clustered together as the feeling of moving into a trap grew stronger. Tyvar fingered his piece of Glimmervoid metal, waiting for the moment when he would need to convert his body to the harder, more resilient substance. Conserving his magic for the moment when it would be needed was harder than he would have expected; this place just made him want to stay armored at all times.</p>

<p>They were heroes all, grand allies in the fight against a terrible enemy, and he was glad beyond measure that his story had led him to their side. In the stories, the greater the losses, the greater the victory to follow. But it was hard to remember that now, under the weight of Phyrexia and the future.</p>

<p>At the base of the stair was a platform of shining blue metal—a small slice of the Fair Basilica that extended into the sphere below. The stairway they had used to descend was an enclosed column behind them, stretching back upward to the distant ceiling.</p>

<p>The column's first half, closest to the Fair Basilica, was white metal. As it approached the ground, it gave way to steely blueish gray, becoming oddly textured, almost pebbled. Kaya blinked, raising her hand as if to touch the wall.</p>

<p>"No," said Melira, harshly. Kaya looked at her in surprise, lowering her hand again. Melira relaxed slightly, and explained, "It's mycosynth. This is how Phyrexia took us in the first place. They invaded Mirrodin's heart and sent their infectious spores cascading through everything we were."</p>

<p>Kaya glanced at the wall again, then stepped closer to Koth and his explosives team. "Good to know," she said.</p>

<p>"Forgive me, Melira, but I see no tree," said Tyvar.</p>

<p>Jace groaned.</p>

<p>The group whipped around to see him clutching his stomach, split skin parting farther as the writhing metallic "veins" beneath fought for dominion over the tissues of his body. He managed to straighten, eyes glowing faintly blue as his voice echoed in their heads.</p>

<p><em>"Melira said we sought the Seedcore. We must go deeper."</em></p>

<p>"Deeper," said Koth. "Yes. Elesh Norn forbids access to the Seedcore."</p>

<p>"But there <em>is</em> still a way," said Melira. "Elesh Norn can't pass through solid matter like your friend here." She hooked a thumb at Kaya. "We just have to reach the door. And get through it."</p>

<p>The Planeswalkers looked around the metal-laced landscape, columned in delicate mycosynth, but saw no structures aside from the one to their back.</p>

</div>

<p>"Where?" asked Elspeth.</p>

<p>"This way," said Melira, and set out across the rough ground.</p>

<p>The others followed her, careful to avoid the mycosynth pillars, sticking close together to avoid surprises. She led them to a piled-up structure of fungal strands that twisted into a mimicry of entrails, as if some great beast had been gutted here.</p>

<p>Gesturing to the pile, Melira said, "The gateway into the Seedcore. It infects anything it touches. I guess Elesh Norn figures any Mirran strong enough to get this far deserves the honor of compleation. Luckily, I'm immune to phyresis—even the glistening oil doesn't stick to me for long."</p>

<p>As she moved closer to the pile, it heaved, pulsing, before opening into a terrible hole into darkness ringed with waving tendrils. An entrance masquerading as a monster anemone. The tendrils reached out, almost caressing her, and left a sheen of glistening oil behind. She wiped it away as she turned back to the rest.</p>

<p>Koth frowned. "Most of us don't have your specific resistance, Melira. We'll have to blow the ground."</p>

<p>"Why are we messing with it? That loses us any cover we have," said Kaito. "Isn't there another way down?"</p>

<p>"I may have another way," said Tyvar. He held up his piece of Glimmervoid metal. "In the coliseum, Kaito removed Phyrexian oil from my skin before it could work its way inside. If he can clean the oil off quickly enough, I can spread my magic through the lot of us while we pass through to the Seedcore. It will have to be quick. Transmuting this many people is a feat even I won't be able to maintain for long. But it should lend us a measure of protection—enough for Kaito to do his part."</p>

<p>"I can do it, but this stuff resists my telekinesis, and it's going to give me a major headache," said Kaito, stepping into position.</p>

<p>Melira frowned. "I suppose we can try," she said. "How does this work?"</p>

<p>"Just give me a moment," said Tyvar. "None of you will be able to access your own magic while mine lays across you, but that only means we move quickly."</p>

<p>Kaito looked alarmed. "How am I supposed to clean the oil off if my magic is out of reach?"</p>

<p>"The Halo you took before should protect you enough for a few seconds," said Koth. "We can buy you that much."</p>

<p>Kaito nodded, and the group coalesced around Tyvar, who took a deep breath. The smell of green growing things swirled around them, cutting through the oily fungal scent of the mycosynth. Of the group, only Kaya recognized it as the smell of Kaldheim air. Metal began to spread across Tyvar's skin, slowly at first, and then faster and faster, until his body was a Glimmervoid metal sculpture.</p>

<p>The metal continued to spread, covering them all without difficulty. Jace was the last to be fully transformed, the injury on his arm appearing to almost resist the process, as if Phyrexia wasn't willing to yield its hold for even a moment.</p>

<p>When the process was done, Tyvar held up his hand and said, "We move."</p>

<p>They proceeded as a group into the caressing mass of tendrils, which brushed their hardened skins and left streaks of oil behind but didn't attack. Ahead of them was a narrow hall that ended in an open vestibule connected to what looked like a single bridge. They hurried on, not wanting to find the limits of Tyvar's magic before they had cleared the hall.</p>

<p>At the end, they emerged not into the terrible Phyrexian landscape they had all become accustomed to but into something vital and alive, and even more horrific because it was growing. Tyvar looked to Kaito. Kaito nodded, and Tyvar released the spell.</p>

<p>The Glimmervoid metal melted away, leaving them all flesh once more, skins glistening with oil. Kaito rolled his shoulders, and the oil lifted away from their bodies, coalescing into a ball that lobbed itself off the edge of the bridge.</p>

<p>"Thanks," said Kaya. "Hey, Tyvar, good show—Tyvar?"</p>

<p>He didn't respond. He was staring at something in the distance, stepping toward the bridge with eyes wide and cheeks gone pale.</p>

<p>Kaya turned and beheld the Phyrexian World Tree. <em>Realmbreaker.</em></p>

<p>It was clear that Elesh Norn had cultivated, nurtured, and corrupted it. Its bark was made of the white porcelain metal they'd seen above, and where growth had opened fissures in its surface, vivid, agonized red gleamed through. It wept glistening oil in place of sap, and strange shadows moved along its surface, confusing until Kaya glanced farther up. Long, white oblongs hung in the air near the highest branches of the impossible tree, fading partially into the distorted distance as they reached for the Blind Eternities.</p>

<p>"Invasion ships," said Koth grimly. "They're almost ready."</p>

<p>"This is a perversion of Kaldheim's very soul," said Tyvar. "I knew this was foul, but this<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> this is beyond imagining."</p>

<p>The air was still, eerily so, as if the entire realm was holding its breath. High above, in the distant branches of the reaching tree, a white light bloomed and flashed out, spreading in a horribly symmetrical lattice through the upper reaches of the sky.</p>

<p>"We have to hurry," said Jace.</p>

<p>They ran. The bridge connecting the gardens to the core of New Phyrexia was a narrow line above a bottomless drop; at the other end of the bridge was a dark opening in the tangled roots of the tree. The Planeswalkers were nearly there when the sky flashed again, brighter this time, like a sun exploding in the high reaches.</p>

<p>The cataclysmic explosions filled the air with glistening rainbow distortions, followed by the bright impossibility of the Blind Eternities. Jace moaned. Elspeth stumbled, only saved from going over the bridge's edge by Koth's hand grasping her shoulder and yanking her back.</p>

<p>Kaya only stared upward, expression gone blank. "We're too late," she said.</p>

<p>"Kaya—" said Kaito.</p>

<p>She whipped around to face him. "<em>It was all for nothing</em>," she snapped. "The World Tree has connected to the Multiverse. Elesh Norn can access the Blind Eternities. We <em>failed</em>."</p>

<p>"I refuse to let Kaldheim's heart be the weapon that destroys the Multiverse," said Tyvar. "We can still do our best to undo this."</p>

<p>"Hurry," said Jace, breathless. "We have to hurry." He only made it a few more steps, staggering, before collapsing to the ground.</p>

<p>"Tyvar," said Koth.</p>

<p>Tyvar nodded, and—touching the piece of Glimmervoid metal—rippled to metal as he approached Jace and scooped the other man into his arms. Together, the group continued onward, into the opening, into the dark.</p>

<hr />

<p>The entryway led into a cavity inside the tree, a great domed room formed from woven roots. Dark passages split off from the chamber, with the large one directly ahead seeming to be the main channel. At the center of the space, atop a low dais, was Karn.</p>

<p>The great silver golem had been broken open, vivisected, and spread across the platform. Most horrifying of all, at the sound of their footsteps, he turned his head and croaked, "You shouldn't have come here. This place isn't for you."</p>

<p>"Karn!" Koth and Elspeth hurried toward him but stopped short of touching him, staring at the damage.</p>

<p>"What have they done?" asked Elspeth.</p>

<p>"Isn't it obvious? They've rejected their Father of Machines." Karn shook his head. It seemed to be all the motion he had left to him. "Hurry. The invasion is still young. You may still be able to save some of the planes. Unless<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> no. The sylex was destroyed. All is lost."</p>

<p>"We made another," said Elspeth. "We can still end this."</p>

<p>Karn paused, clearly thinking. "You will need to get to the root source and detonate it."</p>

<p>"But—" began Melira, stopping at a sharp glance from Koth.</p>

<p>"I would take the burden from you if I could," said Karn. "It should have been my task all along. You should be free to go to your homes and protect them from what's about to come."</p>

<p>"You can't, though," said Kaya. "You can't even move."</p>

<p>"It's too late for me," said Karn.</p>

<p>"Not just you," said Jace, pushing against Tyvar's chest. The other man put him down, and he approached Karn, arm turned to show the spreading damage from his injury. "It's too late for me, too. Let me take the Multiverse from them."</p>

<p>He hobbled toward the doorway on the other side of the room. After an uncomfortable pause, Tyvar and Kaya followed.</p>

<p>Melira moved to kneel by Karn's head, wiping away the trails of glistening oil and attempting to shift him into a more comfortable position. Koth and the explosives team fanned out around him and began setting charges to free him from his restraints. Elspeth paused in the doorway, neither following the other Planeswalkers nor aiding Karn, and looked back at him.</p>

<p>"I should—they need—but do you want me to stay?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I want to say yes, out of selfishness, but I can't," Karn rasped. "I never thought you would see this plane again. I'm so sorry. I wish you didn't have to die with us."</p>

<p>"It was my choice, Karn."</p>

<p>"You should go with your friends, and then get off this plane. Find a better place to make a final stand."</p>

<p>"No," said Elspeth. "No more running."</p>

<p>Karn sighed, voice apparently exhausted.</p>

<p>"We'll stay here to help shape the charges and aid Karn once he's free," said Koth. "Go."</p>

<p>"I wish I didn't have to."</p>

<p>"It's all right," said Melira, and summoned up a smile. "We made it farther together than I thought we would."</p>

<p>"I'll see you all soon," said Elspeth, and walked through the doorway toward the root source.</p>

<hr />

<p>The final bridge was long and white and riddled with red.</p>

<p>So many of her friends, dead or lost. Ajani, his mind warped and his body doomed never to die now that he'd been absorbed into Phyrexia. Karn, possibly damaged beyond repair. Her anger was vast, and more agonizing because it was so new. She had lost more than she would ever have believed possible. She felt like her entire being was an old wound that had been sliced open, larger than ever and unhealable.</p>

<p>Elspeth broke into a run.</p>

<p>She caught up to the others halfway across the bridge, approaching a terrible replica of Elesh Norn's altar. This one was made of Realmbreaker's woven roots, rather than ossified Phyrexian bodies, but clearly served the same purpose. It hurt the eye and beguiled the heart at the same time, and Elspeth hated it more than she would have thought possible.</p>

<p>Jace was back on his own feet; he glanced at her as she rejoined the group, giving a small nod of welcome, and said nothing. This place was as alive as the Basilica had been still: the air hummed with an uncanny chorus of discordant voices, layered across each other to form a harmony of inchoate parts, rather than the cacophony it should have been.</p>

<p>"Phyrexians can harmonize?" breathed Kaya.</p>

<p>Static shimmered in the air, which tasted bright with aether. The root ceiling above them gaped as they drew closer to the trunk, a tapestry of finer roots allowing them to look upward at the great bulk of the World Tree itself. It twisted through an open rent into the Blind Eternities, flashes of other planes showing through the haze. The upper branches crackled with the energy Tyvar called "Omenpaths." From this angle, they could see long gangways connecting the oblong white capsules of the invasion vessels to the trees. Phyrexians shuffled along the gangways, readying their assault on the Multiverse.</p>

<p>The smoke the vessels spewed was red. Red as blood, red as contagion.</p>

<p>"How many <em>are</em> there?" asked Kaya." There must be millions of them," said Kaito, in quiet horror.</p>

<p>"They only showed us what they thought we were worth," said Jace. The white ships reached all the way into the highest branches, terrible fruit preparing for the harvest. "They've been down here preparing for the real fight all along."</p>

<p>Behind them on the bridge, they heard footsteps, steady and confident. As a group they turned, all with hands on weapons save for Jace, who clutched the sylex and took a half-step back, away from the coming conflict.</p>

<p>There, walking toward them as calmly as if this were a pleasant afternoon meeting in a park, came Ajani and Tibalt, but not as they had known them. Ajani wore a suit of metallic red and white armor that appeared to have grown out of his body. It echoed the Fair Basilica, marking him as one of Elesh Norn's creatures. He carried a massive double-headed axe, the blades reversed in her honor.</p>

<p>Seeing her mentor draped in the livery of her greatest enemy made bile rise in Elspeth's throat, but not nearly as much as the smile that spread across his face at the sight of her. "Welcome," he called, and his voice was the same as it had always been. "Elspeth, my dear, it's wonderful to see you again. I'm so glad you survived to join me."</p>

<p>"I'm not here to join you," she spat, bringing her sword around in front of herself and gripping it tightly. "I'm here to <em>stop</em> you."</p>

<p>"Why would you want to do that?" he asked, with honest curiosity. "Now we can be together forever, perfect and harmonious. No more differences, no more conflict, no more pain. You will be home. We'll have the peace we've always sought. All will be One."</p>

<p>"Never," Elspeth said.</p>

<p>Beside him, Tibalt was a nightmare of bony plates and protrusions connected by raw, braided sinew, recognizable as himself only through the smirk on the remaining fleshy portion of his face. His tail, always bifurcated at the tip, had split all the way to the base, and now terminated in two wicked stingers that dripped glistening oil onto the root path behind him.</p>

<p>"You were a monster in Kaldheim, and now you finally look the part," said Tyvar, surprisingly calm.</p>

<p>"Little princeling, too stupid to know when to be afraid," sneered Tibalt. "You were always going to end at my hand."</p>

<p>"Kaito, see the others to their destination," said Tyvar, not taking his eyes off Tibalt. "Elspeth and I will handle the vermin."</p>

<p>"Tyvar—"</p>

<p>"<em>Go</em>," snapped the elf, without turning. "These fights were predestined as ours to win. The skalds will sing of the stand we make today, but only if someone survives to tell our story. <em>Go</em>."</p>

<p>"If you say so," said Kaito, and waved a sad, forced goodbye as he turned to offer his arm to the limping Jace, guiding him toward the doorway at the back of the room. Kaya followed with one last regretful look, and the three vanished, leaving Tyvar and Elspeth alone with their transformed enemies.</p>

<p>"Very well then," said Tyvar, almost formally. "Shall we engage?"</p>

<p>Ajani roared as Elspeth leapt toward him, and Tibalt lunged for Tyvar as Glimmervoid metal rippled across the hero's skin, and the battle was joined.</p>

The enclosing walls whipped by too fast to focus on, concealing the unspeakable horrors and horrific wonders of the transformed plane.</p>

<p>Elspeth clung to the cart, aware that a single bump could leave her tumbling and alone in the depths of this hostile, breathtaking darkness.</p>

<p>For the first time, she wished she were riding with the other Planeswalkers, instead of the Mirrans. Someone who could have provided her with a distraction. Instead, there was only the descent and the dark, and the elves at the controls, holding on as tightly as she was.</p>

<p>There had been a little time for conversation between their departure and the beginning of what she couldn't help thinking of as a plummet, the two operators eager to share what they knew of their gutted plane with the person they had been told might be a potential savior. Oh, how she wanted to earn that title! They were as unfamiliar to Elspeth as she was to them. She was ashamed to admit to herself that she was grateful for that unfamiliarity. It was easier for people to see you as a hero if they had never seen you fail.</p>

<p>She had already failed Mirrodin once, and this broken place was her punishment and payment for that mistake. She couldn't see the Multiverse suffer the same fate. She would die preventing it, if that was what she had to do.</p>

<p><em>"We're bypassing the Hunter Maze and the Surgical Bay,"</em> they had said. <em>"Be grateful for that. We're sparing you things you should never have to see."</em></p>

<p><em>"The Hunter Maze <nbsp>. . . ?</nbsp>"</em></p>

<p><em>"You might remember it as the Tangle. Vorinclex transported the worst of it beneath the surface during the great transformation, using it as the seed of his new empire."</em> The one who replied had looked almost wistful. He had probably been born in the Tangle; he probably remembered it as free and vital and beautiful, and thought it could be that way again.</p>

<p>Their plummet had begun shortly thereafter, and the operators had become too busy to continue their explanation of the landscape she wouldn't have to see. Elspeth shut her eyes against the rushing wind—there was nothing beyond the faint metallic glow of the cart's central steering apparatus, anyway; the darkness of New Phyrexia was all-encompassing, without even the gravitational magic of the lacuna to gentle their descent—and hung on for dear life.</p>

<p>Then, bit by bit, they began leveling off. She cracked her eyes open, and almost immediately wished she hadn't.</p>

<p>The sky, such as it was, was a sea of leprous clouds that roiled and shifted endlessly, somehow giving the appearance of rotting from the inside out even while hanging in the air. Pools of glowing green liquid she recognized as necrogen dominated the landscape, casting an eerie green light. Even before Phyrexia, it had been deadly, capable of transmuting the unwary into the undead. Now it could do that <em>or</em> induce phyresis, and she wanted no part of either option.</p>

<p>Elspeth looked at her hand and winced. The necrogen light made her look sallow, like she was rotting. The pallid complexions of her companions mirrored her own. As far as this place was concerned, they were already dead.</p>

<p>"Everything rots here," said one of the operators. He kept his attention focused on steering their cart to the end of the line, where the rest were already waiting. "If you stay too long, breathing in the fumes, you'll rot, too."</p>

<p>"It's not as bad as the Surgical Bay," said the other, her own face drawn with worry. "There, if you get too close to one of the fountains, you can find phyresis starting just because you breathed the spray. The fumes kill you before they turn you."</p>

<p>Elspeth unlocked her fingers from the bar she'd been gripping and stood, shaking the cramp out of her hands. "That's horrible," she said.</p>

<p>"That's New Phyrexia," said the first operator. "It changes what it can, kills what it can't, and converts the ruins into its own image."</p>

<p>They were still slowing, now almost at a stop. The other carts weren't far ahead, their passengers in various stages of gathering their gear and disembarking. Koth's demolition team was testing the blackened ground between pools of necrogen with long metal poles, scouting out the closest thing they were going to find to a safe path through this nightmare.</p>

<p>"We have a tunnel not far from here that should take us straight to the Fair Basilica," said Koth, voice grave but not grim.</p>

<p>If he hadn't lost all hope by this point, Elspeth suspected he never would.</p>

<p>"You make it sound so easy," said Nahiri, hopping down from her cart, heels thumping against the ground. It seemed impossible that she should manage to avoid the necrogen, but she spoke the language of metal and stone; the sphere was probably telling her all its secrets even now. No point in worrying about Nahiri, who was moving toward Koth without hesitation. "But it's not going to be, is it?"</p>

<p>"No," said Koth. "If we take the most direct route, we might be able to avoid the majority of Thrissik's forces. If we can't avoid them, they'll be trying to take you alive if they can. He's building cairns to bring about his Destroyer, and the strongest mages are the best building materials."</p>

<p>Nahiri lifted an eyebrow. Kaya, who had solved the problem of avoiding the necrogen by phasing her lower legs into purple translucency, snorted. "Yeah, yeah, we're always the best targets."</p>

<p>"At least the chaos should give us some cover." Greeted with blank looks from the Planeswalkers, Koth smiled a quick and terrible smile. "Seven thanes rule the Dross Pits, but they've never been united. Four have thrown in their lot with Urabrask. Roxith, Geth, Vraan, and Sheoldred are lending their forces to the rebellion against Norn's Phyrexia. The remaining three are likely to be distracted, grabbing for territory, watching for betrayal. We have a better shot at our goal. But we have to move now."</p>

<p>"If this is when we can move without being seen, that means we're out of here," said Kaito, and stepped down from the cart. Tyvar was close behind him, spinning his piece of Glimmervoid metal between his fingers like a coin as he grinned at Kaya.</p>

<p>"My friend is fond of being overlooked," he said. "An admirable, if incomprehensible, desire."</p>

<p>Elspeth shrugged off her pack as she moved to join the group. They were what remained of the strike team: they were the only hope the Multiverse had of being spared from the Phyrexian apocalypse. They had to win.</p>

<p>"Here," she said, opening the bag and removing a string of glass Halo bottles, individual doses tied together with a leather band, their corks pushed firmly down. "This will protect us from the necrogen in the air for a little while."</p>

<p>She passed the bottles around, waiting until everyone had one before uncapping her own and downing its contents. As always, the taste was effervescent and clean, citrus-bright and sweet without being cloying. She wiped her mouth and looked around to see the others doing the same.</p>

<p>Jace swallowed the last of his Halo and breathed in sharply, the bottle slipping from his fingers before he collapsed backward onto the cart behind him. The Mirrans around him exclaimed in dismay as Kaya raced over to crouch beside him, feeling for his pulse.</p>

<p>After a moment, she looked up, eyes wild. "His pulse is going haywire," she said. "Elspeth, what did you <em>do</em>?"</p>

<p>"Nothing—unless the necrogen was stopping something else from happening." Elspeth moved quickly to Kaya's side. Jace was starting to twitch, not quite thrashing, but clearly not in control of his motions. "Let me see him."</p>

<p>Melira was close on her heels but stopped when she saw Jace. "This isn't phyresis," she said. "I don't know what this is."</p>

<p>"The Halo can't <em>hurt</em> people," said Elspeth frantically. She reached for Jace, then froze, wincing. "He's in pain. So much pain. It's burning him alive. I would have noticed if he'd been in pain like this while we were higher up. This is new. This started when he collapsed<nbsp> . . .</nbsp>"</p>

<p>"We have to get out of here," said one of the cart operators, looking to Koth. "We didn't come prepared to linger in the Dross Pits longer than it took to make a drop-off. I'm sorry. Even with the lady's magic juice, we should get out of here."</p>

<p>"And we should do the same," said Koth. "Whether we send your friend back up with the others or carry him, we have to move."</p>

<p>"I can carry him," said Tyvar. "We need him for the plan to work."</p>

<p>"But he's not the only one who knows how to operate the sylex." Nahiri glanced at Kaya. "She's trained as well. Both of them can do it."</p>

<p>"I'm the backup," said Kaya. "I only take point if he's incapacitated."</p>

<p>"This looks pretty incapacitated to me," said Nahiri.</p>

<p>Jace gasped and sat up, bluish-white light crackling in the air around him as the motion knocked Kaya to the side. He twisted wildly, staring at nothing, before he shoved himself to his feet and leapt from the cart, seemingly determined to take off across the blackened landscape.</p>

<p>Tyvar caught him by the arm before he could step into a pool of necrogen, jerking him to a stop. "You gave us a fright, friend," he said. "What happened?"</p>

<p>Jace turned to stare at him, not seeming to fully see him. "The Halo cleared my head, and I<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> she's in pain," he said. "She's calling me to go to her. I have to help her. I have to help her right now! You have to let me go!"</p>

<p>Tyvar frowned, not releasing Jace. "She? Who is 'she'?"</p>

<p>"Vraska," said Jace, the name sounding like it was being dragged out of him, like there was nothing else he could have said, like it was the last thing in the world he wanted to say. "She made it down here, and she's alone and she's scared. I would—I would hear her distress anywhere."</p>

<p>The cart operators moved back to the controls, glancing to Koth for permission to depart. He nodded, and they began working the pumps, simple machines driving them up into the darkness, out of the green necrogen glow. Jace tried again to pull away from Tyvar.</p>

<p>"You have to let me <em>go</em>," he said. "I have to go to her. She needs me, and she's not going to make it if we don't help her."</p>

<p>"We have a mission—" Koth began.</p>

<p>Jace's head snapped around, eyes seeming to focus for the first time. "Vraska needs me," he snarled, then took a deep breath, calming himself. "You can go on without me. I'll help her, and we'll catch up to you together. Please."</p>

<p>"A force divided is no force at all," said Tyvar.</p>

<p>Jace looked at him, wide-eyed, like he couldn't believe his attempt at logic hadn't worked. He wrenched himself away from Tyvar, harder this time, and broke free. He began stalking across the blackened waste, not looking back.</p>

<p>"This is rash," muttered Koth.</p>

<p>"He loves her," said Elspeth. "He can't hear anything else."</p>

<p>"We can't let him go," said Nahiri. Kaya and Kaito blinked at her. She shook her head. "He has the sylex. If we lose that, we lose everything. We may as well not have come. We could have stayed home, worried about our own planes, and let the remains of Mirrodin burn." The group set out after Jace, abandoning their safe route through the Dross Pits. The plan, while not yet forgotten, was crumbling in their hands, and would fall apart completely if they didn't find a way to get it back on track soon.</p>

<p>They followed Jace's lead, a clustered group of Planeswalkers and Mirrans.</p>

<p>"This is a terrible idea," muttered Kaito. "I have plenty of terrible ideas, but they don't usually get everybody around me dead. But Jace has <em>special</em> bad ideas, I guess."</p>

<p>Still, he walked with the others, and not one of them looked back.</p>

<hr />

<p>At first, it seemed they had the blasted, necrogen-blotched landscape to themselves. Then warring figures began to appear, shells of blackened metal barely containing raw red sinew and exposed bone, limbs jutting from every surface of their bodies, weapons like rough-hewn cleavers designed for splitting powerful exoskeletons. Some were small, scaled to match the Planeswalkers, while others towered over them, massive colossi of metal and viscera.</p>

<p>Most of them echoed the Dross Pits, shells black and blistered from their caustic environment, while others glowed red-hot, superheated metallic forms cutting through their opponents as they fought onward. Urabrask's rebellion was well underway.</p>

<p>The Phyrexian forces made Elspeth's stomach turn. She recognized the echoes of shapes she had fought beside in the war for Mirrodin, the arms of a viridian elf, the powerful chest of a loxodon. Other aspects of their forms were entirely new, making them all the more unsettling. Every time she thought she knew what she was looking at, she would spot something else that turned it strange and unfamiliar. It hurt to look too closely.</p>

<p>For the moment, the Phyrexians seemed consumed by their battle with each other, their heavy feet churning at the metallic landscape and sloshing through the necrogen pools. It wasn't until one of the fights tumbled past at only a short remove that Elspeth realized what was happening. Her eyes widened, head snapping around to focus on Jace.</p>

<p>"You're shielding us from them," she said.</p>

<p>"When they look at us, they see nothing at all," he said. "It's not a shield. It's a full change to their environment." The strain was evident in his voice. "This is the fastest way to get to Vraska. She's so afraid, and she's all alone."</p>

<p>A vast, terrible structure loomed out of the rotting clouds of fog, as blackened and decayed as everything around it, sheltered by the terrible "wings" of a ribcage too large to have ever belonged to any living thing. Kaya made a small sound of disgust. Koth made a larger sound of dismay. Kaito glanced to them, eyebrows raised.</p>

<p>"Sheoldred's Coliseum," said Koth. "She makes them fight there, for her amusement."</p>

<p>"'Them'?" asked Kaito blankly.</p>

<p>"Phyrexians. Champions or those who have displeased her, it doesn't matter, they go in, and most don't come out again. Sometimes she takes our people there, when they're captured alive and deemed unworthy of the 'gifts' of Phyrexia." Koth shook his head, looking more revolted by the instant. "No one exits the coliseum alive and unchanged. I escaped. Mostly. Part of me will fight there until I die."</p>

<p>"Vraska," said Jace, and broke again into a run, Nahiri and Kaya close behind—Nahiri following the sylex, Kaya following Nahiri.</p>

<p>"If his illusions go with him, the forces of New Phyrexia will see us soon," said Tyvar. He sounded nervous for once. In unspoken agreement, he and the others ran after Jace. The coliseum gates were unbarred, so narrow the group was forced to enter single file. Jace was first through, Nahiri and Kaya close behind.</p>

<p>The others didn't even make it inside before they heard Nahiri swearing and the telltale sound of metal ripping itself out of the ground as the lithomancer prepared for war. They exchanged a glance and hurried their steps, unlimbering their weapons as they moved.</p>

<p>Kaito grabbed Elspeth's arm before she could enter. "We can't do this," he said. "Jace is our friend, but this is foolishness. We have to recover the sylex and keep moving."</p>

<p>Elspeth looked at him as levelly as she could manage. "What's the value of fighting at all, if we can't even make the stand to save our own?" she asked.</p>

<p>Looking chagrined, he let go.</p>

<p>Elspeth turned back to the entrance and stepped into Sheoldred's Coliseum.</p>

<p>The interior was a vast, gutted-out bowl surrounded by high ranks of backless seating, so steep that there was little doubt that eager spectators could tumble from the heights if they weren't careful. A pitted black-metal floor stretched through the center of the bowl, a pool of bubbling necrogen visible at its center and around the edges. It was a pit of horrors.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align:right;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/csqA19hvW0.jpg" />

</p></div></div>

<p>And in the bowl, bleeding profusely from a dozen terrible wounds, stood Vraska. The gorgon had one hand clasped against her midsection, blood trickling between her fingers as she held some essential piece of herself inside. The serpentine tendrils atop her head hung limp, and a ring of Phyrexians closed in on her, stepping over the petrified bodies of their fellows.</p>

<p>Those weren't the only bodies on the ground: fully a dozen Mirrans had been slaughtered before things reached this point. Elspeth couldn't help thinking, as she looked at them, that at least they had died without being compleated; it had been clean and quick.</p>

<p>Jace was heading straight for Vraska, trusting his illusions to protect him. The Phyrexians still didn't see him, but that wouldn't last forever. Passing like ghosts on a battlefield was one thing. Stepping between a predator and their prey was something else altogether. Kaito raised his sword as Elspeth drew hers. Tyvar pulled the hex of black metal from his belt and spun it between his fingers, skin rippling into a new composition as he borrowed its innate nature for himself.</p>

<p>Koth sighed, shoulders slumping. "So we're doing this," he said, before shouting grimly, "<em>For Mirrodin</em>!" He charged, stony armor turning white-hot as he activated it. He grabbed a pike dropped by one of the fallen as he ran, the heat spreading along the weapon's metal shaft, until he held a superheated rod.</p>

<p>The others were only a beat behind. Nahiri's blades spun a whirling song of death in the air around her, cutting down two of the remaining Phyrexians before they could finish turning. Kaya moved to advance, and Nahiri whirled on her, eyes blazing.</p>

<p>"No," she snapped. "If that fool wants to get himself killed, we're depending on <em>you</em>. Without one of you, we're finished. You stay back."</p>

<p>Kaya had never been afraid of Nahiri before. She looked her in the eyes, and felt her skin crawl, sudden dread washing over her. She stepped back and watched as the others engaged the Phyrexians.</p>

<p>The Phyrexians turned away from Vraska, distracted by the Planeswalkers, though still not seeing Jace, who continued his single-minded race for the gorgon. Kaito raised his sword to block a blow from one of the armored creatures, Himoto beeping warning, and staggered from the force of the impact. Tyvar was suddenly there, shoving himself between Kaito and the next swing of the creature's sword, grunting as it slammed into his own metal-plated back.</p>

<p>It barely even dented the surface. His grin was wild as he swung his weapon at the beast. Behind him, Kaito cocked his head. The sheet of glistening Phyrexian oil the blow had left on Tyvar's transformed skin peeled off and rolled into a ball, floating in the air above Tyvar's head.</p>

<p>Koth battered the Phyrexians with his superheated fists, aiming for the breaks in their armor, the joints and open places, sidestepping their weapons. One of the Phyrexians—a terrible thing that looked like a metallic lobster constructed by welding a dozen or more smaller humanoid corpses into a single shape—roared and tried to stab him with a vicious semi-crustacean claw. Koth caught it right before it could jam the tip into his armor, straining to hold it away from himself.</p>

<p>A strike of Elspeth's sword sundered the claw, radiant golden light shining from the blow. Koth grinned at her as she continued to swing, decapitating the beast. Then he turned and flung the claw into the next combatant in the line, driving the barb through its throat. The fighter blinked once, looking almost comically surprised, and then collapsed, lifeless and limp.</p>

<p>The ball of oil Kaito had created suddenly accelerated, splashing into the eyes of the nearest Phyrexian. The big figure staggered backward, momentarily blinded, and that was all the opening Tyvar needed to strike it down. He kicked the body as it fell, turning back to Kaito.</p>

<p>"Well aimed!"</p>

<p>"I cheat," said Kaito, with a shrug.</p>

<p>Through it all, Nahiri moved forward in a cloud of whirling metal, a terrible dealer of endless destruction. The remaining Phyrexians never stood a chance against her, much less against the strength of the gathered Planeswalkers. The last of them fell as her knives returned to neutral in the air around her, and as Jace finally reached Vraska, who took a step backward, away from him, her free hand raised to ward him off.</p>

<p>He stopped, staring at her with shocked eyes that still glowed faintly blue from the effort of keeping himself hidden from Phyrexia. "Vraska?" he said, not bothering to keep the hurt out of his voice. "Vraska, we have Elspeth with us. We have Halo. We have Melira. She can cure phyresis. We can patch your wounds. It's not as bad as you think it is<nbsp> . . .</nbsp>"</p>

<p>"No," said Vraska, normally steady voice hollowed out and gutted. "No, Jace, no. I'm so sorry I called you here. I didn't mean to. We were linked, and you—you shouldn't have heard that."</p>

<p>Jace blinked, taking a step toward her. "What? No. Calling me was the right thing to do, and you're safe now, you're safe, we <em>saved</em> you—"</p>

<p>"<em>No</em>!" All Vraska's missing strength returned for a single, forceful syllable. She staggered, sagged, looked at him, somehow smaller than she should have been, somehow<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> <em>reduced</em>. "You didn't save me, Jace. You can't. You were too late. It's inside me. Phyrexia is a poison even I can't fight off. It's too late."</p>

<p>Jace stared at her, openly horrified. Melira bit her lip.</p>

<p>"I can feel it from here," she said, quietly. "The fact that she's still this much herself<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> she must have a will that could move mountains. If she weren't so badly wounded, maybe, but as it stands<nbsp> . . .</nbsp>"</p>

<p>Nahiri stepped forward, knives following. "We can give you a clean exit," she said, voice devoid of all feeling. "We can let you die as yourself."</p>

<p>"I will kill you if you touch her," Jace snarled, taking his eyes off Vraska long enough to shoot a glare at Nahiri.</p>

<p>Nahiri stopped, looking at him dispassionately. Jace turned back to Vraska.</p>

<p>"Please," he said. "We can at least <em>try</em>. We can<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> we have to do <em>something</em>."</p>

<p>"You have to run," said Vraska. "All of you. Run now, while there's a chance this works out the way we meant it to. We knew there might be losses. We knew there <em>would</em> be losses. Run. Run, Jace Beleren, and don't look back. Please. I love you. Don't let me loving you be the thing that destroys you. Go. Save the Multiverse, and live. That would make me happy."</p>

<p>"I won't leave you," said Jace.</p>

<p>"The rest of us will," said Kaito. "Jace, you can stay with Vraska if that's what you want to do. You're allowed to make your own choices. But you can't do it with the sylex."</p>

<p>Nahiri snapped her fingers. Her knives darted forward, slicing through the straps of Jace's pack before he had a chance to react, and Kaya snatched it before it could hit the ground, clutching it to her chest as she backed off again.</p>

<p>"You're just giving up on her?" Jace looked hopelessly from face to face, people he'd known and fought beside for years, people he barely knew at all. "Elspeth, you came here to be a beacon of hope—"</p>

<p>"For everyone," said Elspeth. "Phyrexia doesn't let people go."</p>

<p>"Jace, please," said Vraska. "It's over for me. Let me have this." She paused, a faint smile tracing her lips. "I never expected to die anything but alone."</p>

<p>"You're <em>not</em> dying alone," snapped Jace, turning back to her. "You're not dying."</p>

<p>"But I am," said Vraska.</p>

<p>Neither of them seemed to notice as the other Planeswalkers fled the coliseum, leaving them behind, Kaya holding the sylex tight. They were lost in their own world.</p>

<p>Then Jace stepped closer, and this time, Vraska didn't retreat, not even as he reached for her bloodied hands and took them in his own.</p>

<p>"Close your eyes," he said.</p>

<p>Vraska obliged.</p>

<hr />

<p>The group forced themselves through the tight passage single file, emerging into the blackened, rotting landscape outside the coliseum, leaving Vraska and Jace behind.</p>

<p>They stepped straight into the middle of a war.</p>

<p>The fight inside the coliseum had been anything but quiet. They had killed and screamed and shouted for each other without consideration for the fact that they might be overheard. With Jace still inside, there was nothing concealing them from the combatants on the field, most of whom were no longer scattered, but had come together outside the coliseum. They had arranged themselves in ranks ranging from multi-legged, human-size creatures to hulking constructs of sinew and bone.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align:right;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/ND2jDwhj23Dw.jpg" />

</p></div></div>

<p>The Planeswalkers and Mirrans stared. They had exhausted so much of their strength on the fight to save Vraska. Patches of skin were starting to show through Tyvar's metal shell, and the knives around Nahiri swirled a little more slowly.</p>

<p>They couldn't go back without backing themselves into a dead end. They couldn't press forward without clearing the field.</p>

<p>Elspeth reached for Koth's hand, squeezing his fingers, trying to take comfort in the fact that they had done everything they could. They might fail here, they might fall here, but they had tried.</p>

<p>"For Mirrodin?" she asked, resigned to the fight.</p>

<p>The big man nodded. "<em>For Mirrodin</em>!" he roared, and they surged forward, a wave destined to break upon the rocks, fighting to the last.</p>

<hr />

<p>"You can open your eyes now," said Jace.</p>

<p>Vraska blinked as she turned to look around. The coliseum was gone, replaced by a sundrenched Ravnican avenue, the sky above them perfect and cloudless as it so rarely was. She glanced back to Jace, startled, and blinked again. All signs of battle were gone, along with all signs of battle readiness. Instead, he was dressed for an afternoon stroll, hair almost tamed into behaving itself, and offering her his hand.</p>

<p>"I may not be able to save you from Phyrexia, but I can spend one more day with you first," he said. "Let me give you this."</p>

<p>"Jace," she said, voice cracking into a laugh as he took her hand and pulled her close to him, and everything was wonderful, and nothing was wrong.</p>

<p>She could almost pretend she believed in this illusion it was so all-consuming. They wandered the streets of Ravnica, visiting guild halls and great museums, and she let her head rest on his shoulder, lost in his dream of the future they could have had together, had the Multiverse been just a little kinder.</p>

<p>She gripped his hand tight in this version of her perfect world—<em>their</em> perfect world. "Thank you," she whispered. "It's wonderful."</p>

<p>"I love you," he said.</p>

<p>Vraska grimaced. "It's time for you to go. Otherwise, I fear that when Phyrexia reaches my mind, I'll harm you. Please. For what we could have been, do this for me."</p>

<p>"No. I won't leave you. I can save your mind, in here, at least. We can stay together, in a place Phyrexia can't touch—" The sky above them began to darken. "Oh, Jace," she said, voice becoming a sigh as she reached his name. "Don't feel bad. You always need to be the hero who finds the answer, but sometimes there isn't one. If you'd just been a little bit faster<nbsp> . . .</nbsp>"</p>

<p>If Elspeth and Kaya had made it down from the surface sooner—if he hadn't chosen to wait for them—if he hadn't allowed Nahiri to bait him into an argument in the Mirran camp.</p>

<p>If.</p>

<p>"It's not too late," he said.</p>

<p>"But it is." She touched the side of his face. "It's in you, too. You're already lost."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Here in the Dross Pits, the oil that spreads the infection hangs in the air above the necrogen pools. You should have run, my brave, foolish boy." She shook her head. "You're as doomed as I am."</p>

<p>"I took Halo before we reached you. I have time. <em>We </em>have time."</p>

<p>Jace sighed, moving closer. Vraska leaned in to meet him, and their lips met, one last kiss shared in the shadow of the end.</p>

<p>He tasted the lies on her lips as something stabbed the palm of his right hand, burning like ice, and the illusion he had so carefully constructed shattered around them, leaving them back under the blasted Phyrexian sky. Jace tried to jerk away. Vraska held him fast, their hands still joined, and smiled as sweet as anything.</p>

<p>"For the glory of Phyrexia," she purred.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align:right;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/LLoE9puqpH.jpg" />

</p></div></div>

<p>She had grown a long, curving tail like a scorpion's, barbed at the end. That was what had struck him, delivering a hearty dose of glistening oil. She laughed, eyes flashing as she unleashed her gaze upon him for the first time. Jace raised his burning arm to cover his face, turned, and ran, fleeing from the Phyrexian who knew him better than anyone.</p>

<p>Her laughter followed him as he ran straight into Tyvar's metal side. The elf was retreating through the entrance, the others with him, fleeing a closing onslaught of Phyrexian forces.</p>

<p>Vraska was still laughing. They were going to die here. All of them.</p>

<p>Nahiri hissed through her teeth as she swung her sword at a hulking brute. "We're done!" she shouted. The bandage on her neck had come loose at some point in the fight, flapping with her movements. She reached back and ripped it free, revealing an odd, bony growth over her spine. She didn't seem to care who saw as she spun back to face the others.</p>

<p>"There's no winning here," she said. "The mission only goes forward if we move <em>on</em>. So you're moving on. Hold on to something."</p>

<p>Her magic rose like a burning tide as she reached deep enough to set the air dancing in a heat-haze of visible convection. Nahiri's power seemed inexhaustible, relentless. One by one, the knives she had painstakingly called from the substance of the layer dropped, inert, to the ground, as the sword in her hand blazed brighter. The coliseum around her began to warp and crack, unable to resist her inexorable call.</p>

<p>The bony growth on her spine was spreading, as if ripping this much power out of Phyrexia itself was hastening some terrible transformation. Her skin began to fissure, revealing deep veins of burning red where blood should have been.</p>

<p>She met Jace's eyes across the broken battlefield, her own eyes now black from side to side, like extinguished coals. "Don't let this be for nothing," she said. "Finish the job."</p>

<p>She swung her sword, and in that moment, she was a figure out of legend; in that moment, she could have cleaved the plane. And then, with a vast and terrible shattering, she did precisely that, and everything fell into darkness.</p>

<hr />

<p>Dust clogged the air, blackened with necrogen and bright with impossible radiance. Bit by bit, it cleared away.</p>

<p>Elspeth sat up, hacking, and pushed a large piece of debris off her torso before scrambling onto hands and knees, looking frantically around for the others. The impact of her body with the porcelain ground had smashed her pack, and she had to fight the urge to weep at the sight of her precious remaining Halo seeping into the ground and dissipating into rainbow mist.</p>

<p>Not that it had done them much good so far. They were losing. They were going to die here—if they were lucky. If they were unlucky, they were going to become terrible new tools in Phyrexia's arsenal and carry destruction across the planes.</p>

<p>No. No, she couldn't think that way. She pushed herself to her feet, looking around, and was relieved to see Koth picking himself out of the rubble. He looked up, jaw hanging slightly open. "That majestic <em>fool</em>," he breathed.</p>

<p>"What?" asked Elspeth.</p>

<p>He pointed. "Look."</p>

<p>She looked up. There was a vast hole in the silvered sky, dark and jagged, like someone had smashed their way through.</p>

<p>"She dropped the whole coliseum into the Fair Basilica," he said. "Incredible."</p>

<p>The others were picking their way out of the rubble, Tyvar helping Kaito to his feet, Kaya assisting Jace. Elspeth was relieved to see that the pack containing the sylex had fared better than her own; it was still apparently intact.</p>

<p>Nahiri was nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p>Above them, Phyrexians began pouring from the hole, almost immediately joining in battle against one another. They didn't fall, but clung to the silver surface of the sky, ignoring gravity in favor of carnage. More Phyrexians boiled up the walls, these ones shelled in shining silver and white, marking them as denizens of the Fair Basilica.</p>

<p>Elspeth turned her head and gasped. The others followed her gaze. There, bright against the artificial horizon, was the gleaming, wide-winged form of Atraxa, fighting against the blackened invaders to her master's domain.</p>

<p>"We must move," said Koth. "This battle will keep Elesh Norn's forces distracted for a time, but not forever."</p>

<p>"And I don't have forever," said Jace. He held up his arm, blistered and burnt from Vraska's venom, skin splitting in fissures to reveal tissue gleaming with a slick brightness that had nothing to do with blood. "The Halo in my system will slow it, but not stop it."</p>

<p>"Melira," said Elspeth.</p>

<p>The petite Mirran shook her head. "He'd be incapacitated, and we'd never get him back to the surface," she said. "I can't do it here."</p>

<p>Jace looked entirely unsurprised. "Kaya, give me back the sylex. I'm not going to survive this as it stands, I may as well be the one to trigger the blast."</p>

<p>"If you think that's a sales pitch, you've lost your damn mind," said Kaya, clutching the pack protectively.</p>

<p>"We can argue while we walk," said Koth. "We're close to the altar. Your lithomancer friend has driven us to our goal, and we shouldn't let her sacrifice be in vain."</p>

<p>"I can't believe I'm living in a world where Nahiri saved me," said Jace. He glanced at his arm, mouth twisting. "But then again, guess I won't have to."</p>

<p>They began to move, picking their way across the rubble-strewn path toward the towering shape of Norn's altar.</p>

<p>Jace continued whispering to Kaya, trying to convince her to hand him the bag, until finally, with a disgusted expression, she shoved it into his arms and stalked ahead, body flashing purple as she phased through the largest chunks of rubble. Jace let the bag rest against his hip, looking neither pleased nor displeased; the loss of Vraska and his own future in the same blow seemed to have broken something inside him, and the despair in his eyes was a blow to Elspeth's heart. She couldn't look at him for long.</p>

<p>They had lost two of their number—three if she already included Jace on that list—and all the Halo. They were trapped in the heart of New Phyrexia, with no clear way home.</p>

<p>How much did they really have left to lose?</p>

<p>Under the burning sky of the Fair Basilica and the corrupted light of Atraxa, they continued.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Assault on New Phyrexia | Episode 2: Unstable Foundations</title><link>https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/magic-story/assault-on-new-phyrexia-or-episode-2-unstable-foundations</link><guid>https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/magic-story/assault-on-new-phyrexia-or-episode-2-unstable-foundations</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>Static, and screaming, and the sensation of falling forever.</p>

<p>Elspeth had awakened alone on the soil of New Phyrexia, gripped by fear of the worst. They had clearly fallen into a trap. Was she the only one spared, once more a prisoner of Phyrexia?</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align:right;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/YxB9DZIMFw.jpg" />

</p></div></div>

<p>The thought barely had time to form before a cluster of Phyrexians charged over the crest of the hill. Elspeth grabbed her sword and rose to meet the threat, grateful they hadn't arrived while she was unconscious. She could so easily have been overwhelmed; the greatest warrior falls when caught off guard.</p>

<p>Or when outnumbered. There were six of them to one of her, and they knew the terrain where she didn't. She still cut three of them down before she found herself losing ground. The first Phyrexian had nicked her arm, and the fear returned, hotter this time, telling her the battle might not go in her favor.</p>

<p>That was when a purple-tinged blade thrust through a Phyrexian heart, telling her she wasn't the only survivor and, more, wasn't fighting alone.</p>

<p>Kaya's presence quickly turned the tide in their favor, allowing them to emerge unscathed, Elspeth nearly frantic while checking Kaya for injuries. She was immune, but Kaya wasn't, and there was no such thing as too much care on Phyrexia.</p>

<p>Exposure was a death sentence. They all knew it. The risks had been one of the first things explained when the Phyrexian threat was discovered. There were ways to escape that inevitability, but they were rare, costly, or both. Halo <em>might</em> be one, but their supply was limited, and they had yet to test it in the field. It was too much to hope that Melira would still be alive and able to help them.</p>

<p>Still, knowing a thing and accepting it were very different, and Elspeth couldn't be sure Kaya had fully internalized the danger she was in.</p>

<p>"You okay?" said Kaya. Elspeth gave her a short nod.</p>

<p>With the fight done, the pair had moved onward to the Mirran camp, where a troll named Thrun had been able to break a hole in the shell of the plane and drop a rope ladder they could use to reach the surface of old Mirrodin. From there, they had continued toward the white lacuna, the original opening to Mirrodin's core, that would now take them to the Furnace Layer. No other members of their company had appeared to join them.</p>

<p>Elspeth only hoped, wild and somewhat unfounded, that when they reached the bottom, they would find the others.</p>

<p>Her gloom was evident as they walked. Kaya would have been willfully in denial to miss it. "It can't be too much farther from here, sunshine," she said, using the variable gravity of the lacuna to walk along the wall. "We both landed okay. A little bumpy, but we're fine. We'll find the others. You'll see."</p>

<p>"At least you didn't wake up with Phyrexian forces coming to separate you from your head."</p>

<p>"No, just with this little guy shaking me." Kaya caressed the head of the small, tanuki-shaped robot that rode on her shoulder. It wasn't Mirran <em>or</em> Phyrexian in origin; Elspeth would have guessed Kamigawan. It must have belonged to someone from one of the other strike teams. It was lucky it had landed with Kaya. Much longer on its own, and Phyrexia would have already found a way inside.</p>

<p>Elspeth, who was familiar with the lacunae from her time on Mirrodin during the war, walked more sedately, trying to stay ahead of her own thoughts, which turned down bleaker paths than she preferred. She'd known coming back here would be hard, but seeing what it had become, how much had been lost—it was brutal.</p>

<p>New Phyrexia seemed like a plane built for regretting. Maybe it ached less for Kaya, who had never seen Mirrodin, who knew they walked through a graveyard, but not the volume of the blood that tainted every surface. It was easier, in some ways, to walk the ashes of a battle that had never been yours.</p>

<p>The lacuna stretched on and on, longer than would have been possible without the nurturing magic that wept from its walls, sustaining and reinforcing it. When they reached the bottom, they may as well have reached the top; they had followed the line of the anchoring magic far enough that gravity reversed itself again, forcing them to grab the rungs protruding from the walls and climb the last ten or so feet to the opening.</p>

<p>Pulling herself onto the lacuna's rim, Elspeth held tight as she beheld the Furnace Layer. Below her, she could hear Kaya's near-effortless ascent, and she shifted slightly to the side. "Hold on when you get out here," she called down. "The last of the magic will escort us to the ground as soon as we let go."</p>

<p>"Escort us to the—oh. Of course, we're popping out of the ceiling," grumbled Kaya. "Did the Mirrans not believe in dependable gravity?"</p>

<p>"This <em>is</em> dependable gravity. It's just dependable in a different way."</p>

<p>Kaya boosted herself up next to Elspeth, looked around, and let out a long, low whistle. It wasn't an unreasonable reaction.</p>

<p>True to its name, the Furnace Layer <em>burned</em>. Magma teemed all around them, and the air was swelteringly hot. Shelves of pyroclastic rock served as solid ground, and somehow the thermoclines of the burning pools didn't make it unbearable, merely uncomfortable. Life could, impossibly, survive here.</p>

<p>Below them, on one of the largest pyroclastic shelves, a haphazard Mirran structure jutted from the landscape. An array of tents and makeshift pavilions surrounded its edges, soot-dark and constructed to blend into the earth around them, nothing too large for a single person to tear down in the blink of an eye. People moved between them, dwindled by distance and reduced to broad strokes of physicality.</p>

<p>Kaya glanced to Elspeth.</p>

<p>"Mirran?"</p>

<p>"Phyrexians don't build tents."</p>

<p>"Think our missing folks will be down there?"</p>

<p>"If they're not, I think this is already over," replied Elspeth, and—heart in her throat and somehow hammering in her chest at the same time—she let go.</p>

<p>The lacuna's magic caught her before she could fall more than a few feet and carried her to the ground as lightly as a mother's hand, Kaya floating beside her and laughing under her breath.</p>

<p>By the time their feet touched the surface, a crowd had begun to gather. The people who had emerged to meet them gleamed gold with metallic embellishments but lacked the slick perfection of true Phyrexians: this was the force they had come seeking.</p>

<p>"Elspeth!" shouted a voice from the crowd, deep, rough, and rumbling—a voice like a mountain, unexpected and familiar. Elspeth stiffened before delight overwhelmed her, and she broke into the broadest grin she had ever worn, spinning around and launching herself toward the speaker.</p>

<p>"Koth!" she cried. "Koth, I thought you were dead!"</p>

</p></div></div>

<p>The larger Planeswalker caught her around the waist and swung her around, both laughing, bright with a levity that seemed to have little place in this burning terrain, in this bleakest of times. He was an imposing, dark-skinned man whose body was plated with stony armor, and the contrast between him and the slighter—though not much shorter—Elspeth was marked.</p>

<p>Kaya looked around, her own demeanor shifting toward relaxation when she spotted a face in the crowd. "Tyvar," she said, smiling as she walked over to him. "Should have known you'd find your way here before us."</p>

<p>He laughed. "And <em>I</em> should have known there was no sense in worrying about you! Skies above, you'd be someone else entirely if you didn't fall into danger at the slightest opportunity."</p>

<p>"Woke up alone with somebody else's equipment on the ground around me, and sunshine there"—Kaya hooked a thumb toward Elspeth, who was still laughing and hugging Koth—"just a little ways away. Both of us got hit, hard, crossing over. Did you—?"</p>

<p>"I fear we all did," said Tyvar, face falling. "Not everyone has managed to find their way to us. Jace was the last to come before you, and he arrived alone, having made his own path over the surface."</p>

<p>"Jace<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> ?"</p>

<p>"Is behind you," said Jace's familiar, measured voice.</p>

<p>Kaya huffed a breath. "You just wanted to see if I would jump," she accused mildly, turning to face him.</p>

<p>The slender telepath shrugged. "You never do, so it seems pointless to try," he said, and smiled, just a little. "Hello, Kaya. I was worried we had lost you."</p>

<p>"Couldn't you have, you know." She tapped her temple. "You set up the mindlink before we left. You should have just been able to give me a jingle."</p>

<p>The faint smile that had been forming fled Jace's face. "The barrier broke that link, along with so many other things. I haven't been able to reach any of the other teams. Those you see here are all that we've managed to recover of the strike force."</p>

<p>Kaya frowned. "Vraska? Nissa? The Wanderer? Lukka?"</p>

<p>"Vraska wasn't with us when we woke," he said. "Nissa was, but even as we gathered ourselves and prepared for our journey, a trap shunted her away—as if she had somehow been forced to planeswalk again."</p>

<p>"We think our group may have encountered something similar," said Nahiri, stepping out of the crowd with Kaito close behind. Jace looked at her coolly but made no comment.</p>

<p>Kaya's frown deepened. It was no secret that there was no love lost between Jace and Nahiri. She had been counting on those who knew them better to be the barrier between them and had no real interest in being tapped for the job. "How do you mean?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Hey!" Kaito interjected, before anyone could answer. "Those are mine! Pompon!"</p>

<p>"These?" Kaya touched the blade she had tied to her hip with a length of rope, even as the little bot on her shoulder leapt over to Kaito's and clung, chittering happily. "They were near me when I woke up. They're yours?"</p>

<p>"Can't you tell? They're not Phyrexian," said Kaito, extending his hand. He looked exhausted. They all did, to one degree or another.</p>

<p>"Now that you mention it, yeah. Too fancy for me anyway," said Kaya, untying the blade and slapping the hilt into Kaito's palm. He visibly relaxed, flashing her a grateful smile before he turned his attention to the little robot on his shoulder, murmuring a quiet greeting. It chittered back, obviously home.</p>

<p>Looking much more relaxed, Kaito turned back to Kaya. "No clue about Lukka. The Wanderer was with us when we arrived," he said. "Her spark is always a little<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> unpredictable, but she can normally keep it under a semblance of control. This time, she flickered for a long while before she departed for the Blind Eternities."</p>

<p>"You might have been able to shift yourself into phase with her and tell us what she was trying to say before she vanished," said Nahiri. Kaya had never tried to use her magic in that specific manner but nodded anyway. "It might have been possible. Did Nissa look like she was hurt by whatever happened?"</p>

<p>"No," said Jace, with audible misery. "She was simply gone. The Phyrexians were more prepared for our assault than we had hoped they would be."</p>

<p>"I'm sure she's fine," said Nahiri brusquely. "That elf's a hard weed to pull. We need to figure out what the plan looks like with this many of us gone."</p>

<p>Suddenly uncomfortable, Kaya returned her attention to Jace, lifting an eyebrow. "Well?"</p>

<p>"Well," he said. "The plan hasn't changed. The plan <em>can't</em> change. We're down half our number, but we knew the odds would be against us. If we don't get the sylex to the base of their World Tree before it connects through the Blind Eternities, all the planes will share Mirrodin's fate."</p>

<p>Tyvar scowled. "You mean their corrupt mockery of a World Tree," he said sharply.</p>

<p>Jace only shrugged.</p>

<p>"Elesh Norn calls it her Realmbreaker." Melira stepped out of the crowd, the name causing Tyvar's scowl to deepen.</p>

<p>Kaya repressed a shudder as she glanced at the blasted, blackened landscape around them. She had seen enough death, dealt enough death, to have thought there was nothing left that could truly horrify her. This, though<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> this was so much worse than anything she could have imagined. And this wasn't everything. So much of Phyrexia was still beneath them, its horrors yet to be revealed, its dangers yet to be faced.</p>

<p>"You still have the sylex," she said, half-statement, half-question. "Karn's plan can be carried out."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Jace. "We can still win."</p>

</p></div></div>

<p>"Karn?" Elspeth came pushing her way through the others, Koth close behind her. "Has there been any news?"</p>

<p>"Still lost," said Jace. "I<nbsp> . . .</nbsp>" He paused for a moment, then shook his head. "There's been no sign of either him or Ajani since we arrived here."</p>

<p>"That's likely for the best," said Elspeth, face schooled to something as close to neutrality as she could manage. "Both know far too much about the sylex. Ajani destroyed the last one."</p>

<p>"This 'sylex' is the thing you're going to use to take out Elesh Norn's Realmbreaker, right?" asked Melira.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Jace, with remarkable calm. "Planted among the roots of her World Tree—"</p>

<p>"So-called," grumbled Tyvar.</p>

<p>Jace shot him a look. "It will destroy the tree before it has an opportunity to connect this plane to the rest of the Multiverse. The Phyrexian curse will stay contained until it can be eliminated."</p>

<p>"How contained can it possibly be when it begins to infiltrate other planes already?" asked Kaito. "Kamigawa is not a cost of war."</p>

<p>"Neither is Mirrodin," said Melira. "We still fight for the plane we had, even if we'll never be able to restore what it once was. What does this sylex do to Mirrodin?"</p>

<p>"Melira, we've discussed this," said Koth.</p>

<p>"Yes, you and I have discussed this, and you love Mirrodin enough to care what happens to our home. I want someone who doesn't love our home to look me in the eye and say we'll survive." She looked at Jace. "My people have already made it through the end of our plane. Your plane doesn't matter so much more than ours that I'm going to help you sacrifice what little we have left."</p>

<p>Jace nodded slowly. "Based on my calculations, the explosion will be immense enough to destroy Realmbreaker, and presumably take out the entire Seedcore in the process, but unless the Phyrexians have destabilized the plane far beyond what the information we have indicates, that should be the whole of the damage."</p>

<p>Melira nodded. "How much do you know about what they've done to our geography?"</p>

<p>"We know the plane is layered, sphere inside of sphere, and we landed two layers higher than we meant to."</p>

<p>"You're not <em>wrong</em>," said Melira. She picked up a chunk of metallic rock from the ground, looking to Nahiri. "Hey, lithomancer, how good's your control?"</p>

<p>"Better than anyone else here," said Nahiri.</p>

<p>"Then help me out. Can you make me a little ball, about half the size of my closed fist?" She held up her free hand, fingers balled, in illustration.</p>

<p>"Toss it this way."</p>

<p>Melira lobbed the rock at Nahiri. Halfway along its arc, it froze and broke into pieces, one of them smoothing to form the requested sphere. It moved away from the rest of the debris, beginning to rotate. Melira looked pleased.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align:right;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/aYEJyRGKk0.jpg" />

</p></div></div>

<p>"This is the Seedcore," she said. "This is where we have to get you if you want to set off this sylex of yours."</p>

<p>"All right," said Jace.</p>

<p>Melira looked back to Nahiri. "Can you put a round shell around that sphere you made?"</p>

<p>"Ask for something hard," said Nahiri. A bit of debris flattened out and wrapped around the ball, forming another, larger sphere. It continued rotating.</p>

<p>"The Mycosynth Gardens," said Melira. "That's how they took us in the first place. They seeded the center of our plane with fungus that pumped Phyrexian contamination into the air, and we breathed it in without knowing. Most of us were lost before we knew there was a fight."</p>

<p>"Coward's tactics," said Tyvar.</p>

<p>"Another layer, please," said Melira, and a third sphere formed. "The Fair Basilica. That's Elesh Norn's stronghold. We're hoping Urabrask's rebellion will keep her distracted while we're passing through her territory. If not, there's no way we make it through to the Seedcore without her seeing us."</p>

<p>"More?" asked Nahiri.</p>

<p>"Please," said Melira. "Four this time, and leave a channel between each?"</p>

<p>Four more shells formed, each glowing hot for a moment before cooling and darkening to its original color. Kaya looked at Nahiri. She still looked utterly serene, like this demonstration of tightly controlled power was nothing to her. It was almost unnerving. Kaya had known Nahiri was one of the oldest Planeswalkers around, if not <em>the</em> oldest, but there was knowing and there was seeing.</p>

<p>"That outermost sphere, that's the Furnace Layer. That's where we are now. We're not safe here, but we're safer than we'll be almost anywhere else, and we've managed to connect a tunnel <em>without</em> freefall in the middle, which took some doing. Mirrans died to get you a shortcut. Respect that."</p>

<p>Melira paused, turning her face away. Her silence stretched on long enough that Koth stepped in to fill the gap. "Beneath us is the Hunter Maze, and then the Surgical Bay. We'll bypass both to land in the Dross Pits, directly above the Fair Basilica." He glanced to Elspeth. "The Dross Pits include what you used to know as the Mephidross. We'll have to watch our step there, but we should be able to make it to our next descent point without too much trouble."</p>

<p>Elspeth nodded. "This is<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> this is a nightmare," she said. "How have you survived?"</p>

<p>"Two more layers above us—you've seen those," said Melira. "What you may not have realized is that the layer overhead, the one we call Mirrex, is all that remains of our original plane. They gutted it to build their own."</p>

<p>"As to our survival, it's a close thing," said Koth. "Food is in short supply. Drinkable water, even moreso. The elves are all but gone. I haven't seen an uncompleated vedalken in years. We fight the battles we can, we save the people we can, and we never stop moving for long. Mirrodin was—is—a plane of steel. Mirrodin's people reflect that. As long as one of us is breathing, we'll keep fighting back."</p>

<p>Elspeth nodded again, more slowly this time. "I'm sorry I left you for so long."</p>

<p>"Don't be," he said. "Knowing I saved you, even if I couldn't save so many—it helped."</p>

<p>"So our plane matters," said Melira, and gestured toward the rotating sphere as Nahiri added two more layers to signify Mirrex and the Monumental Facade. "Our fight matters. Your fight matters too, or we wouldn't be helping you—no other plane should see this fate."</p>

<p>"Agreed," said Tyvar, sounding subdued.</p>

<p>"Agreed," echoed Kaito.</p>

<p>One by one, the other Planeswalkers chimed in their understanding, and the nearby Mirrans did the same.</p>

<p>Melira looked at Jace, eyes hard. "So now that you know what our internal geography looks like, are you still sure we're going to survive what you're planning to do?"</p>

<p>Jace hesitated for a long moment before he sighed and said, "No. No, I'm not. When Urza used the first sylex, it broke things we didn't know could be broken. But we don't have any time to spare coming up with a new plan. We shouldn't even wait for the others."</p>

<p>"I don't know about you, but I'm not into the idea of giving Elesh Norn time to finish her plan. We have to take out that tree before it connects through the Blind Eternities, or the shockwave could be unthinkable. We could lose a lot more than Mirrodin," said Kaya.</p>

<p>Nahiri looked to Jace. "These people have no idea what they're helping us to do," she said, voice low.</p>

<p>Melira turned to him. "What does she think you're not telling us?"</p>

<p>Jace grimaced, looked away before responding. "We're setting off a bomb in the center of the plane. The shockwave <em>should</em> travel along the tree and destroy it without harming Mirrodin, but it's not like we can test it. Our assumptions about the stability of Mirrodin couldn't take into account the sheer amount of restructuring you've shown us." He indicated Nahiri's sphere, still rotating despite her departure. She hadn't gone far.</p>

<p>"So this could still destroy us."</p>

<p>"If I say yes, will you refuse to help?"</p>

<p>"If you'd said no, I would have refused to help," said Melira. "Koth's a geomancer, not a lithomancer—he says there's a difference, I wouldn't know—and the land speaks to him where the stone lingers. He told me there was a chance this could destabilize our plane. It's worth the risk to save the rest of the Multiverse, as long as you don't lie about it."</p>

<p>Kaya nodded. This was a graveyard of ash and steel, and it deserved to be respected while they used it to achieve their goals. What they were here to do might destroy Mirrodin forever, and it was hard to see that as a bad thing, if there was a chance it would also eliminate the Phyrexian threat to the Multiverse. There would be a shockwave when the sylex was detonated, that much was unquestionable. But if the World Tree had yet to connect through the Blind Eternities, the shock would have nowhere else to go. It might rip this plane apart.</p>

<p>"Then we move," said Jace. "The Mirran forces have agreed to contribute their spare gear if anyone needs additional weapons, or armor. Phyrexian oil doesn't need to break the skin to infect."</p>

<p>Koth moved forward. "Our gear has been treated with a substance we call hexgold. It's rare and precious, but it offers some small measure of protection from phyresis, and it increases the strength of a weapon against the compleated. More is available to treat the equipment you brought with you."</p>

<p>"This is something new," said Elspeth. "Where does it come from?"</p>

<p>"A final gift from Mirrodin," said Koth. "We make the journey upward to Mirrex, and we scavenge the remaining plates from the Glimmervoid. Treating the plates with blinkmoth serum refines the metal into hexgold and lets us use it to protect ourselves."</p>

<p>"Is there any way I could obtain a piece of this 'Glimmervoid' metal?" asked Tyvar.</p>

<p>"Yes," said one of the Mirrans, who had been watching silently until this point. "Come with me." He motioned for Tyvar to follow him into the crowd. The man did so. After a beat to consider, Koth and Kaito did the same.</p>

<p>"We can't linger here much longer," said Melira. "We survive in the Furnace Layer at Urabrask's pleasure, and he doesn't like it when we get too comfortable."</p>

<p>Kaya frowned, looking to Jace. He inclined his head to Melira. "Of course," he said. Shifting his attention to Kaya, he said, "Urabrask is the praetor of the Quiet Furnace. He doesn't grant them shelter so much as allow them to take what they can find, and thus prevent their extinction. The chaos he creates may be the key to our success."</p>

<p>"Then we owe our thanks to a Phyrexian," said Kaya, lip curling. "That's a hard one to swallow."</p>

<p>Melira sighed. "This is an age of horrors, and everything is hard to swallow," she said. "The tunnel has been cleared out for our use, or as close to cleared as it can be—things change here, moment to moment, and what seems safe can turn in the blinking of an eye. It's good Mirran construction, and it will see us down to the Dross Pits." She indicated the rotating sphere.</p>

<p>"And if the tunnel's compromised?" asked Kaya.</p>

<p>Melira sighed. "We'd have to fight our way to the Dross Pits, and we'd never make it alive. Your plan would fail. Your Multiverse would fall. We trust the tunnel."</p>

<p>"I didn't say we shouldn't," said Kaya. "I just like to understand the details of a plan."</p>

<p>"Right; so do I," said Melira, mollified. "We descend to the Dross Pits, break into Elesh Norn's palace while her forces are elsewhere, and access the Seedcore, destroying the tree before it connects."</p>

<p>"Simple," said Kaya. "What could possibly go wrong?"</p>

<p>"Only everything," said Jace grimly, and Melira laughed.</p>

<p>"I'm going to check on the rest of you," she said, plucking Nahiri's rotating model of Mirrodin from the air and tucking it under her arm as she walked away, leaving Kaya and Jace alone.</p>

<p>Not far away, Kaito knelt, his tanuki by his side, and ran a sliver of hexgold along the edge of his blade, watching as it left gleaming specks behind. "It seems odd to hone a weapon on something that might change the steel," he said.</p>

<p>Tyvar shrugged, turning a hex of metal that shone like impossibly tarnished mercury between his fingers. "This Glimmervoid metal is like nothing I've ever encountered before," he said. He looked to the Mirran who had led them to the scant armory. "And it repels their 'glistening oil'?"</p>

<p>"It won't save you," said the Mirran, passing Tyvar a shield. "Infection can still take root, and you can still be lost. But it will make your strikes sharper and may buy you time."</p>

<p>"Time is all we need," said Tyvar.</p>

</p></div></div>

<p>Kaito smiled, shaking his head. "If the metallurgy course can wait, we need to finish preparing," he said, breaking his sword into its individual throwing stars and meticulously running the hexgold whetstone along each edge.</p>

<p>Melira stalked by, pausing to snag a small pouch of powdered hexgold as she passed.</p>

<p>"Is there a way to treat my drone?" asked Kaito.</p>

<p>Tyvar focused his attention on the other man. It was a valid question, and he wanted to know the answer, if not as much as Kaito did.</p>

<p>"The little construct can be powdered, if its gears can take the strain," said the Mirran.</p>

<p>Kaito laughed. "Dust is always a danger. She'll take the strain."</p>

<p>Not far away, Koth and Elspeth sat on rough crates, watching each other as they would a sibling believed lost—and in a way, that was precisely what they were. Born of different planes, bearers of different sparks, but siblings forged in terrible battle. A battle that was not yet done.</p>

<p>"I thought I was never going to see you again," said Elspeth.</p>

<p>"I thought the same of you," said Koth. "You are a miracle walking. But I wish you hadn't come. You fought free of this. You were to be spared. You could have gone seeking for your home, could have escaped, and instead—"</p>

<p>"I'm a warrior," said Elspeth. "I may not want to be, but I have to be a hero, to honor those who never got the chance. I have to <em>try</em>, Koth, and if I knew the danger and refused to come, I'd be no better than a coward."</p>

<p>"I understand," he said. "It's an honor to know that I'll have another chance to go down fighting beside you."</p>

<p>Elspeth managed a wan smile. "I just wish we'd had more time."</p>

<p>"That's what it means to be yourself, and not forced to become a part of the Phyrexian mass," said Koth. He rose, offering her his hand. "Come. It's almost time to go."</p>

<p>She blinked up at him as she took his hand and let him pull her to her feet. "You're coming with us?"</p>

<p>"I am," Koth confirmed. "I have a demolition team standing by to do what needs to be done if your sylex fails. You know I don't like problems with only one solution. This tree will not take root in other soil."</p>

<p>Elspeth smiled. "I'm glad to have you along. Both selfishly, and because I think our chances of success just got much, much better."</p>

<p>"You always had too much faith in me," said Koth lightly, and they walked, together, back to where the others prepared themselves for war.</p>

<p>Nahiri, who had been waiting for them to move, slipped out of the shadows and into the relative privacy of the spot where they had chosen to have their conversation. She hissed as she peeled the bandage away from her neck, revealing the blunt, hardened spike growing there.</p>

<p>"I thought so," said Melira, behind her.</p>

<p>Nahiri jumped, whirling half around to face the slim Mirran. Melira didn't flinch.</p>

<p>"There's an air to people who're still holding on to the hope that they're wrong, and you had it," she said. "Here." She reached into her pocket and tossed the pouch of hexgold to Nahiri, who caught it and looked at it blankly for a moment before frowning at Melira.</p>

<p>"You're not too far gone," said Melira. "I could treat you now, and you'd stand an excellent chance of recovery. But you'd lose days if we did that, maybe more."</p>

<p>"We don't have that kind of time," said Nahiri.</p>

<p>"That's what I thought you'd say," said Melira. "You're early enough in the process that we can wait. You have time before you're too far gone for me to pull back. Try the hexgold. If that doesn't work, you can tell me what you want to do."</p>

<p>The spike on Nahiri's neck was covered by a layer of what felt like ordinary skin; calling a razored bit of shale into her hand, she sliced through that thin veil of tissue, cutting until she hit something hard that she hoped—truly hoped—was bone. Reaching up with her other hand, she sprinkled the powdered hexgold over the wound she had created. The skin spasmed, and she felt a bubble form, expelling the hexgold from her body. With a convulsive itch, the skin knit back together; she touched it experimentally, and found no seam, no blood, only a faint gritty film of hexgold.</p>

<p>Face betraying nothing, Nahiri plastered the bandage back down and looked to Melira. "It didn't work," she said. "You say you can fix me?"</p>

<p>"I can," said Melira. "But if I do<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> it's a hard healing for the body to go through. You'll be out of commission for days."</p>

<p>"You can't hurry it along?"</p>

<p>"That <em>is</em> hurrying it along. Your body's already fighting as hard as it can. That helps me. But we'll lose you for a while. Can we win this without you?"</p>

<p>Nahiri was silent, but her tightly drawn expression was answer enough. No. No, they couldn't. She was the strongest mage they had, and more, she was in a plane all but designed to respond to her magic. They needed her. "After everything I've done for the Multiverse, this shouldn't be how it ends," she said. "It's not right."</p>

<p>"And this won't be how it ends," said Melira. She tossed the sphere she had been carrying to Nahiri. It stopped halfway between them, resuming its slow rotation. "You're strong. You're fighting this. Now you'll fight harder for Mirrodin, and for your own future."</p>

<p>Nahiri nodded slowly. "And if I'm already infected, I can show these Phyrexian assholes how much damage a daughter of Zendikar can do before they knock me down."</p>

<p>"Good," said Melira. "So we fight now, and I heal you later."</p>

<p>Nahiri nodded and moved to Melira's side. Together, the two of them walked back to join the others. It was time to move along.</p>

<p>Jace and Kaya were preparing to depart, standing on a little hand-pumped cart that would carry them into the tunnel system that connected to the Dross Pits. Both looked grimly determined to face what lay ahead, faces set, no sign of nerves.</p>

<p>Nahiri envied them a bit of that confidence. Her own was flagging.</p>

<p>Then Jace nodded, and the cart operators began to pump. They moved away, down into the dark.</p>

<p>The others stepped onto carts of their own. Tyvar with Kaito, Nahiri with Melira and a group of Mirrans. Koth and his demolitions team filled a cart by themselves, until only Elspeth remained to go into the dark. She paused, looking at the encampment around her. It was so transitory, so temporary, and yet enduring. This was what remained of the resistance. This was where Mirrodin took back its destiny, and rose again, damaged but free, or was added to the books of the dead forever.</p>

<p>They had to win. They <em>had</em> to. Not just for the Multiverse, for the Mirrans who died to get them this far, and for the Mirrans yet to come, who deserved so much better than this broken plane.</p>

<p>More determined than ever, Elspeth stepped onto the final cart, nodded to the elves operating the pump, and made her own descent into the shadows of New Phyrexia.</p>

The information they had going in was too scant in some places, and no one still living had ever witnessed a fully compleated plane. They had their intel and their recon and everything they could have to prepare them for the incursion, but he still didn't know what he'd been expecting—only, roughly, what he hadn't been.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align:right;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/HWhdVee3E9.jpg" />

</p></div></div>

<p>He certainly hadn't been expecting a feeling like slamming into a wall of electrostatic wind—not enough to do actual damage, but enough to disorient, to distract, and inevitably, to steal consciousness away.</p>

<p>And now that it had happened, he certainly hadn't been expecting New Phyrexia to look like one of the nicer tourist beaches of Kamigawa. What he could see of New Phyrexia was all pristine sand without a sign that anything more dangerous than sunbathing had ever happened here. It was pleasant. So pleasant. New Phyrexia wasn't a peril, it was a paradise, and he should just relax and let it wash over him like a wave from the welcoming sea<nbsp> . . .</nbsp></p>

<p>The crashing of that sea rang in his ears as he closed his eyes and sank deeper into the sand. Part of him knew Phyrexia would recognize his presence soon and react the way any dangerous beast reacted to an intruder. A small speck of unaddled coherence at the edge of his consciousness screamed at him to wake up, wake up, <em>snap out of it</em>!</p>

<p>Phyrexia was a danger. He wouldn't <em>be</em> here if Phyrexia wasn't a danger. Kamigawa was under threat, and he had to do whatever was within his power to protect everything he'd ever cared about. His friends, his plane, his sister<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> he came here to save them all.</p>

<p>But the sand was warm and inviting, and he couldn't find it in himself to move until small, strong hands grabbed him by the shoulders and jerked him into a sitting position. They felt familiar, like hands that he should know. They also felt like an attack, and so he thrashed, trying to pull away. The small, screaming corner of his mind screamed even louder, trying to remind him that fighting back should have been his <em>first</em> thought, his <em>first</em> reaction to even a whisper of hostile action, but no: only futile thrashing seemed to suit.</p>

<p>One of those small, strong hands released his shoulder, and he was able to pull briefly free, ready to sink back into peace and pleasure, before it slammed into his cheek, striking him just below the eye so hard that he heard the crack as much as he felt it. He recoiled, eyes jerking open, and for the first time, he realized that what he'd taken for the sound of waves was actually the sound of metal clashing on metal, spells impacting their targets, and grunts of exertion. Someone screamed, and he knew, without question, that before the blow he would have heard it as some kind of seabird flying overhead—if he'd been able to hear it at all.</p>

<p>"There," said the Wanderer with some satisfaction, releasing his other shoulder and shaking the impact out of her hand, knuckles reddened but otherwise unscathed. "I was wondering when you were going to join us."</p>

<p>"Join—?" Kaito paused, thoughts flickering back to the wall of static wind. The wall he had remembered as pleasant, even peaceful, only a moment before. But it hadn't been, had it? It had been<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> it had been<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> it had been something he couldn't remember, except for the sound of screams. Some of them might even have been his own.</p>

<p>He grabbed instinctively for his sword, body suddenly flooded with the adrenaline that should have been there all along, and froze as he realized his equipment was gone. No sword: no small, friendly spirit emulating a tanuki drone in form and function. Phyrexia had slapped him down when he should have been untouchable and stripped him bare in the same instant. His eyes flicked back to the Wanderer, just in time to catch her momentarily disappearing, guttering out like a dying candle.</p>

<p>"No," he said, shaking his head fiercely. "No. You need more time. <em>I</em> need more time. You can't go before you tell me what I missed."</p>

<p>"A—barrier," she said. "We didn't expect it, and it seems to have—blocked my ability to anchor myself. Can't—stay here. Losing grasp. Have to—tell you—" A look of profound frustration crossed her face, and she turned, shouting at a point slightly beyond Kaito's right shoulder, "Nahiri! Stop—toying with that—thing!"</p>

<p>Kaito turned, loath as he was to take his eyes off the Wanderer when she was so close to vanishing, and beheld Nahiri, sword in hand and cheeks faintly flushed with exertion, the heat of her blood showing through the slatey tone of her skin. She was dancing—no, <em>fighting</em> with a figure that looked to have been shaped from liquid metal spliced with panels of wiry cabling, like a fever dream of mechanical poetry escaped from the inventor's bench and turned against the world. It seemed impossible that anyone, even the lithomancer, could fight this construction and win.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align:right;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/oqtwePVjhp.jpg" />

</p></div></div>

<p>Then the air flashed around her, igniting with a crash as loud as thunder, as Nahiri called the glittering metallic sand of New Phyrexia to join her dance. It rose grain by grain to swirl around her, a storm even deadlier than her hail of shaped stone blades, and crashed together on the fighting figure, overwhelming it as sand invaded exposed machinery and nasal passages alike, putting down Nahiri's opponent in the blink of an eye.</p>

<p>As it fell, Nahiri was there, stepping forward and driving her primary blade home, through the center of the creature. She twisted once, and the shape beneath the mounded sand was still.</p>

<p>"<em>Nahiri</em>," snapped the Wanderer, voice strong enough that for a moment Kaito dared to hope she was stabilizing. He turned back to her, and his heart sank. She was still fading in and out, close to being pulled back into the Blind Eternities. It must have been taking immense power of will to stay even this long.</p>

<p>Nahiri trotted across the metal sands as easily as if she were walking on solid ground, pausing to bob her head to Kaito before focusing on the Wanderer. "You called?"</p>

<p>The Wanderer frowned. "Scrambled longer—than—need to explain—what he—missed," she said, words spaced oddly as she flickered too far out of phase to be heard.</p>

<p>"Right," said Nahiri. She focused on Kaito. "I don't know whether they knew we were coming or whether they're just paranoid monsters, but we slammed into some sort of planar shield when we breached New Phyrexia. We should have been fine. We pretty obviously weren't. I don't know where most of our team wound up. The three of us crashed down here. Sand got you?"</p>

<p>Numbly, Kaito nodded.</p>

<p>"Got me at first, too," said Nahiri. "Luckily for me, this whole place is made of metal—not the normal kind, but close enough for my purposes, even if this stuff would rather harm us than help us. It's a passive weapon. It'll still kill you if you let it. I shook myself out of it, found the Wanderer standing over you, shifting in and out of the plane. Not sure she'll be hanging on much longer."</p>

<p>"What was that <em>thing</em> you were fighting?" asked Kaito, not wanting to think about the possibility of losing the Wanderer to the Blind Eternities for even a little while.</p>

<p>"One of the locals," said Nahiri, shrugging. "Fast. Pretty lethal. No real challenge."</p>

<p>"You're not hurt?"</p>

<p>"Just a scratch. Nothing I can't walk off." She reached up and touched the back of her neck with her free hand, fingers coming away damp with blood—not smeared, as they would have been had she been direly injured. "My blood's still red. No oil. I'll be fine."</p>

<p>She held up her bloody fingers for his inspection, smiling faintly. Behind him, the Wanderer's eyes widened, and she flickered faster, apparently gathering her strength for another exclamation.</p>

<p>Nahiri lowered her hand. "Come on," she said. "I don't know where we are, but we need to meet the others on the Furnace Layer, and we don't want to hang around anywhere Phyrexia wants us to be. Let's get moving before this place comes up with defenses beyond a few foot soldiers and some hypnotic sand."</p>

<p>"I lost my equipment," said Kaito.</p>

<p>"Is it in the sand?"</p>

<p>He shook his head as he looked around.</p>

<p>"I don't <em>think</em> so," he said. "If my drone were here, she'd be digging her way back to me. You're the metal detector, not me. Do you feel any Kamigawa steel near us?"</p>

<p>"Sorry. Just Phyrexian metals," said Nahiri.</p>

<p>"We'll find it," Kaito said. "And we'll find the others. Do you know which way to go?"</p>

<p>"This way," said Nahiri, and started walking. "If we stayed on our original trajectory as we fell, the next landing zone is in this direction. If we didn't, then we're just lost in Phyrexia, and you should start praying to whatever you believe in."</p>

<p>"How did you orient yourself so quickly?" asked Kaito, trying to slow her down enough for him to help the Wanderer across the sand. Not that she would normally have needed any assistance, but with as uncertain as her grip on this plane was, he wanted to do anything he could to make this easier on her.</p>

<p>"I've had practice," Nahiri replied. "I saw explosions coming from over that way. Things got chaotic over there." She had a grim satisfaction in her tone. It was hard to tell whether she was proud of their companions for wrecking things, envious that she hadn't been given the same opportunity, or pleased that she'd been able to finish her own fight without any major difficulties. Nahiri could be confusing that way. He didn't know her well enough to tease her meaning out of everything she said yet, and wasn't sure, under the circumstances, that he was going to get the chance.</p>

<p>They trudged across the sand—sand that wasn't anything of the sort when Kaito looked at it more closely; what he'd been taking for a seashore was an infinite desert of particulate metal, pieces of Mirrodin ground into fine dust by Phyrexian power. The Wanderer paced beside him, flicking and silent, clearly spending all her energy on remaining in tune with the plane. He glanced once again to Nahiri.</p>

<p>"Nothing here is what it looks like," she said, voice brusque. "You can't trust anything Phyrexian. It's all lying to you, all the time, whether it knows it or not. Keep moving."</p>

<p>Kaito kept moving.</p>

<p>The desert stretched out ahead of them, extending to the distant base of a massive, incomprehensible monument built according to some twisted parody of geometry. They pressed on into the shadow of the titanic monument, a tiny trio of attackers moving through a hostile land, and nothing else moved, and they were alone, and the oppressive weight of Phyrexia was all around them, and they were never going to be alone again.</p>

<p>The landscape grew more and more ordered as they pressed on, terrible in its alien symmetries. Vast constructs of gleaming metal cast their shadows across the shining ground, celebrating unthinkable victories, glistening in spots with exposed flesh that made Kaito's skin crawl. Were they leftover structures from Mirrodin, or the sleeping forms of Phyrexian goliaths?</p>

<p>Some mysteries were better left unsolved. At least Mirrodin's five suns still shone, dim through the dense fog. The group rounded the terminus of a low wall that seemed to have been forged from half-melted bone mixed with silver and stopped at the sight of a stone statue hanging suspended between two iron pillars in a tangle of steel-sheened cables.</p>

<p>It depicted an elf, short and muscular, and so perfectly carved that Kaito could have sworn he saw it breathe. It looked entirely out of place in the Phyrexian tangle of metal and bone.</p>

<p>Nahiri hissed sharply. Kaito glanced at her, confused.</p>

<p>"That stone," she said. "That's a Zendikari hedron. Either Phyrexia has reached Zendikar, or something else is going on here."</p>

<p>The Wanderer pointed to the figure. Kaito followed her finger. Why would a statue be wearing <em>clothes</em>? More, why would a statue be <em>armed</em>? A bronze bracer holding a double-bladed sword was strapped to its left arm.</p>

<p>"He's one of ours," said Nahiri abruptly. She started to move forward.</p>

<p>Against his own better judgement, Kaito put a hand on her arm. She stopped.</p>

<p>"On Kamigawa, this would be a trap," he said.</p>

<p>She nodded slow understanding. "If it is, we take the bait," she said.</p>

<p>Kaito started looking for things he could use as projectiles. Nahiri's metal knives would have been ideal, but he wasn't sure he could wrest a single ingot away from the ancient lithomancer even if he had wanted to.</p>

<p>The debris under the statue would have to do. Kaito reached out telekinetically, pulling a cloud of metal slivers and shrapnel into the air around him. It was nothing compared to his blade or Himoto, his tanuki, but it was infinitely better than going into a fight unarmed.</p>

<p>Not that they knew this was going to be a fight. The statue might be nothing, and so far, they hadn't been attacked. Carefully, the trio moved toward the statue.</p>

<p>They were almost there when the cables holding it up writhed into sudden activity, like a nest of snakes waking from hibernation. Some of them unsnarled themselves completely and reared, increasing the impression of serpentine awareness. Kaito tensed, preparing to strike with his array of makeshift arrows. The Wanderer raised a hand, motioning him into stillness. He stopped, still tense but not yet striking, to watch Nahiri move forward with cautious grace.</p>

<p>The cables twisted to track her motion. The statue opened its eyes and started to struggle as the cables drew tighter.</p>

<p>"Definitely one of ours," said Nahiri. "He looks uninjured. We should be able to cut him free."</p>

<p>"So we attack?" Kaito looked to the Wanderer.</p>

<p>She nodded assent, and he unleashed the confused fury he'd been carrying since the beach in a hail of shrapnel, raining crude razors down on the nest of cables in a twisting swarm of pirouetting, swirling slashes. The cables responded, lashing out at the cloud, the clash forming a discordant symphony of cracking, exploding metals.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Nahiri spun into action, her own blaze of knives darting forward to continue what Kaito's makeshift armory had begun, slicing and cutting away at the cable creature with an artist's precision. The statue dipped lower and lower as the taut metallic sinews holding him were cut away, until, with a loud snapping sound, the last one broke and dumped him to the ground. The Wanderer rushed forward and knelt beside him, feeling for a pulse.</p>

<p>The stone man responded by swinging a mighty, if disoriented, haymaker at her. His fist passed through the white-haired woman's body like she was a ghost, leaving her frowning disapprovingly.</p>

<p>"She's not quite here," said Kaito, following the Wanderer's footsteps to offer the stone man his hands. "Please don't hit her again."</p>

<p>"What—" The former statue let himself be pulled to his feet and looked frantically around, finally focusing on Nahiri, who was applying a bandage from Kaito's med pack to the back of her neck, pressing the magically adhesive edges firmly down. "What <em>happened</em>?"</p>

<p>The Wanderer, who had been silent since calling Nahiri from her fight, swallowed and clearly gathered her strength. "Hit a—barrier," she managed, voice flickering in volume like she was fluxing rapidly near to far. "Everyone—split apart. Trying—find others."</p>

<p>Nahiri looked over at them. "Are we going to have to do this every time we find someone?" she asked. "Because it's going to get real old if we do."</p>

<p>The statue laughed, looking heartened by her sniping. "We may be lost in a hostile plane, but some things remain the same; heroes clash when first they meet." The stone drained from his skin, replaced by a light tan. He offered the Wanderer a polite bow. "I am Tyvar Kell, Prince of Kaldheim. I thank you for your counsel."</p>

<p>She opened her mouth, but no sound came out. A look of frustration crossed her face.</p>

<p>"The Wanderer isn't stabilizing," said Kaito. "I don't know how she's managed to hold on for this long, but if we don't rest, we're going to lose her soon."</p>

<p>"She'll be back," said Nahiri.</p>

<p>"But will it matter if we don't wait for her?"</p>

<p>Nahiri didn't have an answer for that. She looked from Kaito to the Wanderer and repeated, "We have to keep moving."</p>

<p>As a group, the four of them resumed their trek through the blasted wastes of New Phyrexia. There was beauty in the grim monuments that stood in the distance, but having seen the living cables holding Tyvar, Kaito was all too aware that everything they passed was a construction of this bitter plane, and not grown or nurtured by the plane's own nature. Anything could become a threat at any moment.</p>

<p>The Wanderer continued to flicker and did not speak again. She stayed close to Kaito, looking around them with evident worry. Something was clearly bothering her—he wished he had some way to help her, but they couldn't afford to stop long enough for him to try.</p>

</p></div></div>

<p>On they went, until on the horizon a small, ramshackle assemblage of tents and lean-tos appeared, small figures visible moving between them. Nahiri and Tyvar tensed. Kaito, more concerned about getting the Wanderer to a place of rest, motioned for them to be calm. The group continued moving until the figures came into clearer view: they were Mirrans. Most were human, with bronze skin and gold armor, flashes of white fabric visible between the plates. Leonin also moved among them, comforting feline figures. Soft gold glinted from what little exposed skin could be seen around their armor.</p>

<p>All of them moved with the natural grace of the organic, rather than the strange gait of the compleated, and Kaito exhaled. Safety. Such as it could be found on this plane, it was there, ahead of them.</p>

<p>He turned to the Wanderer, intending to say something to boost her spirits and bolster her strength. His exhale became a sigh as he saw that she was gone. She had been able to hold on long enough to see her childhood friend out of the initial danger, and no longer than that.</p>

<p>"She'll be back," said Kaito, as much to himself as to the others. "She always comes back."</p>

<p>"Take heart, friend," said Tyvar, clapping him on the shoulder. "We have far yet to go."</p>

<p>"Yes, but<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> I wanted us to make it here together," said Kaito, and he started walking again. Together, the three of them approached the camp.</p>

<p>A wiry human woman with short-cropped red hair and fair skin devoid of metal ornamentation came out to meet them, a staff topped with a gleaming light held low by her side, posing no immediate threat, but ready to become one.</p>

</p></div></div>

<p>"You aren't Phyrexian," she said, voice sharp. "You're the ones Koth told us were coming. I'm Melira. I'm a friend, and a healer. Are any of you hurt? Do you require aid?"</p>

<p>"No," said Tyvar, voice bright in the cool, still air. "We came following Karn and the Gatewatch's call, but we were lost on arrival, and you're the first friendly faces we've seen. Are there others like us here?"</p>

<p>"Ah," said the woman, understanding. "I'd heard rumors Elesh Norn was setting up some sort of defense barrier against people like you. Guess she got it up and running. The rest of your people should be gathering two layers down, in the Furnace, assuming they made it that far."</p>

<p>She began moving away from the small encampment, gesturing for the three of them to follow.</p>

<p>"This is the Monumental Facade," she said. "When the Phyrexians took Mirrodin. They built a shell around our plane, trapping those of us who'd survived to keep fighting underneath. We wouldn't be allowed to see the suns from our original home any longer. This is where they send their toys to fight each other to the death, but we came up to find you. You would have had a harder journey if we hadn't been here, drawing fire and trying to make sure nothing got away to report our location."</p>

<p>So, Phyrexia didn't have surveillance everywhere? Kaito nodded, taking this as some of the first good news they'd received since arriving.</p>

<p>"Mirrodin—the <em>real</em> Mirrodin—is beneath us," Melira continued. She stopped at the center of an oddly flat patch of ground, looking at each of them in turn before finally focusing on Nahiri. "You're the lithomancer they said was coming, yeah?"</p>

<p>"I am," said Nahiri, knives shifting in the air around her. "Why?"</p>

<p>"It'll help, that's all," said Melira, and she slammed the butt of her staff down on the center of the clear patch.</p>

<p>There was a momentary pause, long enough for Melira to look annoyed and glance over her shoulder like she was waiting for something, and then the ground dropped out from under their feet as a roughly ten-foot square of what Melira called the Monumental Facade crumpled inward.</p>

<p>The explosive charges had been excellently set. Kaito had to admire them, even as he realized he was falling. This was a new and unsettling development. Above them, the thin shell of the plane looked like a shattered plate of black metal. Beneath them, the landscape rushed up to make their acquaintance, no more than a hundred feet below.</p>

<p>Nahiri scowled at a smiling Melira, who didn't look the least bit concerned, and the chunks of falling earth beneath them glowed dully hot as the lithomancer caught hold of them and slowed their descent, creating a shallow shell they could ride the rest of the way to the ground without being injured.</p>

<p>Melira actually laughed at that. Kaito blinked. "Why are you laughing? We could have all been killed!"</p>

<p>"Koth said you were powerful mages come to save the plane," said Melira. "Well, the Facade's shell breaks all the time, with or without our help. If you couldn't handle a little fall, you weren't going to succeed anyway. Though this is better than I would have hoped. Once we touch down, we'll be near Lowlight—we can make for the lacuna and head into the Furnace Layer to meet the rest of the survivors."</p>

<p>Kaito didn't like that word. "Survivors" felt like a premonition, and with the Wanderer already gone, it wasn't something he wanted to think about. Still, he schooled his expression to neutrality. "We're very grateful for your help," he said, and glanced to Nahiri, waiting for her to say that she'd been injured when she and the Wanderer had found him in the sand. She did nothing of the sort, keeping all her focus on guiding them to a landing.</p>

<p>It had only been a scratch, after all. Better not to break her concentration for a scratch when it was nothing that required healing.</p>

<p>Tyvar had other questions. He waved a hand, indicating the land around them. "We descend farther? Is this not the Furnace Layer?"</p>

<p>"No," said Melira. "The Phyrexians call this Mirrex. They can't even allow us the grace of our true name. I told you the real Mirrodin was beneath us. This is all that remains of our home."</p>

<p>"I see," said Tyvar, subdued.</p>

<p>"The main force of our assault teams will be gathered in Lowlight, ready to aid you in your efforts," said Melira. "There's no price too great for us to pay for a free Mirrodin. This was a beautiful land once. Fate allowing, it will be again."</p>

<p>"For Mirrodin, and the Multiverse," Kaito said, and Melira smiled at him in brief unity before moving to look over the edge of Nahiri's makeshift platform.</p>

<p>Mirrodin—what remained of it—was a wasteland beneath them, withered from lack of light, without even the alien beauty of the surface. If Phyrexia had done this to break the spirit of the resistance, they had probably come closer than anyone wanted to believe.</p>

<p>Nahiri guided their makeshift conveyance to a stop on the surface, looking to Melira. "Is the whole place like this?" she asked.</p>

<p>Melira nodded. "It is. You keep going down, and there's always some new horrible surprise waiting for you." She hopped off the piece of shell to the ground, which was actual stone here, interspersed with more of those metallic hexes. "At least they're predictable about it. Everything wants to kill or compleat you. No exceptions."</p>

<p>"Not even you?" asked Nahiri.</p>

<p>"Me?" said Melira. "I'm immune. It's why the Resistance lets me move around without a guard, and why Koth had me watching for you. Come on. Lowlight's this way."</p>

<p>She began moving briskly across the wasteland, leaving the Planeswalkers to follow her toward the low, battered shape of a Mirran camp. Once they reached the border, she led them straight through to a low wall of what looked like razored glass, gesturing to it broadly.</p>

<p>"We took the lacuna when Koth said you were coming," she said. "It'll take us down to the Furnace Layer. We would have released it soon, assuming no one was coming."</p>

<p>"Then we go down," said Nahiri.</p>

<p>Melira looked halfway amused. "Have any of you used one of these before?"</p>

<p>"No," said Kaito.</p>

<p>"They're fun," she said. "They play games with gravity internally, so you don't fall beyond that first jump. Starting off is always harder than continuing." Melira strode toward the lacuna, easily stepping up the series of crates that had been stacked next to the wall, and leapt off.</p>

<p>The Planeswalkers followed her. Upon climbing the same crates and looking down, they saw her standing on the floor of a tunnel of some sort, dropping into the depths of Phyrexia, lit from within by a pale, sourceless illumination. She looked back over her shoulder at them.</p>

<p>"Well?" she asked. "Are you doing this?"</p>

<p>Nahiri leapt without hesitation, and Kaito jumped after her. There was a moment of sickening disorientation, and then he was standing on the wall of the tunnel. Looking back, Tyvar was the one who looked like he was positioned in defiance of gravity, something the big man clearly realized, because he laughed and jumped into the lacuna.</p>

<p>"Onward, friends," he said, and strode forward. Kaito paced him, and in short order, the pair had passed Nahiri, descending into Phyrexian soil.</p>

<p>Melira hung back slightly with Nahiri, glancing at the bandage on the back of the other woman's neck, but not asking—not yet.</p>

<hr />

<p>Nahiri didn't feel right. She was familiar with her body and the way it was meant to come together, bones and tissues laced like stones in good soil, and right now, something felt awry. The cut at the back of her neck, the small, inconsequential injury, throbbed, intruding on her awareness more than anything so minor had the right to. She hung back a little, allowing Melira to pass her, before she reached behind herself to feel the bandage she'd taken from Kaito's pack. The gauze was oddly bunched, as if something had pressed against it from below.</p>

<p>Peeling back the bandage, she touched the surface beneath with delicate fingers and found no injury, only smooth skin and a short, slick protrusion that had no business growing there, as if her bones had decided to reshape themselves. She pulled her hand away with a hiss of dismay, somehow unsurprised to see that they gleamed with the same glistening oil as had tipped the spears of the Phyrexians.</p>

<p>She was infected.</p>

<p>She was already lost.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align:right;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/kHfrtjIaPl.jpg" />
<p class="embedImageCaption">Art by: <a href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&amp;output=spoiler&amp;method=visual&amp;artist=+[%22PINDURSKI%22]" target="_blank">PINDURSKI</a>
</p></div></div>

<p>She knew she should tell her companions—but how? And what good would it do any of them to know? They couldn't kill her, and if they tried, she would fight back, regardless of her condition. She couldn't leave, or she would carry the taint away from this doomed and dying plane to infect another. The Mirran was supposedly a healer, but even a healer couldn't stop this—could they? No, it was best to get them as far as she possibly could before she succumbed and became something that was easier for them to destroy.</p>

<p>Pressing the bandage back down, she re-covered the wound, and pressed onward.</p>

<hr />

<p>The Mirran camp, small as it had been, was razed and gone when the white-haired woman in the wide-brimmed hat appeared, looking warily around, sword at the ready. Nothing moved or motioned to attack her.</p>

<p>"Kaito!" she cried. "Kaito, are you here?"</p>

<p>Nothing answered. A patch of ground had fallen inward not far away, and the Wanderer ran toward it, recognizing it for what it was. She peered down into the depths and saw no sign of her companions; only rubble on the distant Mirran ground. They were gone.</p>

<p>She had returned from the Blind Eternities too late, and they were lost.</p>

<p>"I could have warned them," she moaned. "They have no idea what they're walking into. We were naive to think this could be so easily achieved."</p>

<p>She straightened. Her time on this plane would be brief. If she was going to see them again, she would. Until that happened, all she could do was wait for her departure and hope for their safety.</p>

<p>It wouldn't be enough. It had to be enough.</p>

<p>It was all she had.</p>

All will be one! Welcome to a plane ruled by the oldest and most terrifying creatures in the Multiverse as we prepare to spread our viral gift to every plane.</p>

<h2>What Is Phyrexia?</h2>

<p>Phyrexia is a society of biomechanical creatures who want to achieve an artificial, inorganic vision of "perfection." Our parasitic civilization invades and consumes all planes it encounters, expanding its ranks by converting other beings into biomechanical creatures. Our infection ("phyresis") is a divine gift. Those who oppose us are misguided or evil and must be shown the error of their ways.</p>

<h2>Phyresis</h2>

<p>Phyrexians reproduce using flesh-vats and birthing pods, or they are created by infecting other beings with glistening oil. The oil is a mutagen that first twists the minds of the infected and can induce memory loss and personality changes. The oil eventually replaces all vital liquids in the host body, which prepares it for compleation, a surgical process that swaps the body's organic matter with artificial machinery. The oil can corrupt artifacts as well as organic beings.</p>

<p>The compleation surgeries are overseen by other Phyrexians. When these procedures prove fatal, necromancy becomes involved. When the host's body is fully integrated with machinery, they are considered truly Phyrexianized. Degrees of alteration and retained intelligence vary drastically. Higher-ranked Phyrexians are usually granted heavier alterations and greater intelligence.</p>

<p>Reversing phyresis is difficult. After infection passes a certain stage, rehabilitation becomes impossible. Recovery varies per individual and becomes more difficult with increased compleation. Healing the mind may require different processes than healing body. However, several substances, like Halo, can stave off the transformative effects of glistening oil, and some individuals, like Melira, are entirely immune.</p>

</div>

<h2>Yawgmoth and Old Phyrexia</h2>

<p>The Phyrexians originated on an artificial plane, now referred to as "Old Phyrexia," created by an unknown Planeswalker. Yawgmoth, a medical genius from Dominaria, planeswalked to Old Phyrexia and installed himself as the plane's new ruler, the Father of Machines. He used the Phyrexians to launch repeated invasions of his home plane until he was finally slain by the golem Karn and his allies. Old Phyrexia was destroyed, but Karn became an unwitting carrier of its oil.</p>

</figure>
</div>

<h2>Mirrodin</h2>

<p>Karn created Mirrodin, an independent, metallic plane with five colored suns and multiple unique cultures. But he accidentally left a drop of glistening oil upon the plane's inner core. The oil slowly corrupted the landscape and wildlife from the inside out. Many Mirrans turned into Phyrexians, including legendary heroes. The divided Mirran cultures succumbed to Phyrexia when it reached the outer layer.</p>

<h2>New Phyrexia</h2>

<p>Under the influence of Mirrodin's five colored suns, the Phyrexians manifested into five factions, each led by a different praetor. Each harvested mycosynth to reshape Mirrodin to fit their vision of perfection, making an internal sphere of their own. Finally, they enclosed the plane's original surface with a new sphere and decorated it with massive, unsettling monuments honoring their victory.</p>

<h2>A New Invasion</h2>

<p>Having conquered Mirrodin and established New Phyrexia, they set their sights on the other planes in the Multiverse. Elesh Norn, leader of the Machine Orthodoxy, promised the Planeswalker Tezzeret an indestructible darksteel body in exchange for his services. Using the Planar Bridge, he transported the inorganic parts of the other praetors to different planes where they would be reassembled to carry out tasks that Norn gave them.</p>

<p>First, Vorinclex went to Kaldheim and stole essence from the World Tree. Jin-Gitaxias then appeared in Kamigawa and invented a method to Phyrexianize Planeswalkers. Urabrask evaded his orders and visited New Capenna to further his own agenda. Finally, Sheoldred arrived on Dominaria, a plane that defeated Phyrexia before, to eliminate anything that might get in the way.</p>

<p>One of the items she destroyed was a device of mass destruction called the sylex. At great cost, a group of Planeswalkers built a new sylex and created a strike team to carry the weapon into the heart of New Phyrexia.</p>

</div>

<h2>The Nine Spheres</h2>

<p>New Phyrexia is an active, mutating, biomechanical plane. With little distinction between living, dead, and mechanical organisms, the environment itself is prone to changing on its own.</p>

</figure>
</div>

<h3>The Monumental Facade</h3>

<p>After conquering Mirrodin, the praetors decided to display their unified power by enclosing the entire plane within a single outer sphere and decorating it with commemorative monuments. These ominous structures exist beyond human comprehension and have no obvious pattern. Occasionally, towers crumble without warning, only for another to mysteriously arise elsewhere.</p>

<div class="figure-wrapper">

</figure>
</div>

<h3>Mirrex</h3>

<p>Mirrex was originally the outer of Mirrodin's two original spheres, but the Phyrexian invasion left it an apocalyptic ruin. Mirrodin's various landmarks were dismantled and their parts taken under the surface to make New Phyrexia's inner spheres. Cut off from their suns' mana, the Mirran survivors continue to scrape by while evading constant forays of Phyrexian scavengers on the lookout for more material.</p>

<div class="figure-wrapper">

</figure>
</div>

<h3>The Autonomous Furnace</h3>

<p>The Autonomous Furnace, where the Quiet Furnace lives, was the first layer the Phyrexians established, prior to their first assault on Mirrodin. It played a crucial role in the initial invasion. Metal parts crafted here were used to compleat Mirrans into Phyrexian troops. Although the entire sphere functions as a single forge, it is divided into smaller, independent sections overseen by furnace bosses. Praetor Urabrask's detached leadership means they often do whatever they want and clash with each other.</p>

</figure>
</div>

<h3>The Hunter Maze</h3>

<p>The Hunter Maze, where the Vicious Swarm dwells, was assembled from the remains of the Mirran Tangle. After being compleated, Glissa, the former elven hero, worked with the praetor Vorinclex to dismantle it and make a "survival of the fittest" battlefield. Giant, deadly beasts prey on each other in its endless, canopied forest. Most praetors rule with an iron fist, but Vorinclex and Glissa prefer to sit back and admire the beautiful evolution they created.</p>

</figure>
</div>

<h3>The Surgical Bay</h3>

<p>The Surgical Bay is home to the Progress Engine. Known simply as the Fourth Layer during the initial invasion, this liquid sphere was created to spread glistening oil under Mirrodin's surface. Once the Mirrans had been compleated, Praetor Jin-Gitaxias drained Mirrodin's Quicksilver Sea into the Fourth Layer to create an even larger oil reservoir. Mirran research centers were transported down and renovated for Phyrexian experimentation. The Fathom Ward, an underwater sea monster facility, holds the final known vials of blinkmoth serum that filled Mirrodin's Knowledge Pool.</p>

<div class="figure-wrapper">

</figure>
</div>

<h3>The Dross Pits</h3>

<p>The Dross Pits are a land of eternal conflict led by the Seven Steel Thanes. Thane Roxith began the project, naming his sphere the Flesh Layer, but Thane Sheoldred tricked him and claimed it for herself. Since then, the other remaining thanes have moved in, established their own strongholds, and restarted their war games. They regularly send armed battalions against each other, but no one has deposed Sheoldred yet.</p>

</figure>
</div>

<h3>The Fair Basilica</h3>

<p>After declaring herself the dominant praetor of all Phyrexia, Elesh Norn claimed the prime location for the Machine Orthodoxy. Her realm surrounds Mirrodin's mycosynth growths. Controlling a crucial material for building new spheres ensured Norn retained power over the other praetors. Every aspect of the Fair Basilica was designed as a symbolic testament to Norn, helping her consolidate her rule over all Phyrexians.</p>

</figure>
</div>

<h3>The Mycosynth Gardens</h3>

<p>This Mycosynth Gardens were the original inner core of Mirrodin. In contrast to the other spheres, which are packed with bustling Phyrexian unlife, the Mycosynth Gardens are mysteriously still and empty. No one may enter this sphere without permission from Elesh Norn.</p>

<div class="figure-wrapper">

</figure>
</div>

<h3>The Seedcore</h3>

<p>The Seedcore grows from the most historically significant site of Mirrodin. The plane's first ruler, Memnarch, lived among the mycosynth towers in an observation deck he called the Panopticon. It was later renamed the Throne Room and converted into a prison for Karn. Norn planted essence from Kaldheim's World Tree in Karn's empty seat. Her new tree's branches will touch other planes and open them up for invasion.</p>

<h2>The Phyrexian Factions</h2>

<p>All factions want to dominate the Multiverse and spread the glory of Phyrexia, but each has its own vision, methods, and terms for perfection.</p>

<div class="figure-wrapper">

</figure>
</div>

<h3>The Machine Orthodoxy</h3>

<p>The Machine Orthodoxy sees phyresis as a blessing that will unify all living creatures and end needless conflict. They believe a rigid, structured hierarchy is necessary to maintain order, so they sought a leader who can replicate the glory days of Yawgmoth. This search was headed by Praetor Elesh Norn. However, her previous figurehead, Karn, escaped, revealing the true mastermind was Norn herself. Now, Norn has embraced her role as the self-styled "Mother of Machines" and is developing a plan that will surpass her forebears: unite all Phyrexian factions to raise an army that will indoctrinate the Multiverse.</p>

</figure>
</div>

<h4>Elesh Norn, Mother of Machines</h4>

<p>Elesh Norn leads the Machine Orthodoxy. She is an arrogant master manipulator who devoutly believes in her own rhetoric and does not like to be questioned. She is a fascist, theocratic dictator who designs monuments in her own image. Although she works with the other praetors, she wants to be the one leading the charge. Elesh Norn designed grand plans for all of Phyrexia and wrote the <em>Argent Etchings</em>, scriptures for her followers.</p>

</figure>
</div>

<h3>The Progress Engine</h3>

<p>The Progress Engine grew unconcerned with New Phyrexia as a societal whole. Total compleation is the only true end goal, and they believe systemic experimentation will lead to more efficient phyresis methods. Jin-Gitaxias and the Progress Engine turned the conquered vedalkens into a living research library and co-opted many of their principles and materials, including their academic structure. Studying the vedalkens' blinkmoth serum also allowed the Progress Engine to enhance their vast reserve of glistening oil, making it more virulent and able to proliferate through organic material at record speeds.</p>

</figure>
</div>

<h4>Jin-Gitaxias, Core Augur</h4>

<p>The Progress Engine is run by Jin-Gitaxias. He is cold, brutal, and believes he is the smartest of the praetors. His hypotheses are calculated and meticulous, and often successful. However, he sees ethics as restriction on genius, so his research is often painful and traumatizing for his subjects, often even lethal. Jin-Gitaxias thinks he has created the most accurate interpretation of the Phyrexian scriptures, which he calls <em>The Great Synthesis</em>.</p>

</figure>
</div>

<h3>The Seven Steel Thanes</h3>

<p>The Seven Steel Thanes rose from the swamp and saw themselves as direct heirs to Yawgmoth's Old Phyrexia. They will only follow his original Phyrexian scriptures and view the other factions as threats, especially the Machine Orthodoxy with its figurehead leadership. Together, the thanes are a loose, feudal faction headed by Sheoldred. Each other thane is biding their time until they can seize power. However, they all agree the best compleation methods or Phyrexian social structure is simply whichever one works.</p>

</figure>
</div>

<h4>Sheoldred, The Whispering One</h4>

<p>Sheoldred is the tenuous leader of the Seven Steel Thanes. She is graceful, cruel, and the cleverest of the thanes. Her tactics are primarily covert and underhanded, frequently leveraging lies or misinformation. She earned her praetor position by manipulating the other thanes against each other. She hides her knowledge in irregular, whispering puzzle boxes known as astral coffers.</p>

<h3>The Quiet Furnace</h3>

<p>Mirrodin's red sun had an unforeseen effect on the Phyrexians. It gave them a sense of individualism, even sparking empathy in those of higher intelligence. Most suppressed this internal conflict by distracting themselves with the Great Work, reforging metal and incinerating failing organisms. However, Praetor Urabrask reflected and concluded that diversity and eccentricity are strengths in the Quiet Furnace. Unlike the other praetors who force new recruits into their designs, Urabrask prefers they retain the strongest parts of their original form and contribute these assets to Phyrexia. Secretly, he prefers when beings willingly choose to join New Phyrexia, but he is not above destroying those who oppose it.</p>

</figure>
</div>

<h4>Urabrask</h4>

<p>Urabrask oversees the Quiet Furnace. He has a blazing-hot temper and is easily infuriated when dealing with others. Urabrask closed the Furnace Layer off to the rest of the factions and does not engage with them unless forced. He even declared the Mirran resistance to be left alone so he and his subjects could focus on the Great Work. This drew suspicion from the other factions, but most see him as glorified factory manager and did not pursue action. However, Urabrask sees Elesh Norn's uniform hegemony as a threat to his individualistic vision of Phyrexia and is preparing to rebel against her. He even upgraded his own body in preparation for his attack on her palace.</p>

</figure>
</div>

<h3>The Vicious Swarm</h3>

<p>The Vicious Swarm interpreted the idea of the Phyrexian's Grand Evolution through a biological lens and developed a "survival of the fittest" ideology. Praetor Vorinclex and his steward, Glissa, believed they could hasten natural selection by creating a gladiatorial environment where predators hunt each other. The weakest were eaten, and the strongest grew larger and larger. The monstrous Vorinclex often entertains himself by partaking in these brawls, leaving Glissa to handle long-term matters and other factions.</p>

<h4>Vorinclex</h4>

<p>Vorinclex rules the Vicious Swarm as its apex predator. Although he is relatively intelligent, he prefers making decisions with primal instinct and solves issues with brute strength and sharp fangs. So far, he has successfully maintained his dominance in the Grand Evolution by defeating any challengers and feeding on their bodies to strengthen himself. Vorinclex delegates most of his responsibilities to the compleated elf Glissa. She was an indispensable help when designing the Hunter Maze. Now, Glissa controls much of the fighting force of the Vicious Swarm and often speaks as Vorinclex's voice when dealing with other praetors.</p>

<h2>Unaligned Phyrexians</h2>

<p>As Phyrexia has grown, some creatures developed under the influence of multiple factions or outside of the factions entirely.</p>

<h3>The Domini</h3>

<p>As the Phyrexians compleated the terrain of Mirrodin, the lines between life, death, and inanimate object blurred. Parts of the plane itself grew sentient and became huge, mobile creatures. Now, these mysterious cosmic beings roam throughout the spheres, driven by individual motivations and personalities. The Domini often possess qualities similar to the faction that compleated them, but they usually consider themselves above politics or allegiances. However, they are known to work with praetors who suit their ends.</p>

<h3>Mirrans</h3>

<p>The Mirrans were the inhabitants of Mirrodin prior to the Phyrexians' arrival. Under Mirrodin's five colored suns, they developed into five distinct cultures occupying their own biospheres on the plane's surface. When the Phyrexians launched their initial assault, the Mirrans could not put aside their cultural differences, which made them easy to divide and conquer. The Morioks fell first. Then the Neuroks and vedalken. Finally, the Sylvoks and elves. Only the Aurioks and Vulshoks managed to hold any of their ground, and their populations were still decimated.</p>

<p>In the time since, the survivors have learned better. Under strong leadership from the Vulshok Planeswalker Koth, the Mirrans put aside their differences and formed new, nomadic groups. Because they are constantly under threat, every individual trains to be a guerilla fighter, including children and elders. Their tactics rely on resourcefulness and teamwork. Now a united resistance, the Mirrans know they are stronger together.</p>

<h2>Hexgold</h2>

<p>Hexgold is golden metal refined from Glimmervoid plates that Mirrans use to craft weapons. When injected into the body, it grants some resistance to phyresis. The Goldwardens are elite warriors who provide security for Mirran settlements, conduct guerilla missions against the Phyrexians, and train the rest of the community. They are identified by their hexgold implants.</p>

Normally, I focus on cards that have a higher profile, such as planeswalkers and legendary creatures, which means I tend to write more about rares and mythic rares. To change things up today, I'm going to tell stories about some of the commons from <em><a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/products/phyrexia-all-will-be-one" target="_blank">Phyrexia: All Will Be One</a></em>.</p>

<p><strong>Anoint with Affliction</strong></p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img src="https://media.wizards.com/2023/one/en_02133f7bc6.png" style="width: 265px; height: 370px;" /></p>

<p>Let's begin with a very effective common kill spell. All sets need a certain number of destruction spells in black at common, usually a mix of ones that can kill anything (unconditional) and others that are situational (conditional). The default is one of the former and two of the latter, but it can chance set to set. As with any basic effect that we use all the time, we're always up to finding ways to have it interact with a mechanic and/or theme from the set to make it feel organic to the product it's in. This slot went through a lot of change, so I'll walk you through it and explain why it kept changing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Deadly Attitude (version #1)</strong><br />
B<br />
Instant<br />
Target creature gets +1/+0 and gains deathtouch until end of turn.<br />
Relentless (p/b) <em>(When you cast this from your hand, exile it. When you cast another spell, you may cast this card for its relentless cost.)</em></p>

<p>The earliest version was what we call a "sideways kill card." It's a card that can help you kill a creature that you normally couldn't. This first design is a creature combat card designed to help you boost a blocker to take out an attacker. Combat cards are usually counted as a different slot than normal creature destruction.</p>

<p>This design made use of relentless, a mechanic we were trying out in vision design. (p/b) is how we write out black Phyrexian mana. All hybrid costs are written this way with Phyrexian mana getting a lowercase p instead of another color. Note that the early version of relentless cared about you playing a spell rather than a land.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Deadly Attitude (version #2)</strong><br />
1B<br />
Sorcery<br />
Target opponent loses 2 life. You gain 2 life.<br />
Relentless 1(p/b)(p/b) <em>(If you cast this spell from your hand, exile it as it resolves. You may cast it from exile for its relentless cost if you've cast a spell with a different name that turn.)</em></p>

<p>The last effect didn't work well as a relentless card. Normally, we're careful not to have cards that can be replayed easily destroy creatures to keep them from being two-for-ones (especially at common). The next effect we tried was one that drained the opponent. Note that we tweaked relentless so that it required casting a different spell.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Intermittent Headache (version #3)</strong><br />
1B<br />
Sorcery<br />
Target opponent discards a card and loses 1 life. Relentless 1(p/b)(p/b) <em>(If you cast this spell from your hand, exile it as it resolves. You may cast it from exile for its relentless cost if you've played a land that turn.)</em></p>

<p>The drain spell wasn't impactful enough, so we decided to try it as a discard spell. This is a good example of how it can be tricky to understand what works best with new mechanics, so the technique is usually to try something and change it for the next playtest if it doesn't play well. This gets complicated by the fact that we'll often tweak the mechanic as well. Note that relentless now cares about you playing a land.</p>

<p>While relentless on its surface feels like a flashback variant, playtesting can help us understand all the ways in which it's different. The two biggest differences included everything being restricted to turns that you've played lands and the ability to use life as a payment.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Diseased Mind (version #4)</strong><br />
2B<br />
Sorcery<br />
Target opponent discards two cards. For each card they can't discard, proliferate.</p>

<p>Relentless was pulled at this point (we're in set design), so the card remained a discard spell but was then tied to a different mechanic in the set, proliferate. During vision design, proliferate was in blue, green, and red, but Set Design moved it to blue, green, and black for a combination of balance and color-pie reasons.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Fade to Black (version #5)</strong><br />
2B<br />
Sorcery<br />
Destroy target creature with power 3 or less.</p>

<p>We finally allocated a destruction spell to this slot. The card is essentially a repeat (<auto-card>Vanquish the Weak</auto-card>) but with a new name. The fact that it's just a reprint says to me that the Set Design team wasn't quite sure what to do with this slot but decided they wanted it to be creature destruction, so they put in a reprint as a placeholder.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Reave Soul (version #6)</strong><br />
1B<br />
Sorcery<br />
Destroy target creature if it has mana value 3 or less.<br />
<em>Corrupted </em>– Destroy that creature if its controller has 3 or more poison counters.</p>

<p>The Set Design team eventually decided that they wanted this to have corrupted. The low-hanging fruit was to make it a conditional kill spell that becomes an unconditional kill spell when your opponent is corrupted. Two questions remained: what is the conditional limitation, and what should it cost?</p>

<p>The team decided they wanted to be more aggressive with the mana value, dropping it from 2B to 1B. This means the base ability must be a little weaker, so they made the tweak of changing power to mana value. This hits a smaller subset of creatures, and ones that, on average, are of a lower power level. The final version only makes one change from this version in that it becomes an exile effect rather than destruction. This change came about because Play Design asked Set Design to change it, as they wanted more exile effects in Standard. This change also allowed it to be an answer to the mythic rare Domini. You want to have common answers to your bomb mythic rares.</p>

<p>Finally, here's the art description for the card:</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Setting</strong>: "Lacrosse"<br />
<strong>Color</strong>: Spell associated with black mana<br />
<strong>Location</strong>: Mirrex (see pages 66–79 of the world guide)<br />
<strong>Action</strong>: Please show the moment when a Steel Thane priest (page 144a) writes with its claws to inscribe a Phyrexian inscription (page 11, choose your favorite) into the bare back of a male humanoid aspirant (pages 146–148). The inscription is written with green necrogen acid (page 79). Avoid blood and gore.<br />
<strong>Focus</strong>: The action of inscribing<br />
<strong>Mood</strong>: Horrifying ritual<br />
<strong>Notes</strong>: Copy the Phyrexian text exactly from the world guide. Do not attempt to modify it without first consulting us.</p>

<p><strong>Basilica Shepherd</strong></p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img src="https://media.wizards.com/2023/one/en_4f99e651ee.png" style="width: 265px; height: 370px;" /></p>

<p>I'd like to start this card's design story with a trivia question.</p>

<p>Is Basilica a real word or a made-up word?</p>

<p>This Phyrexian Angel went through a lot of changes. Let's take a look.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Blessbringer (version #1)</strong><br />
3W<br />
Creature — Phyrexian Cleric<br />
3/4<br />
Tainted 2 <em>(You may choose to have this creature enter the battlefield with N -1/-1 counters.) </em><br />
When CARDNAME enters the battlefield with two -1/-1 counters on it, you gain 3 life.</p>

<p>The first version of the card used a mechanic we tried in early vision design. This is back when infect was in the set, so it used -1/-1 counters. We were exploring different ways to use -1/-1 counters, and tainted was an attempt to use them in a kicker-like way. You could choose to have the creature enter with some number of -1/-1 counters, and if you did, you would get an effect. Would you rather have a 3/4 flier or a 1/2 flier that gains you 3 life?</p>

<p>It turns out you'd rather have a 3/4 flier just about every time. We found that shrinking creatures for extra effects was not the most lucrative design space, so we got rid of tainted (before we got rid of -1/-1 counters, I believe).</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Phyrexian Angel (version #2)</strong><br />
4W<br />
Creature — Phyrexian Angel<br />
3/3<br />
Flying<br />
When CARDNAME enters the battlefield, gain 2 life for each poison counter all opponents have.</p>

<p>The next version turned into an Angel and gained flying. We then tried it as what we called a "poison scaling card," a card that gets stronger the more poison the opponent has. We tried scaling alongside corrupted and found corrupted tended to do a better job, so scaling got scaled back (although there's a little left in the set).</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Oilbringer (version #3)</strong><br />
4W<br />
Creature — Phyrexian Angel<br />
3/3<br />
Flying<br />
When CARDNAME enters the battlefield, put an oil counter on target permanent you control.</p>

<p>One thing that's common in design is that you try to connect your cards to different aspects of your set, but when one thing doesn't work, you often try a different theme. Instead of caring about poison, this version interacted with oil counters. Set Design was trying to figure out how often they wanted to have a card that interacted with oil counters without giving you a way to use them. The answer was "just a little."</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Mitebringer (version #4)</strong><br />
4W<br />
Creature — Phyrexian Angel<br />
3/3<br />
Flying<br />
When CARDNAME enters the battlefield, create a colorless 1/1 Phyrexian Mite artifact creature token with poisonous 1 and "This creature can't block."</p>

<p>Set Design decided they preferred the Angel interacting with poison, so this time they had it create a Mite token. Mite tokens had been designed in vision design to let white have a swarm poison strategy. This card would eventually get pushed from creating one Mite to creating two. This forced the mana cost from 4W to 3WW. We don't do a lot of doubled-color mana pips at common (and when we do, it tends to be on higher-mana cards like this), so this was a means to make this card core to white.</p>

<p>Here's the art description:</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Setting</strong>: "Lacrosse"<br />
<strong>Color</strong>: White creature<br />
<strong>Location</strong>: The Monumental Facade (pages 15–24)<br />
<strong>Action</strong>: A Phyrexian angel (page 119A) soars through the sky. She holds a small Phyrexian mite swaddled in red cloth. Use the designs on page 115 as inspiration to design your own mites. Maybe the angel has several sets of arms and has a mite "child" swaddled in each one. Maybe we see some of the five colored suns behind her.<br />
<strong>Focus</strong>: The angel<br />
<strong>Mood</strong>: A holy mother with her children</p>

<p><strong>Experimental Augury</strong></p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img src="https://media.wizards.com/2023/one/en_9a364f301c.png" style="width: 265px; height: 370px;" /> <img src="https://media.wizards.com/2023/one/en_21c1b1378f.png" style="width: 265px; height: 370px;" /></p>

<p>This card is referred to as "<auto-card>Anticipate</auto-card> Proliferate" in R&amp;D. Let's walk through its evolution.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Thought Experimentation (version #1)</strong><br />
4U<br />
Instant<br />
Draw two cards. Proliferate.</p>

<p>From the very beginning, this card was tied to two things, card drawing and proliferating. Often our first stab at something is the simplest version of it. Let's take <auto-card>Inspiration</auto-card> (3U) and add proliferate to it. <auto-card>Inspiration</auto-card> has room to add something to it but not quite enough to get proliferate, so the cost went up to 4U.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Laboratory Incrementor (version #2)</strong><br />
2U<br />
Creature — Phyrexian Wizard<br />
2/3<br />
At the beginning of your end step, if you cast an instant or sorcery spell this turn, proliferate.</p>

<p>This slot then moved from common to uncommon and turned into a creature. The reason for both changes was to try and create a proliferate build-around, a card you would pick early that would encourage you to draft a deck around it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Productive Research (version #3)</strong><br />
U<br />
Instant<br />
Proliferate.<br />
Relentless (1U) <em>(If you cast this spell from your hand, exile it as it resolves. Whenever you play a land, you may cast this from exile for its relentless cost.)</em></p>

<p>The design team decided they wanted to turn this uncommon slot back into a spell slot rather than a creature slot (I assume because of changes made elsewhere in the file). At that time, Erik had been trying to make relentless work. Note that he'd removed Phyrexian mana from the relentless cost. Proliferate is a nice effect to get to do twice, so it made for a good relentless design. It also allowed Erik to make a cheap relentless spell.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Contentious Plan (version #4)</strong><br />
1U<br />
Instant<br />
Proliferate. Draw a card.</p>

<p>Relentless was removed from the file, so we had to redesign the card. It was at that time the slot went back to common. Unsure of what to do with the slot, the Set Design team turned it into a simple reprint.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Augmented Core (version #5)</strong><br />
2U<br />
Instant<br />
Look at the top four cards of your library. Put one of them into your hand and the rest on the bottom of your library in any order. Proliferate. <em>(Choose any number of permanents and/or players, then give each another counter of each kind already there.)</em></p>

<p>The set needed some card filtering, so they turned the proliferate common into a filtering card. The design changed to "<auto-card>Impulse</auto-card> plus proliferate" but would end up as "<auto-card>Anticipate</auto-card> plus proliferate" to allow them to drop it down to a 1U cost.</p>

<p>Here's the art description:</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Setting</strong>: "Lacrosse"<br />
<strong>Color</strong>: Spell associated with blue mana<br />
<strong>Location</strong>: A workshop in The Surgical Bay (pages 54–65)<br />
<strong>Action</strong>: Show us a shot looking inside a Phyrexian's head as a Phyrexian scientist (page 126d) performs surgery on it.<br />
<strong>Focus</strong>: The surgery<br />
<strong>Mood</strong>: Science and horror<br />
<strong>Notes</strong>: This is not a gory surgery, mostly mechanical with machine and organic matter.</p>

<p><strong>Planar Disruption</strong></p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img src="https://media.wizards.com/2023/one/en_e2db3a4c51.png" style="width: 265px; height: 370px;" /></p>

<p>In white, we normally have a common slot for an Aura that helps answer creatures. It's usually either (in R&amp;D-speak) a <auto-card>Pacifism</auto-card> that stops attacking and blocking or an <auto-card>Arrest</auto-card> that stops attacking, blocking, and activated abilities. The default casting for a <auto-card>Pacifism</auto-card> is 1W, and the default casting for an <auto-card>Arrest</auto-card> is 2W. This has been true for over 20 years.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Cenobite's Demerit (version #1)</strong><br />
W<br />
Enchantment — Aura<br />
Enchant creature<br />
Enchanted creature can't block.<br />
<em>Corrupted</em> – As long as an opponent has 3 or more poison counters, enchanted creature can't attack.</p>

<p>Interestingly, this slot started as a <auto-card>Pacifism</auto-card> variant. The first version was made as a corrupted card where once corrupted it became a <auto-card>Pacifism</auto-card>. This allowed it to cost just a single white mana.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Cenobite's Demerit (version #2)</strong><br />
W<br />
Enchantment — Aura<br />
Enchant creature<br />
Enchanted creature can't attack or block unless its controller pays {2}.<br />
<em>Corrupted</em> – As long as an opponent has 3 or more poison counters, enchanted creature can't attack or block.</p>

<p>The first version playtested poorly, so they changed it into a version that would have more functionality in the early game. The taxing mostly means the creature is effectively answered until the mid- to late game.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Cenobite's Demerit (version #3)</strong><br />
W<br />
Enchantment — Aura<br />
Enchant creature<br />
Enchanted creature can't attack or block.<br />
<em>Corrupted</em> – At the beginning of your upkeep, if an opponent has 3 or more poison counters, gain 1 life.</p>

<p>Upgrades into <auto-card>Pacifism</auto-card> have always been a bit underwhelming, so they then changed it to a <auto-card>Pacifism</auto-card> that upgrades into a life-gaining spell.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Cenobite's Demotion (version #4)</strong><br />
2W<br />
Enchantment — Aura<br />
Enchant creature<br />
Enchanted creature can't attack or block.<br />
<em>Corrupted</em> – 2W: Exile enchanted creature and create a 1/1 colorless Phyrexian Mite artifact creature token with poisonous 1. Activate this ability only if an opponent has three or more poison counters.</p>

<p>This is Vision Design's last attempt at making a corrupted version. The previous versions were a bit weak, so we tried a version that started as a <auto-card>Pacifism</auto-card> for 2W that then upgraded to remove the creature <em>and</em> give you a Mite in exchange.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Dovishness (version #5)</strong><br />
1W<br />
Enchantment — Aura<br />
Oily 5 <em>(This enters the battlefield with five oil counters on it. At the beginning of your upkeep, remove an oil counter from it. When the last is removed, sacrifice it.)</em><br />
Enchant creature<br />
Enchanted creature can't attack or block.<br />
Remove an oil counter from CARDNAME: Attach CARDNAME to target creature. Activate this only when you could cast a sorcery.</p>

<p>At this point, the file was with Set Design (led initially by Erik Lauer but handed off to Adam Prosak after two months). Erik had taken the oiled mechanic that Vision Design turned in, which was a means to signify that a creature entered with a certain number of oiled counters, and turned it into a mechanic that matched what vanishing does (remove one counter a turn and sacrifice the permanent when you remove the last counter).</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Dovishness (version #6)</strong><br />
1W<br />
Enchantment — Aura<br />
Oily 6 <em>(This enters the battlefield with six oil counters on it. At the beginning of your upkeep, remove an oil counter from it. When the last is removed, sacrifice it.)</em><br />
Enchant creature<br />
Enchanted creature can't attack or block, and its activated abilities can't be activated.</p>

<p>Playtesting showed that the previous version was both fiddly and complicated to monitor, especially as players planned turns ahead. This version simplified things, turning <auto-card>Pacifism</auto-card> into <auto-card>Arrest</auto-card> and changing the oil counters from five to six. Note this is the first version to essentially be a 1W <auto-card>Arrest</auto-card> (although one that eventually goes away).</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Bound in Gold (version #7)</strong><br />
2W<br />
Enchantment — Aura<br />
Enchant permanent<br />
Enchanted permanent can't attack, block, or crew Vehicles, and its activated abilities can't be activated unless they're mana abilities.</p>

<p>Oily went away, so Set Design turned this into a reprint, again mostly marking the slot.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Arrest (version #8)</strong><br />
2W<br />
Enchantment — Aura<br />
Enchant creature or planeswalker<br />
Enchanted permanent can't attack or block, and its activated abilities can't be activated.</p>

<p>The card stayed a reprint but changed to a straight <auto-card>Arrest</auto-card>, I assume because dealing with planeswalkers was more important than dealing with Vehicles. (The set does have ten planeswalkers, more than any set save <em>War of the Spark</em>.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Norn's Arrest (version #9)</strong><br />
2W<br />
Enchantment — Aura<br />
Enchant artifact, creature, or planeswalker<br />
Enchanted permanent can't attack or block, and its activated abilities can't be activated.</p>

<p>The design then changed to a new version that worked on artifacts. The Phyrexians have a long association with artifacts, so there are a lot in the set. There was one important final change made by Play Design. The cost was dropped from 2W, the cost that <auto-card>Arrest</auto-card> has usually been at, to 1W. Play Design wanted to strengthen it for Limited and felt that it wouldn't have a negative impact on Constructed. (I was told by Play Design that <a class="autocard-link" data-image-url="https://media.wizards.com/2023/one/en_f0073a44ca.png">Ossification</a> is a better candidate for Constructed decks.)</p>

<p>Here's the art description for the card:</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Setting</strong>: "Lacrosse"<br />
<strong>Color</strong>: White spell<br />
<strong>Location</strong>: The Monumental Facade (pages 15–24)<br />
<strong>Intent</strong>: This card is part of a set that showcases story moments from this release. The Wanderer and Kaito have just landed on New Phyrexia, but an enemy force field has messed with their powers, and the Wanderer is fading away.<br />
<strong>Action</strong>: The Wanderer and Kaito reach out toward each other, but her arms have become transparent and pass through him. See attached references for character designs. Maybe the atmosphere is filled with poisonous dust (see pages 19 and 23). We're open to any solutions you have for a more abstract interpretation.<br />

<h2>Common Ground</h2>

<p>I hope you enjoyed my peek at the design of some of <em>Phyrexia: All Will Be</em> <em>One</em>'s commons. As always, I'm eager for any feedback, be it about the column, the cards I talked about today, or <em>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</em>. You can <a href="mailto:making.magic@hotmail.com">email</a> me or contact me through my social media accounts (<a href="https://twitter.com/maro254" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://markrosewater.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Tumblr</a>, <a href="http://instagram.com/mtgmaro" target="_blank">Instagram</a>, and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@markrosewater" target="_blank">TikTok</a>).</p>

We have all felt the possibilities of what a brand-new <em>Magic</em> card can do. With <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/products/phyrexia-all-will-be-one" target="_blank"><em>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</em></a> (ONE), we all got to embrace the villainy of Phyrexia and infuse that into <em>Magic</em> cards.</p>

<p>I'm Mike Turian, product architect for ONE. As the architect of a set, I'm responsible for the content structure and promotions within. The surreal horror of <em>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</em> was an especially joyful set to work on, and this article brings with it a breakout of what Phyrexian treatments can be found, and which <em>Magic</em> boosters they are found in.</p>

<h2><em>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</em> Collector Boosters</h2>

<p>First, let's look at ONE Collector Boosters. I've listed these in the order they appear within the booster. I'll also note that any listed percentage is rounded to the nearest whole number.</p>

<div class="figure-wrapper">

<p>Now that we have looked at the Collector Booster, let's look closer at each treatment and where we can find these cards.</p>

<p><strong>Ichor and borderless ichor cards</strong> – Sarah Wassell and Tom Jenkot, the Booster Fun art directors for ONE, worked with our artists to use a bold ink wash style to capture the essence of the Phyrexians. Adam Prosak and Grace Fong, the game and creative design team leads, selected the most Phyrexian cards in a set dripping with Phyrexia. There are 6 commons and 7 uncommons that have a bordered ichor treatment, and there are 16 rares and 11 mythic rares with a borderless ichor treatment. You will be able to find these ichor cards in Set, Draft, and Collector Boosters as well as select cards in the Collector Booster Sample Packs that come with Commander decks.</p>

<p><strong>Phyrexian-language cards</strong> – For those Phyrexian fans out there who are learning to read Phyrexian as they take over the Multiverse, there are five mythic rare planeswalkers in ONE, each with Phyrexian-language text and the Phyrexian frame. These are the five Planeswalkers that have been corrupted and Phyrexianized. In addition, we have Elesh Norn, Mother of Machines available in this style. These six cards can each be found in Set, Draft, and Collector Boosters.</p>

<p><strong>Borderless concept praetors</strong> – With <em>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</em> celebrating the glory that is all of Phyrexia, we wanted to make sure that the five praetors each appeared within the set. We went back to the start of their creation and have brought to life Richard Whitters's concept illustrations of each praetor with these borderless concept praetors. Each features the card from the set they were most recently in; so Vorinclex, Monstrous Raider is a new illustration for the <em>Kaldheim </em>praetor and is tournament legal where that card already is.</p>

<p>Here is a look at all five that you can find in Set, Draft, and Collector Boosters.</p>

<p><strong>Borderless manga cards</strong> – To capture the intimidation and fear that the Phyrexians have wrought upon the Multiverse, the art team tapped into a horror manga style that highlights the aggression of the Phyrexians well. We worked with Kogado Studios, our Japanese partner studio, to bring this style to life. You will find each of the five compleated Planeswalkers as well as "what-if?" versions for five Planeswalkers who haven't been Phyrexianized in the borderless manga treatment. In addition, we brought five legendary Mirran creatures into this style to further the speculation as to what those heroes would have looked like if compleated.</p>

<p><strong>Junji Ito's Elesh Norn </strong>– In addition to these 15 cards, we had the opportunity to pair the ultimate manga Horror artist, Junji Ito, with the star of <em>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</em>, Elesh Norn. Together, they created this phenomenal <em>Magic</em> card:</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>All of the borderless manga cards can be opened in Set, Draft, and Collector Boosters. Additionally, there are select borderless manga cards available in Collector Booster Sample Packs that come with the Commander decks.</p>

<p><strong>Step-and-compleat foils</strong> – As we went to capture the monolithic power and vision of the Phyrexians, we used the step-and-compleat treatment to highlight the Phyrexian symbol with a special laminate. The Phyrexian symbol dances in the light accenting the 67 cards available in this style. The step-and-compleat foil treatment is available on borderless ichor cards, borderless concept praetors, borderless manga cards, and Phyrexian-language cards. The Junji Ito-illustrated Elesh Norn with the step-and-compleat foil treatment is a sight to behold!</p>

<p>These cards can only be found in ONE Collector Boosters, and you get one step-and-compleat foil in each Collector Booster.</p>

<p><strong>Extended art</strong> – For each set, we want to make sure that each rare and mythic rare gets a special treatment. For those cards that don't have one of the treatments above, we use our extended-art treatment to highlight more of the art. With ONE, there are 29 rares from the main set, 5 new rares from <em>Jumpstart</em>, and the new rare or mythic rare cards from the ONC Commander decks that can be found with the extended-art treatment. You can open all of these cards in Collector Boosters, as well as select extended-art Commander cards in the Collector Booster Sample Packs that come with Commander decks.</p>

<p><strong>Borderless dual lands</strong> – Found in Set, Draft, and Collector Boosters, borderless dual lands bring the surreal dark beauty of Phyrexian landscapes to life. As lead designer of <em>Scars of Mirrodin</em>, I'm especially pleased to see this cycle of five "fast lands" return to Standard with new beautiful artwork.</p>

<h2><em>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</em> Bundle: Compleat Edition</h2>

<p>In addition to the regular Bundle, <em>Phyrexia: All Will Be One </em>features the Bundle: Compleat Edition, which will be released a few weeks later on March 3, 2023.</p>

<div class="figure-wrapper">

<p>As part of that product, there are new oil slick raised foils and one more Phyrexian-language card in addition to the six found in <em>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</em> boosters. The promo card in the Bundle: Compleat Edition is a Phyrexian Arena promo card with Phyrexian-language text and a Phyrexian frame. Even long after Phyrexian Arena's debut in <em>Apocalypse</em>, paying 1 life for one card each turn remains a good deal!</p>

<p><strong>Oil slick raised foils</strong> – Along with the amazing treatments above, we wanted to come up with one final way to celebrate the glory of Phyrexia. Along with lots of fun goodies and a sleek box, each Bundle: Compleat Edition comes with twelve <em>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</em> Set Boosters and one Compleat Edition Booster.</p>

<p>Inside the Compleat Edition Booster, you will get 10 oil slick raised foil basic lands (two of each basic land type) and two <em>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</em> mythic rares. These two oil slick raised foil mythic rares will be randomized and come out of a possible 20 mythic rares, which are the same 20 mythic rares found in <em>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</em>.</p>

<p>Here's how they look:</p>

<p>Awesome to open and quickly expand your <em>Magic</em> collection, each ONE Set Booster contains 12 <em>Magic</em> cards, one art card, and one token/ad card <em>or</em> a card from <em>The List</em> (a special card selected from <em>Magic</em>'s history or "Universes Within" card—found in 25% of boosters).</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Set Booster Breakdown" src="https://media.wizards.com/2023/images/daily/en_LskL2ZBrbPdC.jpg" /></p>

<p>A ONE Set Booster includes a combination of 1–4 card(s) with a rarity of rare or higher and 3–7 uncommons, 3–7 commons, and 1 basic land. A traditional foil basic land replaces the basic land in 20% of Set Boosters, and a foil-stamped signature art card replaces the art card in 10% of ONE Set Boosters. (A traditional foil borderless mythic rare planeswalker can be found in less than 1% of ONE Set Boosters.)</p>

New Phyrexia is in full bloom, and while the praetors may have some minor disagreements on the best way forward, and while there may be some Planeswalkers showing up to ruin everything, and while there may still be some Mirrans running around planning to take their plane back, what part of inevitable is unclear? All will be one. No set is compleat without new mechanics though, so let's take a look.</p>

<h2>Toxic</h2>

<iframe width="850" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gn6uzoSWxu4" title="ONE Mechanic | Toxic" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>

<p>Can't you see Phyrexia's calling? Creatures like these should wear a warning. They're dangerous, and falling victim to them might have you succumbing to a poisonous fate, no matter what your life total is. Toxic is a new keyword ability found on several Phyrexian creatures in this set, including the terrifying Paladin of Predation.</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Paladin of Predation" src="https://media.wizards.com/2023/one/en_93aceeb707.png" style="width: 265px; height: 370px;" /></p>

<p>Any time a creature with toxic deals combat damage to a player, that player gets a number of poison counters equal to the <em>toxic value</em> of that creature. That's the number after the toxic keyword. These poison counters are handed out in addition to the damage being dealt, so bad news for that player on multiple axes. A player with ten or more poison counters loses the game, but in the next section, we'll learn that advantages for poisoning your opponents kick in much sooner.</p>

<p>A creature's toxic value and its power aren't necessarily connected. If a creature with toxic 6 deals 1 combat damage to an opponent, they're getting six poison counters. 15 combat damage? Still six poison counters. Toxic doesn't help if the creature deals combat damage to another creature or a planeswalker.</p>

<h2>Corrupted</h2>

<iframe width="850" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WDCZZRv6xzU" title="ONE Mechanic | Corrupted" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>

<p>Poison counters have been a long-time favorite for alternate-win conditions, but outside of a few individual cards, it's mostly been all or nothing. If you couldn't deliver the tenth poison counter, the first nine didn't matter much. Corrupted is a new ability word that highlights abilities that make cards stronger if an opponent has three or more poison counters.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<div class="resizing-cig" style="min-width:275px; width:25%; float:left;">
<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="The Seedcore" src="https://media.wizards.com/2023/one/en_2f469ea9c0.png" style="width: 265px; height: 370px;"></p>
</div>

<div class="resizing-cig" style="min-width:275px; width:25%; float:left;">
<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Extended Art" src="https://media.wizards.com/2023/one/en_bed2bfcb06.png" style="width: 265px; height: 370px;"></p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Some corrupted abilities, like The Seedcore's last ability, are activated. If you have a corrupted opponent, you can activate the ability, and if you don't, you can't. Other corrupted abilities, such as the last ability of Skrelv's Hive, are static, and their effects are active as long as an opponent has three or more poison counters. In multiplayer games, you need only one opponent to have three or more poison counters, not all of them.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<div class="resizing-cig" style="min-width:275px; width:25%; float:left;">
<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Skrelv's Hive" src="https://media.wizards.com/2023/one/en_acc3e52c76.png" style="width: 265px; height: 370px;"></p>
</div>

<div class="resizing-cig" style="min-width:275px; width:25%; float:left;">
<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Extended Art" src="https://media.wizards.com/2023/one/en_0beb0c5505.png" style="width: 265px; height: 370px;"></p>
</div>
</div>

<p>You'll also find instants and sorceries with corrupted abilities. Some of these abilities provide additional effects if you have a corrupted opponent as the spell resolves. Others affect what a spell costs or what it can target. Corrupted abilities are flexible, and each card will tell you what specific reward—other than ridiculous fun—handing out those poisoning counters can have.</p>

<h2>For Mirrodin!</h2>

<iframe width="850" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yNZ8vNly-WQ" title="ONE Mechanic | For Mirrodin!" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>

<p>The Mirrans aren't quite conceding this fight just yet. For Mirrodin! is a new triggered ability found on some Equipment cards that come complete (<em>not</em> the other spelling) with their own wielder.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<div class="resizing-cig" style="min-width:275px; width:25%; float:left;">
<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Blade of Shared Souls" src="https://media.wizards.com/2023/one/en_7cfc4ee112.png" style="width: 265px; height: 370px;"></p>
</div>

<div class="resizing-cig" style="min-width:275px; width:25%; float:left;">
<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Extended Art" src="https://media.wizards.com/2023/one/en_3cb4a228c5.png" style="width: 265px; height: 370px;"></p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Equipment enters the battlefield unattached like other Equipment. If for some reason it leaves the battlefield before the triggered ability resolves, you'll still create the Rebel creature token, although they'll be sadly empty-handed. Equipment with For Mirrodin! behaves just like other Equipment. You can use the equip ability to attach such an Equipment onto another creature you control.</p>

<h2>Oil Counters</h2>

<iframe width="850" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IuwbU9FRbbg" title="ONE Mechanic | Oil Counters" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>

<p>Although oil counters aren't a keyword ability, and they have no inherent rules meaning, they play a key role in Phyrexia's operation. Some cards, such as Urabrask's Forge, put oil counters on themselves and then use those counters for various effects.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<div class="resizing-cig" style="min-width:275px; width:25%; float:left;">
<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Urabrask's Forge" src="https://media.wizards.com/2023/one/en_69b13a39cb.png" style="width: 265px; height: 370px;"></p>
</div>

<div class="resizing-cig" style="min-width:275px; width:25%; float:left;">
<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Extended Art" src="https://media.wizards.com/2023/one/en_b74858e417.png" style="width: 265px; height: 370px;"></p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Other cards care about how many permanents you control with oil counters on them. Still others move oil counters around. Things get slippery very, very quickly.</p>

<h2>Proliferate</h2>

<iframe width="850" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xFFTPFPxy9Y" title="ONE Mechanic | Proliferate" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>

<p>Proliferate is a featured returning keyword action in this set, and it's no surprise: there are oil counters, poison counters, and wouldn't it be great if there were more of them? Any time you're instructed to proliferate, you choose any number of players or permanents that already have counters on them. For each one, and for each kind of counter it has, add another one.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<div class="resizing-cig" style="min-width:275px; width:25%; float:left;">
<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Experimental Augury" src="https://media.wizards.com/2023/one/en_9a364f301c.png" style="width: 265px; height: 370px;"></p>
</div>

<div class="resizing-cig" style="min-width:275px; width:25%; float:left;">
<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Promo Pack" src="https://media.wizards.com/2023/one/en_21c1b1378f.png" style="width: 265px; height: 370px;"></p>
</div>
</div>

<p>For example, if you control a creature with a +1/+1 counter and an oil counter on it, and you chose it while proliferating, it would end up with two +1/+1 counters and two oil counters. If you and your opponent each controlled a planeswalker, you could choose yours to get another loyalty counter while not choosing theirs to do the same. If you controlled a creature with a +1/+1 counter and a stun counter (a counter you might not want to add another of), you have a choice: add one of each kind of counter it has or add nothing.</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Urtet, Remnant of Memnarch" src="https://media.wizards.com/2023/one/en_11e879baac.png" style="width: 265px; height: 370px;" /> <img alt="Extended-Art Urtet, Remnant of Memnarch" src="https://media.wizards.com/2023/one/en_4699e6545c.png" style="width: 265px; height: 370px;" /></p>

<p>These card images are correct. The Urtet, Remnant of Memnarch <em>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</em> Commander version (found in Set Boosters) will drop as a mythic rare. Meanwhile, the extended-art Urtet, Remnant of Memnarch (found only in Collector Boosters) will drop as a rare. Both versions will be legal for play in Commander, Vintage, and Legacy.</p>

I'm going to introduce the Exploratory Design and Vision Design teams, start telling the story of the set's design, and show off two cool new preview cards. It's an interesting story, so let's get to it.</p>

<h2>The Compleat Story</h2>

<p>Before I begin telling the story of <em>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</em>'s design, I would first like to introduce the Exploratory Design and Vision Design teams who worked on the set. Next week, I'll introduce you to the Set Design team. As always, I have the lead designer of the team(s) do the introductions, and for this set, that was me.</p>

&nbsp;
<p><strong>Mark Rosewater (exploratory design and vision design – lead)</strong></p>

<p>I'm a huge fan of the Phyrexians. My favorite set before I came to work for Wizards was <em>Antiquities</em> (where the Phyrexians premiered). When Michael and I created The <em>Weatherlight</em> Saga, we made the Phyrexians the main villains. I chose to lead the design for <em>Scars of Mirrodin</em>, which reintroduced the Phyrexians. So, when it came time for us to make the Phyrexian set, the one expansion of the story actually set on New Phyrexia, I knew I had to lead it. I'm glad I did as I'm very happy with how it turned out.</p>

<p><strong>Doug Beyer (exploratory design and vision design – strong second)</strong></p>

<p>Doug is on most Vision Design teams as the representative of the Creative team. While we figure out what the set is mechanically about, Doug and his team are figuring out how to build the world and story. On this set, though, Doug had an additional role, a pretty big one. He was my strong second for both exploratory design and vision design. Doug did this as preparation for leading the vision design for "Rugby" (coming out this year). This was Doug's first time as a strong second, and he did an excellent job.</p>

<p><strong>Ari Nieh (vision design)</strong></p>

<p>It's become kind of cliché to call Ari a great designer (as she was the winner of <em>Great Designer Search 3</em>), but it's still true. Ari was super helpful in vision design with asking some big-picture questions that helped us get the design to where it was handed off. I'm grateful that Ari was on the team and enjoyed all of her insight.</p>

<p><strong>Bryan Hawley (vision design)</strong></p>

<p>Bryan was on the team as the play design representative, making sure that the decision we made in vision design would be something Play Design could work with downstream. I could always rely on Bryan to help with costs and balancing the file for playtesting <em>and </em>provide the larger play design perspective.</p>

<p><strong>Graeme Hopkins (exploratory design and vision design)</strong></p>

<p>Graeme is another designer that first came to Wizards through the <em>Great Designer Search</em> (the first one in Graeme's case). Graeme works for the <em>MTG Arena</em> team, but we luckily get to borrow him for design teams from time to time. Graeme has a great design sense and always makes cards that make me smile when I see them.</p>

<p><strong>Ken Nagle (exploratory design and vision design)</strong></p>

<p>Ken is the third <em>Great Designer Search</em> alum on this design team (he was a finalist along with Graeme in the first GDS). Ken is a firehose of ideas, and it's always great having him on a design team. Due to other projects, I hadn't worked with Ken on a design team in a while, so it was great to get to work with him again.</p>

<p><strong>Sydney Adams (exploratory design and vision design)</strong></p>

<p>Sydney works for the Creative team, but I was lucky enough to get to borrow her for exploratory design and vision design. I always enjoy working with her because she approaches the design of the cards from a novel vantage point that results in her making cards uniquely her own.</p>

<p><strong>Zak Elsik (exploratory design)</strong></p>

<p>Zak was the Play Design representative for exploratory design. That's usually the most challenging time for a play designer, as the ideas are the wildest and the least tied to reality. Zak did a great job of helping us figure out which ideas had the germs of concepts that could lead to mechanics which could functionally work in a way that allowed Play Design to make exciting cards out of them.</p>

</div>

<p>When we first came up with the idea of the Phyrexian storyline, we asked ourselves: how much of the Phyrexians were we going to see? While they're a fan-favorite villain, the Phyrexians can get a bit dark, and we were aware that in too much volume they might be problematic. We ended up deciding that the Phyrexians would play a role in some of the sets (especially the later ones), but wouldn't be most of any set, save one. If we were doing a Phyrexian storyline, we had to have one set that focused on them. For fans of the Phyrexians, we needed to have a Phyrexian set that dives into all things Phyrexian.</p>

<p>It made sense that this set would be the return to New Phyrexia, the current plane the Phyrexians reside on, one where they've been trapped for many years. Most of the inhabitants are Phyrexians, save for the small handful of Mirran rebels that have managed to survive. The challenge for this set was to make fans of Phyrexia happy while appealing to those who aren't as big fans.</p>

<p>Early on, we decided the theme we liked was "being Phyrexian is fun." In every other set, the Phyrexians are the villains you fight against, but in this set, you get to take on the point of view of the Phyrexians. We wanted the style of play to feel Phyrexian while providing enjoyable gameplay. We started by figuring out what exactly fans of Phyrexia would expect of the set. Here was the list of everything mechanical we'd previously tied to the Phyrexians:</p>

<p><strong>Poison/Infect</strong> – Poison was introduced as an alternative-win mechanic in <em>Legends</em>. We made the occasional card with it for a few years but eventually removed it from the game. I spent years trying to bring it back, ultimately succeeding in <em>Scars of Mirrodin</em> as a key weapon of the Phyrexians. The version we used in the <em>Scars of Mirrodin</em> block was infect, where the creature dealt its damage to creatures in the form of -1/-1 counters and to players in the form of poison counters.</p>

<p><strong>-1/-1 Counters</strong> – Because the <em>Scars of Mirrodin</em> block was using infect, we used -1/-1 counters rather than +1/+1 counters. (A set usually focuses on one major counter, usually +1/+1 counters.) This allowed us to make other cards, ones without infect, that made use of -1/-1 counters. All of those cards were flavored as being Phyrexian. This tied into a "Phyrexian as disease" motif that was a big part thematically in the <em>Scars of Mirrodin</em> block.</p>

<p><strong>Proliferate</strong> – This was the other Phyrexian-themed mechanic, which ran through all of the <em>Scars of Mirrodin</em> block. It was designed to play well with all the -1/-1 and poison counters generated by infect. Proliferate would be brought back in <em>War of the Spark</em>, this time interacting with loyalty (the set had a Planeswalker theme with 36 planeswalker cards) and +1/+1 counters. Proliferate is one of the more popular mechanics with the <em>Magic</em> audience.</p>

<p><strong>Phyrexian mana</strong> – This is mana for which you can spend either a color or 2 life. It was used in <em>New Phyrexia</em> and ended up seeing a lot of Constructed play, as it's a powerful mechanic. Of everything on this list, this was what concerned Play Design the most.</p>

<p><strong>Life payments</strong> – This had been a theme we tied to Phyrexians in the <em>Scars of Mirrodin</em> block. Phyrexian mana was created partially because of this theme.</p>

<p><strong>Death triggers</strong> – This was another theme we tied to the Phyrexians in the <em>Scars of Mirrodin</em> block. Death was but another resource harnessed by the Phyrexians.</p>

<p><strong>Artifact synergy</strong> – Phyrexians first showed up in <em>Antiquities</em>, which has a strong artifact theme. Since their beginning, Phyrexians have been closely associated with artifacts. In <em>New Phyrexia</em>, there was a cycle of artifact creatures with Phyrexian mana, and there were other artifact creatures that had Phyrexian mana for activation costs.</p>

<p><strong>Sacrificing permanents</strong> – This was another theme we tied to Phyrexia in the <em>Scars of Mirrodin</em> block.</p>

<p><strong>Living Weapon</strong> – This was a mechanic that first showed up in <em>Mirrodin Besieged</em>. It went on Equipment that entered with a 0/0 black Germ creature token that it attached to. All of them were tied thematically to the Phyrexians.</p>

<p>Once we had the list, we then asked ourselves the following question: which of these would the audience expect of a Phyrexia set? We ended up agreeing that three stood at the top: poison, Phyrexian mana, and proliferate. We called them the three P's.</p>

<p>The first version of the design file had all three. The low-hanging fruit for poison was to bring back infect. There was some skepticism, both in that R&amp;D has soured on environments using -1/-1 counters and because infect is disliked by many (it's a very polarizing mechanic), but infect has its fans, so I thought we should start by seeing if infect could work out. The one change we made was with Phyrexian mana. Instead of using it in mana costs, we used it in activations. This helped it avoid causing color-pie issues and made it a bit easier to balance, as it no longer sped up how quickly the card could be cast.</p>

<p>The first playtest played like the original<em> Scars of Mirrodin</em> block and did a lot to remind us of some its problems—the biggest being the bifurcation of poison. Either you played a poison deck or you didn't. The lack of synergy between cards dealing damage and cards granting poison made you play one or the other, but not both.</p>

<p>Our first solution to this problem was to introduce an ability word called corrupted. Corrupted made cards better if the opponent had three or more poison counters. The idea being that we could encourage decks that wanted to poison the opponent a little. And then some of the time you got enough poison in that maybe you killed the opponent with poison even if that wasn't what your deck did most of the time.</p>

<p>It was at this point that Ari suggested we switch from infect to poisonous. Poisonous had been an ability we "previewed" on two futureshifted cards in <em>Future Sight</em>. Whenever a creature with poisonous N dealt combat damage to a player, it would give them N poison counters. It lacked the dynamic connection infect had to power (<auto-card mvid="583767">Giant Growthing</auto-card> a creature with infect would raise how much poison it gave), but it stopped the siloing between damage and poison. When you attacked with a poisonous creature, you were still advancing toward a death with damage. The set would be handed over with poisonous as the keyword. Next week, I'll explain why and how it changed to toxic.</p>

<p>Moving away from infect allowed us to do a couple other things as well. One, we could stop using -1/-1 counters. I was skeptical I could convince Set Design and Play Design to commit to another -1/-1 counter environment. Two, it allowed us to do something different with proliferate. In the first playtest, proliferate had played exactly as it had in the <em>Scars of Mirrodin</em> block, which was mostly about killing creatures and players. I had really enjoyed that in <em>War of the Spark</em> proliferate could sometimes be positive and about building things up rather than always about breaking things down.</p>

<p>This led to the idea of having a new counter type. Instead of using +1/+1 counters or -1/-1 counters, we'd use oil counters. Oil counters were basically blank counters that we could use in various ways. They could mark several uses of an ability, they could help you build up (both for scaling and threshold abilities), they could help you count down, or they could change the size of a creature or the power of an effect. They could be quite flexible.</p>

<p>The one thing we agreed on was that we wanted them to play nicely with proliferate, so having more should be better than having fewer. This meant for example, if we wanted a creature to only last three turns, we would start with three counters and count down, rather than counting up and having removal when you get to three counters. This way, using proliferate would grant you an extra turn with the creature.</p>

<p>This led us to make a mechanic we called oiled:</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier">Oiled 4 (<em>CARDNAME enters with four oil counters and gets an oil counter when empty if you proliferate</em>.)</p>

<p>Oiled did two things. It allowed a creature to enter with a certain number of counters, and it worked with proliferate to get you a counter when empty. This was to help fight the tension between using the last oil counter on a card. While oil counters made it to the set, oiled did not. I'll talk next week about why it went away.</p>

<p>We ended up using Phyrexian mana in two ways. One, we put it in activation costs. Two, we made a new mechanic called relentless that used it as a cost. Here's an example of relentless:</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier"><strong>Grim Determination</strong><br />
4B<br />
Sorcery<br />
Return target creature card from your graveyard to the battlefield.<br />
Relentless 4(p/b)(p/b)(p/b) <em>(If you cast this spell from your hand, exile it as it resolves. You may cast it from exile for its relentless cost if you've played a land that turn.)</em></p>

<p>The idea behind relentless was that we wanted to capture the sense of the Phyrexians never stopping. Relentless was a flashback variant that allowed you to play a spell twice. But instead of just being a mana gate, relentless only allowed you to cast it from exile (it kind of worked backwards from flashback in that regard) if you'd played a land that turn. All relentless costs made use of Phyrexian mana. Relentless was added to get a spell mechanic into the set. Like oiled, it didn't make it into the final set. I'll talk more about that next week.</p>

<p>The one last thing we did was find a mechanic for the rebels. While most of the inhabitants of New Phyrexia were Phyrexians, there were still a few Mirrans who had managed to survive. We wanted to represent them in the set, ideally as a draft archetype, and we felt they deserved a mechanic all their own.</p>

<p>The idea we were enamored with was finding something Phyrexian that we could twist into a mechanic for the rebels. We liked the idea that surviving meant co-opting something Phyrexian. Looking back at our list, the most Phyrexian thing that we weren't using was living weapon. What if we redid it but changed the 0/0 Germ into something else? Well, why not a Rebel?</p>

<p>Rebel, the creature type, first showed up on white creatures in <em>Mercadian Masques</em> along with an unnamed mechanic that allowed you to fetch other creatures. We'd talked about bringing back the creature type but hadn't found the right spot for it. (The closest was the rebels in <em>Battle for Zendikar </em>who were fighting the Eldrazi, but they were creature type Ally.) This seemed like the place to finally bring it back.</p>

<p>We liked the idea of the token creature being a bit bigger, as it solved one of the problems of living weapon where every Equipment had to grant toughness. 2/2 was our first attempt at the right size. It played well, and we never looked back. In vision design, we called the mechanic take up arms. (We didn't yet have the exclamation point technology.)</p>

<p>At the time of vision design handoff, the set had poisonous, corrupted, oil counters, oiled, relentless, and take up arms. In part two of this column, I'll explain what Set Design did with each of these mechanics.</p>

<p>Before I go, I have two preview cards to show off. One with toxic (what poisonous became) and proliferate. And the other with oil counters.</p>

<p>This card is a great example of how this set can mix and match damage and poison. How will you kill your opponent with Bloated Contaminator? It's got toxic and proliferate, so it's capable of killing with poison, but it's also a trampling 4/4. This set does a good job of giving you decks that don't always end up killing your opponent in the same way, so the order of what gets played can change the strategy of individual cards. Also, the existence of corrupted means sometimes your plan is never to give them ten poison counters but just three.</p>

<p>One of the things I most enjoy about oil counters is their flexibility. Existing as mostly markers, they allow the designers a lot of freedom in how they use them. This card shows that they are a resource and that different decks will be able to manipulate them in ways that lead to compelling gameplay.</p>

Today, I'm going to introduce you to the Set Design team, walk you through the set design, and show off two preview cards. So, let's get to it. By the way, if "Part 2" didn't give it away, this is the second article in a series, so you might want to go <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/making-magic/phyrexia-all-will-be-one-direction-part-1" target="_blank">read the first one</a> if you haven't already.</p>

<h2>All for ONE</h2>

<p>Last week, I introduced the designers from the Exploratory Design and the Vision Design teams. Today, I'm going to introduce you to the Set Design team. As always, I have the lead designer of the set (in this case Adam Prosak) introduce their team. I'll first introduce Adam, and then Adam will introduce everyone else.</p>

	<div>
&nbsp;
<p><strong>Adam Prosak (lead)</strong> – Adam has led the set design for <em>Core Set 2021</em>, <em>Modern Horizons</em> (the first one), and <em>Innistrad: Crimson Vow</em>. This is the second set where I've led the vision design and handed off to Adam doing the set design (with the other time being <em>Innistrad: Crimson Vow</em>). I enjoyed watching how he takes the vision of a set and brings it to life. Adam has a lot of passion and is good at figuring out the core of the vision, trimming away the unnecessary to get to the essence of what will make the set shine. I'm very happy with what he's done with ONE. (Again, this is me, Mark, writing this blurb. All the rest are written by Adam.)</p>

<p><strong>Erik Lauer (lead)</strong> – Erik is one of the most accomplished <em>Magic</em> designers ever. The list of sets for which he's led the final design is enormous. Erik was the lead for the first few months of set design, helping the transition from the "try new things" ethos of Vision Design to the "execute on the new things" ethos of Set Design.</p>

<p><strong>Oliver Tiu</strong> – Oliver was very new to the Play Design team when he joined the ONE team and instrumental in helping to ensure the early playtests were valuable. Oliver is an exceptionally strong tournament player who has shown a natural ability to design cool cards.</p>

<p><strong>Reggie</strong> <strong>Valk</strong> – Reggie's greatest strength is in finding uses for underutilized cards. He is good at making sure every card has a home for someone. Reggie did great work on the early portion of set design, helping to bring the mechanics to life.</p>

<p><strong>Daniel Holt</strong> – If you like the way our<em> Magic</em> cards look, Daniel is likely responsible. When he's not working on things such as frames and set symbols, he enjoys designing and playing Commander.</p>

<p><strong>Ken Nagle</strong> – One of the original great designers (he started at Wizards after the first<em> Great Designer Search</em>), Ken is best known for his off-the-wall designs. The more unique the design, the more likely Ken was responsible.</p>

<p><strong>Carmen Handy</strong> – Carmen really likes Phyrexia. Carmen is great at making <em>Magic</em> cards. A known enjoyer of competitive infect decks and curator of a proliferate-themed cube, Carmen was the perfect addition to the Set Design team. Her combination of Phyrexian knowledge, skill at designing fun <em>Magic</em> cards, and ability to provide game-balance insights is unmatched.</p>

<p><strong>Patrick Sullivan</strong> – One of <em>Magic</em>'s most colorful tournament commentators, Patrick brought years of experience from the gaming industry to the team.</p>

<p><strong>Mark Gottlieb</strong> – When I think of Mark, I think of a puzzler extraordinaire. Mark is well known for hiding secret puzzles into his presentations, and he's always trying to find and design combinations of cards.</p>

<p><strong>Michael Majors</strong> – Michael is one of the Eternal format experts within the Play Design team. One of his roles was to help guide some designs that could have implications for Pioneer, Modern, Legacy, etc. This is not to overstate his ability to craft environments. His work on the ONE Limited and Standard environments was top-notch, as it always is.</p>

<p><strong>John Penick</strong> – At this time, John primarily worked on another game—<em>Spellslingers</em>. Many times, designers will swap between different teams and projects so that we can learn about what other teams are doing. John spent some time with the <em>Phyrexia</em> Set Design team and provided a unique perspective.</p>

<p><strong>Annie Sardelis</strong> – Annie started at Wizards as part of our Worldbuilding team. After showing off her skills as a card designer, she's moved over to the card design team full time. Annie was the lead of the ONE<em> Jumpstart</em> product, so we worked together to make the main set and the <em>Jumpstart</em> set synergize as much as we could.</p>

<p><strong>Andrew Brown</strong> – Andrew is the technical lead of the Play Design team. He joins each Set Design team to help each set make the right type of impact for Standard. I often "save" spots in the card file so that Andrew can use them to sculpt Standard.</p>

<h2>ONE Singular Sensation</h2>

<p>When Vision Design handed off the file to Set Design, here's what we gave them:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Poisonous</li>
	<li>Corrupted</li>
	<li>Oil counters (including oiled)</li>
	<li>Take up arms</li>
	<li>Phyrexian mana (including relentless)</li>
	<li>Proliferate</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm going to walk through what happened with each of these mechanics.</p>

<h3>Poisonous</h3>

<p><a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/making-magic/phyrexia-all-will-be-one-direction-part-1" target="_blank">As I explained last week</a>, the Vision Design team decided to use oil counters instead of -1/-1 counters (or +1/+1 counters), which meant we weren't able to do infect. Instead, we decided to use the poisonous mechanic that had shown up on two cards in <em>Future Sight</em>.</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Snake Cult Initiation" src="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=130708&type=card" /> <img alt="Virulent Sliver" src="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=130644&type=card" /></p>

<p>The Set Design team liked how poisonous played. They mostly kept it to the three colors Vision Design had focused it in (white, black, and green) but did sprinkle it a little in blue. White tends to only grant one poison, black goes up to two poison, and green gets higher numbers (up to six, I believe). There is one change they made, but it's a little subtler: poisonous became toxic. What exactly is the difference, and why did they change it? Here are the two abilities side by side:</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier">Poisonous 1 <em>(Whenever a Sliver deals combat damage to a player, that player gets a poison counter.)</em></p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier">Toxic 1 <em>(Players dealt combat damage by this creature also get a poison counter.)</em></p>

<p>The major change is poisonous is triggered and toxic is not. This is a big deal for digital play. For example, a while back we changed deathtouch to not be triggered. Poisonous had only appeared on two cards (both "futureshifted" hints at a possible future), so the team didn't feel obligated to keep the old template and instead used a template that matched modern standards.</p>

<p>The one other poison-related thing Vision Design had turned over—Mites, 1/1 white artifact creature tokens with poisonous 1 and "this creature can't block" stayed, with the only change being poisonous becoming toxic. Apart from a single black card, Mites appear on white cards. This tied into white only having toxic 1 creatures, as its poison strategy is about overwhelming the opponent with a wave of toxic creatures. Green, in contrast, is about having fewer creatures but with larger toxic numbers. Black sits in between white and green.</p>

<h3>Corrupted</h3>

<p>Corrupted is an ability word that tells you the card has a bonus if an opponent has three or more poison counters. Vision Design put this in to help poison have less of an "all or nothing" feel. When your opponent poisons you, now you're not sure exactly what they're up to. Also, it allows decks whose main goal is about getting their opponent to three poison counters to occasionally have games where they can win through poison. Vision Design suggested this being the white-black draft archetype.</p>

<p>When I interviewed Adam for this article, he said he thought corrupted was the key to making the set work. He liked what we had done during vision design, and Set Design didn't change much strategy-wise but rather focused on making the best execution.</p>

<h3>Oil Counters (Including Oiled)</h3>

<p>An important part of vision design is giving Set Design a series of tools to build the set with. Sometimes we spell out how we think the mechanic should be used, and sometimes we go broad and offer up a spectrum of possible uses. Oil counters are an example of the latter. In the handoff document (which I'll put in an upcoming article), we just offered up a lot of possible ways to use oil counters and left it up to Set Design to figure out which of those executions would serve the set most. It's important to remember that oil counters have no inherent mechanical meaning, which means there are numerous ways to use them.</p>

<p>Included with this list of options, we had a mechanic we called oiled:</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;font-family:courier">Oiled N (<em>CARDNAME enters with N oil counters and gets an oil counter when empty if you proliferate</em>.)</p>

<p>The idea behind oiled was that we had enough cards that entered with some number of oil counters to consolidate them with a keyword. Then to lessen some tension with proliferate, we added a rider that let you get an oil counter even if the card didn't have one.</p>

<p>Of the various options, here's the mechanical executions Set Design decided to use with oil counters:</p>

<p><strong>Use limit</strong> – These are cards that get oil counters, sometimes when they enter the battlefield, sometimes as an activated or triggered ability, that then let you spend counters for some ability or effect. This is similar to energy except they're counters that exist on the permanents rather than you, the player, and aren't interchangeable.</p>

<p><strong>Set scalable effect</strong> – These are cards where the oil counters dictate how big of an effect something is. These cards usually have a means to gain counters, so the effect can grow over time.</p>

<p><strong>Threshold</strong> – These are cards that gain abilities, but only if you have a certain number of oil counters.</p>

<p><strong>Countdown</strong> – These are cards that start with oil counters, but then lose them, usually one a turn. When you remove the last oil counter, the card goes away.</p>

<p><strong>Marker</strong> – These are cards that care about whether you have some number of cards with an oil counter. Some are threshold, some are scaling. There are a few cards that care about you using the oil counters.</p>

<p>The one truism about oil counters, which was set during vision design and stayed true during set design, is that more counters are better than less, so they all work with proliferate. This means, for instance, you want to countdown to destruction rather than count up. Set Design focused oil counters in blue, red, and green.</p>

<p>The oiled keyword went through some changes. When the file was first handed off to Set Design, Erik Lauer, who was leading it at the time, turned oiled into a version of vanished where the oil counters got removed one a turn and the creature died when you removed the last counter. Set Design removed oiled for simplicity and because they didn't plan to have too many countdown permanents with oil counters. It was decided it was okay for there to be some tension about when to remove your last oil counter from a permanent.</p>

<h3>Take Up Arms</h3>

<p>The set was mostly Phyrexians, but there were still a few Mirrans that have managed to keep from getting compleated. We thought it was only right that the rebels got their own mechanic. We liked the idea of them tweaking a Phyrexian mechanic. As I explained last week, we chose living weapon as it wasn't being used anywhere else in the set. We called the mechanic take up arms and it created a 2/2 red Rebel rather than a 0/0 black germ. It turns out having a token with power and toughness made the designs a lot easier and allowed us more variety.</p>

<p>Set Design liked take up arms and didn't really change it. They made a bunch of new individual card designs, but the core mechanic never changed. The Creative team would rename the mechanic For Mirrodin!</p>

<h3>Phyrexian Mana (Including Relentless)</h3>

<p>Phyrexian mana was in a weird spot. It was one of the most iconic Phyrexian mechanics, and the only one with "Phyrexian" in its name, but also the one that had caused the most play design issues. Vision Design's attempts to use Phyrexian mana came in three versions:</p>

<p><strong>Phyrexian planeswalkers</strong> – The larger plan has always been for Tamiyo to get Phyrexianized in <em>Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty</em>, Ajani in <em>Dominaria United</em>, and five more in <em>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</em>. When the set was in vision design, we hadn't yet finalized how the Phyrexian planeswalkers were going to work. I'd been tasked with pitching several suggestions for how to do it. My favorite was Phyrexian loyalty were you could pay life instead of loyalty counters, but that ended up being too hard to balance, so they settled on a version with Phyrexian mana in its mana cost, which basically cost you loyalty in addition to life, and this allowed Play Design to balance them. By the time set design started, we'd settled on an execution, and they worked to make the five planeswalkers from this set following that template. The five Phyrexian planeswalkers are the only cards in the set with Phyrexian mana in their mana costs.</p>

<p><strong>Activation costs</strong> – One of the biggest issues with Phyrexian mana was that it was seldom a choice. If you couldn't pay the mana, you almost always paid the 2 life. Vision Design thought activated abilities would be a better home for Phyrexian mana. It's something you'll use multiple times, and it doesn't circumvent mana costs or color pie. We used it liberally in the file we handed over to Set Design. It did stay in the set but got knocked down to just seven cards, one mythic rare cycle, and two rare cards (one white and one blue). Adam agreed that there needed to be some in the set, as it's so iconically Phyrexian, but he wanted to limit how much to keep it from causing play design issue.</p>

<p><strong>Relentless</strong> – The third way Vision Design put Phyrexian mana in the set was on a mechanic we called relentless. It was a mechanic that went on instants and sorceries. It exiled the spell it was on upon resolution. Then on any turn in which you've played a land, you could cast it for its relentless cost from exile. (It would then be put into the graveyard.) All the monocolor mana in relentless costs was Phyrexian mana. Set Design was worried that there was too much going on in the set. Poison is a delicate ecosystem that requires a lot of work to balance, so relentless, and much of the Phyrexian mana in the set, was cut.</p>

<h3>Proliferate</h3>

<p>Proliferate was closely associated with the Phyrexians (premiering in <em>Scars of Mirrodin</em>), popular with the players, and not nearly as problematic to balance as Phyrexian mana. Vision Design's big tweak was to have the dominant counter in the set be oil counters rather than +1/+1 counters or -1/-1 counters. This would allow proliferate to shine and play differently than either <em>Scars of Mirrodin</em> block or <em>War of the Spark</em>.</p>

<p>Set Design kept oil counters and basically executed on proliferate how Vision Design proposed. It was put mostly in blue, black, and green, with just a tiny dollop on red. Vision Design had tried pushing it more in red, but the Council of Colors correctly noted that proliferate isn't really a red mechanic philosophically.</p>

<h2>Rogue ONE</h2>

<p>Here's how the ten two-color archetypes ended up:</p>

<p><strong>White-blue (artifacts)</strong> – The Phyrexians have always been tied to artifacts, so it only seemed right to have one draft archetype focus on them. Blue is primary in "artifact matters" and white is secondary, so those two colors seemed like the best choices.</p>

<p><strong>Blue-black (proliferate control)</strong> – Blue is one of oil counter colors. Black is one of the poison counter colors. Put the two of them together, and you have your normal manipulative blue-black deck, but now with a dose of counters and proliferate.</p>

<p><strong>Black-red (oil counters and sacrifice)</strong> – Sacrifice is a common black-red archetype. The set adds in oil counters to the mix and creates a two-color combination that feels quite Phyrexian, as they see death as a valuable tool.</p>

<p><strong>Red-green (midrange oil counters)</strong> – Red and green are both oil counter colors and are the two colors that care most about how many permanents you have with oil counters. This theme works well with a deck that grows in strength over time as you gain in mana and oil counters.</p>

<p><strong>Green-white (toxic aggro)</strong> – Green and white are two of the three poison colors. This deck makes a horde of creatures with toxic, including the Mite creature tokens, and swarms for a poison win.</p>

<p><strong>White-black (corrupted)</strong> – White and black are the two colors with the most corrupted cards, so they come together to poison your opponent just enough to make your cards even more powerful.</p>

<p><strong>Blue-red (oil counters and noncreature spells)</strong> – This deck uses your noncreature spells to gain more and more oil counters, which then create effects to help you win this tempo strategy.</p>

<p><strong>Black-green (poison victory)</strong> – Black and green are the two colors with the largest toxic creatures. Get them out and win in just a few hits.</p>

<p><strong>Red-white (For Mirrodin! Equipment)</strong> – Red and white are the two colors with the most Rebels in it. Use the Equipment with the For Mirrodin! keyword to aggressively attack.</p>

<p><strong>Green-blue (proliferate and poison)</strong> – Green has a lot of cards that poison. Blue and green are both good at proliferating. Poison your opponent and then slowly proliferate them to death. This is the most controlling of the poison decks.</p>

<h2>Two for ONE</h2>

<p><em>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</em> has more planeswalkers in it than any set, save <em>War of the Spark,</em> (five normal planeswalkers and five compleated planeswalkers), so it seemed apropos to have a card that grants extra loyalty abilities to planeswalkers, one of which is a mechanic from this set.</p>

<p>Tekuthal is part of the mythic rare Domini cycle that makes use of the Phyrexian mana I talked about above. It's also one of only a small handful of cards in the game's history that has the same mechanic twice.</p>

To help our readers and preview seekers, we've created this handy guide to preview season.</p>

<p>Tune in to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8ZGymAvfP97qJabgqUkz4A" target="_blank">the official <em>Magic: The Gathering </em>YouTube channel</a> or <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/magic" target="_blank">twitch.tv/magic</a> on January 17 beginning at 9 a.m. PT (12 p.m. ET) to get your first deep dive into the cards, mechanics, and big reveals of <em>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</em> ahead of the global release February 10!</p>

<iframe width="850" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/68km5c8JolA" title="New Set Debut | Phyrexia: All Will Be One" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>

<p>This page will help you follow along with everything coming by giving you the outlets where upcoming <em>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</em> previews are planned on each day. The goal is to help you find what you're looking for every day and avoid engaging in previews if you choose.</p>

<p>Below, you'll find a list of dates as well as any outlets previewing a card on that date. Once the previews are live, we'll update this article so that you can easily find them. If the link simply goes to the front of a website or social media site, that means they probably haven't previewed the card yet.</p>

<p>And if you just want to see all the cards that have been officially previewed in one place, you can always check out the <em>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</em> Card Image Gallery, Variant Card Image Gallery, and Commander Card Image Gallery. Note that these galleries are updated every morning, Monday through Friday, so they contain all cards previewed the previous day (and earlier), but not the day of (and we'll add links when these galleries go live on January 17).</p>

<p>For the most up-to-date listings, bookmark this page and check back regularly for all the latest previews from <em>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</em>!</p>

<p><em>I regret to write this, but I must face the truth. Daylight is losing its battle against an invading night.</em></p>

<p><em>This autumn in the provinces is crisper than usual, the harvest harsher. The night leaves a skin of frost on the pumpkin fields and on the last clinging leaves of the Kessig woods. No tentacled horrors have been seen since the closing of The Travails, and the Keening Mother slumbers peacefully behind the face of the moon. But I've heard farm folk whisper of a wrongness since that time, a misstep of the ticking hours, a bend in the shape of the darkness.</em></p>

<p><em>I fear not all was put right after The Travails. And on this world, there are always those who will take advantage of darkness. </em></p>

<p><em>Of course, I hear the howls in the night. At first, Kessigers called it a blessing from Sigarda that, since The Travails, those howls always died out, lonely plaints to an uncaring moon. But more and more, the wolf-sounds echo and multiply, full and strong and yearning, a chorus of savage throats.</em></p>

<p><em>In their way, the werewolves are celebrating. They celebrate their hot breaths in bracing air, the smell of flesh in their nostrils, the bending of their skeletons timed to the emergence of the moon. They celebrate that the night constricts the day to a few dwindling pale hours, and they celebrate the belief that the night will soon be theirs.</em></p>

<p><em>As I pen this, I hear my own pack whimpering in the woods behind me. I feel the urgent way they paw at the earth, how their heartbeats quicken as they look back into the darkened Ulvenwald. I know they feel the pull of the howl, for I feel it, too. We must seek a way to put things right, and soon.</em></p>

<p><em>Ever your friend,</em></p>

<p><em>Arlinn</em></p>

<p>Welcome back to Innistrad, a chilling plane of werewolves, vampires, and other things that go bump in the dark. Wanna read up on all the Innistrads and Outistrads of the plane? 
<!-- You can check out the Planeswalker's Guide from our first visit <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/savor-flavor/planeswalkers-guide-innistrad-2011-11-02">right here</a>. --></p>

<p>Let's start by recapping what happened most recently:</p>

<h1>PREVIOUSLY ON<nbsp> . . .</nbsp></h1>

<div class="figure-wrapper">

</div>

<p>The destructive feud between ancient planeswalkers Nahiri and Sorin began a hundred lifetimes ago. A bitter disagreement led to Sorin's ruthless decision to lock Nahiri in a magical prison, where she stayed for centuries. The feud came to a head two years ago when a freed Nahiri lured the Eldrazi titan Emrakul to Sorin's home plane of Innistrad to exact her vengeance.</p>

<p>Emrakul's presence unleashed a tide of madness, twisting the plane at every level. Villagers experienced delirious visions and strange body mutations. The angels, normally guardians of humanity, went mad and inflicted a horrific inquisition on the populace, led by the archangel Avacyn. Avacyn, once a stalwart symbol of hope and safety to the populace, was bitterly unmade by her creator, Sorin.</p>

<p>A group of heroic planeswalkers known as the Gatewatch came to Innistrad's aid. The necromancer Liliana summoned a massive army of zombies to help fight the wave of Eldrazi horrors, and the others joined forces to trap Emrakul in Innistrad's moon, which is made entirely of a magical substance known as Moonsilver.</p>

<h2>THE TRAVAILS</h2>

<p>This horrific series of events is now referred to by the populace as "The Travails." The term carries with it a sense of well-mannered euphemism. No one wants to relive the horror of that time, so in polite conversation, "The Travails" is the courteous thing to say.</p>

<h2>AVACYN AND SIGARDA</h2>

<div class="figure-wrapper">
<figure><img alt="pwg2" src="https://media.wizards.com/2021/images/daily/o7Hwyeydnw.jpg" />
<figcaption>Art by: <a href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&amp;output=spoiler&amp;method=visual&amp;artist=+[%22Howard%20Lyon%22]" target="_blank">Howard Lyon</a></figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>While Emrakul's madness has dissipated, it has been replaced by a new uneasiness. The humans of Innistrad once again face the night without their protector Avacyn. Now their thoughts turn to the past—old traditions, old protections, old fears.</p>

<p>Some denizens of Innistrad have begun to direct their prayers to the archangel Sigarda, the most powerful angel left in the wake of The Travails. Sigarda was one of the few angels who never succumbed to Emrakul's influence, and she fought nobly to defend humanity from Eldrazi monstrosities. She has taken up Avacyn's role as best she can, answering the fervent prayers of the lost and endangered. The people have given her many epithets: Sigarda the True, Sigarda the Shadow-Slayer, Sigarda the Hope of the Lost.</p>

<h2>AVACYN'S COLLAR, THE SYMBOL OF HER CHURCH</h2>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="pwg3" src="https://media.wizards.com/2021/images/daily/Hy23sdhdye.jpg" /></p>

<p>All throughout the provinces, villagers have taken it upon themselves to do rough, handcrafted repairs of the twisted symbols of Avacyn. The elongated shapes of the warped stones have been shattered, their stone harvested for the repairs. Today, cemetery headstones, church shrines, and roadside monuments all display restored symbols of Avacyn. Each was mended by rough stonework by hand: broken and cemented back together or lashed together with wire and twine. These are symbols of hope and self-reliance—even when no angel came forward to fix the world, the people have come forward to fix what they can.</p>

<h2>LUNAR DISRUPTION</h2>

<p>Once Emrakul was banished to the moon, the great sigil on its face formed by the imprisonment spell eventually faded from view. However, the Eldrazi still resides inside, slumbering quietly. Prominent astronomancers and the Dawnhart Coven of witches believe that the cosmic titan's residency in the moon might be related to Innistrad's newest problem.</p>

<p>Innistrad's day-night cycle is darkening. Sunlight is waning, the nights are getting longer and longer, and a chilly frost descends on the world. More night means more attacks by werewolves, vampires, and other horrifying creatures who have a vested interest in creating eternal night<nbsp> . . .</nbsp></p>

<h2>TOVOLAR'S HOWLPACK</h2>

<div class="figure-wrapper">
<figure><img alt="pwg4" src="https://media.wizards.com/2021/images/daily/k7dhyh83ds.jpg" />
<figcaption>Art by: <a href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&amp;output=spoiler&amp;method=visual&amp;artist=+[%22Chris%20Rahn%22]" target="_blank">Chris Rahn</a></figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>The werewolf leader Tovolar once led the Mondronen howlpack. His and other howlpacks disbanded, chased off and hunted down by angels when Avacyn was freed. Now, in the growing darkness since The Travails, Tovolar sees a chance to lead once again. Driven by a fierce pride in werewolf-kind, he seeks to unify all the howlpacks under his rule. He stands for the freedom to embrace the savage beast within, and many werewolves have left their human homes to join him. Once he has a powerful pack behind him, he'll stop the Dawnhart Coven and anyone else who wants to bring back the sun.</p>

<h2>DIRE-STRAIN WEREWOLVES</h2>

<div class="figure-wrapper">
<figure><img alt="pwg5" src="https://media.wizards.com/2021/images/daily/jw73ysdgwe.jpg" />
<figcaption>Art by: <a href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&amp;output=spoiler&amp;method=visual&amp;artist=+[%22Chris%20Rahn%22]" target="_blank">Chris Rahn</a></figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>The strong sway of the errant moon has produced a new breed of werewolf called the dire strain. In human form, these werewolves are markedly tall, lanky folk with a grim cast to their appearance. They distrust others, looking strangers up and down with their sunken, beady eyes, somehow both suspicious and bored. In werewolf form, they grow far larger than other werewolves, with legendary strength. They're capable of shredding stone with their claws and snapping bone with the slightest bite, and they're said to shrug off even blessed silver. The dire-strain werewolves are Tovolar's heavy hitters, the true powerhouses of his army.</p>

<h2>HEDGEWITCHES</h2>

<p>In the times before Avacyn, a smattering of covens and druidic cults conducted folk magics across the provinces. They practiced ancient hedge magics and nature rituals meant to improve crop yields, bring luck at weddings, and protect families from creatures of the night. Many of the practitioners of these traditions, called hedgewitches or simply witches, were hermits and outcasts, but their traditions permeated the towns and villages as well.</p>

<p>When Avacyn was created, villagers turned to her for protection, and reliance on hedge magic waned. Hedgewitch covens vanished or retreated into obscurity. Today, more residents of the provinces are turning back to traditions and ancient covens are meeting once again, especially in Kessig and Nephalia.</p>

<h2>THE DAWNHART COVEN</h2>

<div class="figure-wrapper">
<figure><img alt="pwg6" src="https://media.wizards.com/2021/images/daily/H72hstwegf.jpg" />
<figcaption>Art by: <a href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&amp;output=spoiler&amp;method=visual&amp;artist=+[%22Bryan%20Sola%22]" target="_blank">Bryan Sola</a></figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>One of the smaller covens of hedgewitches was known as the Dawnhart Coven, a cabal dedicated to nature and community. In the last two years, they have begun meeting again under their leader, Katilda, with most of their members being from small towns around the Natterknolls. They see signs of spirituality everywhere and are focused on reviving the ancient tradition of Harvesttide.</p>

<h2>THE HARVESTTIDE FESTIVAL</h2>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="pwg7" src="https://media.wizards.com/2021/images/daily/Jh27dhywe3.jpg" /></p>

<p>On a world where survival is never a guarantee, life is to be celebrated. Harvesttide was an ancient harvest festival, an annual celebration of life and community in the years before the Avacynian Church. Villagers commemorated the yearly Harvesttide with feasting, dancing, songs, chants, mask-wearing, bonfires, and wicker effigies. The Dawnhart Coven believes the festival is crucial to performing a ritual that would restore the balance of day and night on Innistrad.</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="pwg8" src="https://media.wizards.com/2021/images/daily/s723hsdywe.jpg" /></p>

<p>The Ulvenwald's trees glimmer with candles, lanterns, and magical spark-lights. Streamers and ribbons decorate the branches. Travelers along the paths toward Harvesttide can also see wicker "floats" with effigies of werewolves, zombies, vampires, and other fearsome creatures, to be triumphantly and defiantly burned during the festival.</p>

<h2>THE CELESTUS</h2>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="pwg9" src="https://media.wizards.com/2021/images/daily/SD23sfdfhy.jpg" /></p>

<p>Built by hedgewitches centuries ago, the Celestus is an astronomical mechanism in the heart of the Ulvenwald. Its purpose was to track the movements of stars and the moon. Katilda and the Dawnhart Coven believe she can use a spell to restore the day-night balance, but it's going to require activating the Celestus. To do that, a mechanism called the Sungold Lock in the center of the Celestus needs to be joined with an enchanted, blessed-silver item called the Moonsilver Key. Unfortunately, the Moonsilver Key has been lost for generations<nbsp> . . .</nbsp></p>

<p><em>Dearest brother,</em></p>

<p><em>While I have greatly enjoyed not hearing from you, I have decided that the value of rubbing my successes in your face far outweighs our blissful two-year silence. While your ghoulish girlfriend</em>,<em> Lillian Vest or whatever, may have dumped you, she left behind all her toys: that mass of zombies she raised to fight all those tentacle things. I don't know what happened, but she left them all wandering the streets of Thraben. The people were terrified, and they all left. It was hilarious!</em></p>

<p><em>Now I'm not one to look a gift corpse in the mouth, so I took the reins. Now I have a zombie army and a whole city to myself. I live in the fanciest room in the least-destroyed building, and I don't miss our games even a little bit. I even have a suitor to wage war against. His name is Wilbur, and I hate him, but a little attention is nice before I kill him (again).</em></p>

<p><em>Oh, what's that? You live with a crusty old man and have accomplished nothing of note in the past two years? That's so sad. I'm having this letter delivered by a ghoul whom I've commanded to do nothing but cry, just to demonstrate how sad I am for you.</em></p>

<p><em>Please write back soon,</em></p>

<p><em>Gisa</em></p>

Here is a breakdown of the updates and changes.</p>
<h2>Alchemy and Historic Card Rebalances</h2>
<p><strong>Goblin Trapfinder</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Changed: "This spell costs 2 less to cast" to "This spell costs 1 less to cast"</li>
</ul>
<p>Like Grinning Ignus and Racketeer Boss, Goblin Trapfinder was enabling combo decks using Ominous Traveler in Alchemy and Historic. Since perpetual mana cost reduction is more likely to enable problematic combos in the future, we are making the combo harder to assemble by rebalancing Goblin Trapfinder.</p>
<h3>Spirits</h3>
<p>Decks built around Brine Comber, Shipwreck Sifters, Patrician Geist, and other <em>Innistrad: Midnight Hunt</em> and <em>Innistrad: Crimson Vow</em> Spirit cards often don't have enough mana to support casting cards for their disturb costs. These changes aim to reduce the diminishing returns of playing multiple disturb cards and make decks built around cards like Brine Comber more competitive.</p>

<p><strong>Binding Geist // Spectral Binding</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cost 1U (from 2U)</li>
<li>Now 2/1 (from 3/1)</li>
<li>Cost for disturb U (from 1U)</li>
<li>Changed: "-2/-0 untl end of turn" to "-2/-0 until your next turn"</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Brine Comber // Brinebound Gift</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Now 2/2 (from 1/1)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Devoted Grafkeeper // Departed Soulkeeper</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Now 2/2 (from 2/1)</li>
<li>Changed: "When Devoted Grafkeeper enters the battlefield, mill two cards" to "When Devoted Grafkeeper enters the battlefield, mill four cards."</li>
<li><em>Departed Grafkeeper</em> – Removed: "Departed Grafkeeper can block only creatues with flying."</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Dorothea, Vengeful Victim // Dorothea's Retribution</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cost for disturb WU (from 1WU)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Dreamshackle Geist</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Now 3/2 (from 3/1)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Obsessive Collector</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Now 4/4 (from 4/3)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Gutter Skulker // Gutter Shortcut</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cost 2U (from 3U)</li>
<li>Cost for disturb 2U (from 3U)</li>
<li><em>Gutter Shortcut</em> – Add: "Enchanted creature gets +3/+0"</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Lantern Bearer // Lanterns' Lift</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cost for disturb 1U (from 2U)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mischievous Catgeist // Catlike Curiosity</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cost for disturb 1U (from 2U)</li>
<li>Catlike Curiosity – Add: "Enchanted creature gets +1/+1"</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Patrician Geist</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Changed: "Spells you cast from your graveyard cost 1 less to cast" to "Spells cast from your graveyard cost U less to cast"</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Phantom Carriage</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cost 2UU (from 4UU)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Shipwreck Sifters</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Changed: "Whenever you discard a Spirit card or a card with disturb<nbsp> . . .</nbsp>" to "Whenever a Spirit card or a card with disturb is put int your graveyard from anywhere<nbsp> . . .</nbsp>"</li>
</ul>
<h3>Samurai</h3>
<p>Decks built around <em>Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty</em>'s Samurai cards have a hard time keeping pace with other aggressive decks in Alchemy since the Samurai themselves have higher mana values. We are lowering the mana values of Samurai creature spells across the board to make Samurai-themed decks more competitive against other aggressive decks in Alchemy.</p>

<p><strong>Asari Captain</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cost 1RW (from 3RW</li>
<li>Now 2/1 (from 4/3)</li>
<li>Add: trample</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ancestral Katana</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cost for equip: 2 (from 3)</li>
<li>Changed: "Equipped creature gets +2/+1" to "Equipped creature gets +2/+2 and has 'This creature has first strike as long as it's attacking.'"</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Akki Ronin</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cost R (from 1R)</li>
<li>Now 1/2 (from 1/3)</li>
<li>Changed: "<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> you may discard a card" to "<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> you may put a card you're your hand on the bottom of your library."</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Eiganjo Exemplar</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cost W (from 1W)</li>
<li>Now 1/1 (from 2/1)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Imperial Blademaster</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Now 2/3 (from 2/2)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Imperial Subduer</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cost 1W (from 2W)</li>
<li>Now 3/1 (from 3/2)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Peerless Samurai</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cost 1R (from 2R)</li>
<li>Now 2/1 (from 2/3)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Raiyuu, Storm's Edge</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Now 4/4 (from 3/3)</li>

Get ready to ring in the Year of the Rabbit with <a href="https://locator.wizards.com/" target="_blank">WPN stores</a> in the Asia-Pacific region and the second annual APAC League.</p>

<p>Like last year, the promos and League events are exclusive to the Asia-Pacific region, and this year-long event is a great way to celebrate the Year of the Rabbit with the community. If you're a new or returning player, it's also a great chance to jump into the fray with epic games from each Standard set release in 2023.</p>

<h2>APAC League Overview</h2>

<p>The first of five seasons of the APAC League run from <strong>February 10–March 19</strong>. Here's how the event works:</p>

<ul>
	<li>WPN stores will host <strong>APAC League Events </strong>during the season period.</li>
	<li>Events will be <strong>Sealed</strong>,<strong> Booster Draft</strong>, or <strong>Standard </strong>format with the <strong>Swiss </strong>pairing method.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Year of the Rabbit Promos by Season</h2>

<p>Each season of the APAC League is accompanied by epic promos highlighting the Year of the Rabbit—a time of contemplation and rest, and of swift movement and travel, like the clever rabbit itself.</p>

<p>(Note: Year of the Rabbit promos will be available through WPN stores in Japan but will be distributed differently. Check with your local game store in Japan to learn more.)</p>

<p>There are 187 cards in The List for <em>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</em>. These are cards that work well with the flavor themes and mechanics of recent <em>Magic</em> sets. A card from <em>The List</em> can appear in Set Boosters 25% of the time, and with the appearance of a card from The List, about one in six times it will be a Universes Within version of a <em>Secret Lair X Street Fighter</em> card.</p>

<p><strong>Next B&amp;R Announcement:</strong> April 4, 2016</p>

<hr />
<h1>Explanation of Changes</h1>

<p>Wizards of the Coast examines tournament results from each competitive Constructed format. When a format becomes imbalanced, or too many games are not interactive, we examine the cause.</p>

<p>Here are our changes:</p>

<p><strong>Modern</strong></p>

<p>We look for competitively viable decks that frequently win before the fourth turn. The Amulet Bloom deck has reached a performance level that is consistent with those criteria. In the past year, Justin Cohen finished second at <a href="http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptfrf" target="_blank">Pro Tour <em>Fate Reforged</em></a> and Benjamin Miller made the Top 8 at <a href="http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/grand-prix-oklahoma-city-2015" target="_blank">Grand Prix Oklahoma City</a>. At the <a href="http://www.starcitygames.com/events/020116_cincinnati.html" target="_blank">StarCityGames.com Cincinnati Open</a>, with over 1,000 competitors, Bobby Fortanely won and Bill Comminos finished in the Top 8.</p>

<p>This deck frequently wins before the fourth turn. With an <auto-card>Amulet of Vigor</auto-card>, a <auto-card>Summer Bloom</auto-card>, a bounce land such as <auto-card>Simic Growth Chamber</auto-card>, and another land such as <auto-card>Gemstone Mine</auto-card>, the deck can generate seven mana for additional plays on turn two. <auto-card>Primeval Titan</auto-card>, or <auto-card>Hive Mind</auto-card> with a <auto-card>Summoner's Pact</auto-card>, can end the game very quickly. For these purposes, we are treating a turn-three <auto-card>Hive Mind</auto-card> with a Pact (which forces your opponent to pay 2GG next upkeep or lose the game) as a turn-three win.</p>

<p>We looked into which card could be banned to reduce the frequency of the very early wins. When the deck generates seven mana on turn two, there are a lot of cards that could lead to a quick finish. So we focused on the cards that lead to that explosive mana, and that led us to choose between <auto-card>Summer Bloom</auto-card> and <auto-card>Amulet of Vigor</auto-card>.</p>

<p>Since either card would be sufficient, the issue turned to what possibilities remained after either card was banned. Banning <auto-card>Amulet of Vigor</auto-card> leaves a <auto-card>Summer Bloom</auto-card> ramp deck. Banning <auto-card>Summer Bloom</auto-card> allows <auto-card>Amulet of Vigor</auto-card> with tapped lands. While it was not clear that either of these has all the tools to form a competitive deck today, the deck with <auto-card>Amulet of Vigor</auto-card> is more distinctive and has more potential as more tapped lands are printed. <auto-card>Azusa, Lost but Seeking</auto-card> is a potential replacement for <auto-card>Summer Bloom</auto-card>, but it is less efficient—so while there is a deck to play, it won't have frequent turn-three wins.</p>

<p>For those reasons, <auto-card>Summer Bloom</auto-card> is banned from Modern.</p>

<p>We also look for decks that hold a large enough percentage of the competitive field to reduce the diversity of the format.</p>

<p>Antonio Del Moral León won <a href="http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptfrf" target="_blank">Pro Tour <em>Fate Reforged</em></a> playing <auto-card>Splinter Twin</auto-card>, and Jelger Wiegersma finished third; <auto-card>Splinter Twin</auto-card> has won two of the four Modern Pro Tours. <auto-card>Splinter Twin</auto-card> reached the Top 8 of the last six Modern Grand Prix. The last <a href="http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/fact-sheet-grand-prix-pittsburgh-2015" target="_blank">Modern Grand Prix in Pittsburgh</a> had three <auto-card>Splinter Twin</auto-card> decks in the Top 8, including Alex Bianchi's winning deck.</p>

<p>Decks that are this strong can hurt diversity by pushing the decks that it defeats out of competition. They can also reduce diversity by supplanting similar decks. For instance, Shaun McLaren won <a href="http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptbng14" target="_blank">Pro Tour <em>Born of the Gods</em></a> playing <a href="http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/event-coverage/top-8-decks-2014-02-22" target="_blank">this</a> Jeskai control deck. Alex Bianchi won our most recent Modern Grand Prix playing <a href="http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gppit15/top-8-decklists-2015-11-22" target="_blank">a similar deck</a> but adding the <auto-card>Splinter Twin</auto-card> combination. Similarly, Temur Tempo used to see play at high-level events but has been supplanted by Temur Twin.</p>

<p>We considered what one would do with the cards from a <auto-card>Splinter Twin</auto-card> deck with <auto-card>Splinter Twin</auto-card> banned. In the case of some Jeskai or Temur, there are very similar decks to build. In other cases, there is Kiki-Jiki as a replacement.</p>

<p>In the interest of competitive diversity, <auto-card>Splinter Twin</auto-card> is banned from Modern.</p>

<h1>Pauper</h1>

<p>The format currently has poor color balance. Of the ten most played nonland cards, nine are blue; the tenth is <auto-card>Lightning Bolt</auto-card>. We looked into the cause of this.</p>

<p>The Esper Familiars deck uses <auto-card>Sunscape Familiar</auto-card> and <auto-card>Nightscape Familiar</auto-card> to reduce the cost of blue spells, which include "free spells" such as <auto-card>Cloud of Faeries</auto-card> and <auto-card>Snap</auto-card>. Combined with the bounce lands, this means the "free spells" effectively produce mana. Here is a typical winning position: One casts <auto-card>Ghostly Flicker</auto-card> targeting <auto-card>Cloud of Faeries</auto-card> and a <auto-card>Mnemonic Wall</auto-card>, netting mana and getting back the <auto-card>Ghostly Flicker</auto-card>. Once enough mana is produced, the <auto-card>Ghostly Flicker</auto-card> can target a <auto-card>Sea Gate Oracle</auto-card> instead of the <auto-card>Cloud of Faeries</auto-card>, repeatedly looking for <auto-card>Sage's Row Denizen</auto-card>. From there, the flickering mills the opponent's deck.</p>

<p>Because of all the card-drawers here, it is difficult for non-blue decks to defeat this deck. It pushes the metagame to the imbalanced state where blue is heavily overplayed. <auto-card>Cloud of Faeries</auto-card> is likely the most problematic card in the deck.</p>

<p>In the interest of color diversity, <auto-card>Cloud of Faeries</auto-card> is banned from Pauper.</p>

<p><strong>Pauper</strong>:</p>

<p><auto-card>Chatterstorm</auto-card> is banned.</p>

<p><auto-card>Sojourner's Companion</auto-card> is banned.</p>

<p><strong><em>Magic Online</em> effective date</strong>: September 8, 2021</p>

<hr />
<p><em>Modern Horizons 2</em> introduced many new high-impact cards to Pauper, and we've been watching the metagame absorb and adapt to those additions over the last several weeks. In that time, Storm and Affinity decks have risen to occupy a large share of the metagame. We've heard community feedback that metagame pressures from Storm and Affinity have pushed out a variety of other deck options that were previously viable.</p>

<p>In recent weeks, Storm combo decks had the highest non-mirror match win rate among top decks and earned by far the most 5–0 performances in <em>Magic Online</em> leagues. These decks use fast mana to power out a large <auto-card>Chatterstorm</auto-card>, often in combination with <auto-card>First Day of Class</auto-card>, to create an insurmountable board state or even win the game on the spot. Given the limitations of the Pauper card pool, many decks struggle to interact with this win condition. Therefore, to address Storm's high win rate, high metagame share, and difficulty to interact with, we are banning <auto-card>Chatterstorm</auto-card>.</p>

<p>We considered banning <auto-card>Galvanic Relay</auto-card> as well, but our hope is to allow players to experiment with slower, lower-powered versions of the deck. Additionally, we've seen the card being used in other contexts where it's more about generating value than winning the game on the spot.</p>

<p>Affinity has been a slightly different case, in that from a pure win-rate perspective, the metagame seemed to adapt successfully, with the most popular Grixis Affinity variants settling in at just under 50% non-mirror match win rate. That said, while Affinity was being kept in check by a small number of top decks, its win rate against many of the less represented decks was high. To open the metagame to more diversity, we're choosing to ban <auto-card>Sojourner's Companion</auto-card>. We considered other options, such as <auto-card>Atog</auto-card> or <auto-card>Disciple of the Vault</auto-card>, but opted to preserve the unique gameplay style of the deck. Banning <auto-card>Sojourner's Companion</auto-card> should lower the consistency and win rate of the deck without fundamentally changing the way it plays.</p>

<p>We're aware that some players have voiced other potential metagame concerns that could result from Storm and Affinity being weakened. But due to the unique nature of the Pauper card pool and the complexity of the metagame, we've chosen to start with these two changes and observe in practice if further changes are needed rather than try to predict and preempt cascading metagame changes.</p>

<p>These Pauper changes will be live later today on <em>Magic Online</em>.</p>

<p>Around 15 years ago, I remember starting to play the format on <em>Magic Online</em>, back when it was just a player-run format. I immediately fell in love with the constraints and unique cards that could see play here and nowhere else.</p>

<p>The format has come a long way since then! For one, I can no longer cast <auto-card>Empty the Warrens</auto-card> (which is for the better). It's also grown a lot thanks to events on <em>Magic Online</em> and massive support from the community.</p>

<p>Today, I want to announce something big for Pauper, a change that helps the format's health and ties right into the community. In fact, if you want to watch it (which I do recommend you do, as you'll get even more than you do in this article), it's today's episode of Good Morning <em>Magic</em>:</p>

<p><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0AZyncays2w" width="560"></iframe></p>

<p>But this was a big enough deal that I wanted to make sure there was a text version, too. So, dear reader, here we are! Let me give you the rundown.</p>

<h1>Unique Challenges</h1>

<p>Whenever a new set comes out, I always enjoy watching people pore over the commons to see which ones might have a shot at Pauper.</p>

<p>With ancillary sets, like <em>Commander Legends</em> and <em>Modern Horizons 2</em>, consistently released in addition to our Standard sets, it increases the number of cards each year that enter the Pauper format. And while it's exciting to get sets like those, which have commons of a different power level than usual, it also increases the chance that they're going to see play in Pauper. And sometimes<nbsp> . . .</nbsp> in big ways. We've seen this play out right in front of us with cards like <auto-card>Fall from Favor</auto-card> and <auto-card>Chatterstorm</auto-card> completely defining the format. Both of <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/january-14-2021-banned-and-restricted-announcement" target="_blank">those</a> <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/september-8-2021-banned-and-restricted-announcement" target="_blank">cards</a> ended up being banned.</p>

<p>While their impact on the format was definitely felt, both of them took a while to get banned.</p>

<p>Why is that? Why did it take so long?</p>

<p>I want to be transparent with you here about the challenges. To properly decide to ban a card, it takes a lot of discussion, format knowledge, and analysis. And Pauper, while a format that is very much enjoyed by tons of players, is still a format that is substantially smaller in terms of player population than other formats like Standard and Modern—and those take a lot of attention. Additionally, while our competitive Play Design team knows the primary competitive formats extremely well, Pauper is not an area of strong expertise for most people at Wizards.</p>

<p>So, we've found ourselves in a position where the people who normally work on banning cards don't have the bandwidth nor the format expertise to craft the format in the way many Pauper players would appreciate. This is entirely reasonable—I wouldn't ask our play designers to reprioritize Pauper over Standard and Modern playtesting and design decisions—but also caused trouble in the Pauper format because of the long lag times.</p>

<p>We've been stuck in kind of a tough spot, which hasn't made anyone very happy.</p>

<p>Unique challenges sometimes need unique solutions, and so Aaron Forsythe and I spearheaded an idea that has finally come to fruition.</p>

<p>Today, I'm excited to announce the Pauper Format Panel, or PFP for short.</p>

<h1>Introducing: The Pauper Format Panel</h1>

<p>Pauper has always had an incredible community. The PFP takes that and puts those expert community members as a driving force behind the format.</p>

<p>The Pauper Format Panel consists of seven people, including myself and six notable Pauper community members from around the world. We're going to be discussing the format and providing recommendations of action to the Play Design team at Wizards. This will cause action such as bannings to take place <em>much </em>quicker, eliminating the challenges that slowed us down previously.</p>

<p>Now, you might hear this and immediately think of two other similar bodies for a different format: the Commander Rules Committee, who makes all ban and format decisions for Commander, and the Commander Advisory Group, who helps inform and discuss matters with the Rules Committee.</p>

<p>That's a natural comparison to draw. However, this is not quite like of those groups. It sits somewhere between them. If the Commander Rules Committee is a 10 on the scale of "final decision making," in that they are the arbiters of all decisions, I'd say the Pauper Format Panel will be about an 8.</p>

<p>What the PFP will be doing is working together to come up with our recommendations for any banned cards. Then I, as the Wizards member, will take this to our internal teams at Wizards for further discussion.</p>

<p>Most of the time, I predict that the PFP decisions will be taken wholesale and put into action. Occasionally, there may be additional questions asked by our Play Design group that we should dig into, but often Play Design will trust the expertise of the PFP.</p>

<p>Now, who are the people in this group?</p>

<p>Pauper is a format played across the world, both online and in Paper. It was important to me to find people to represent this. So, in addition to myself, the team is:</p>

<p><strong>Mirco Ciavatta (Italy)</strong> – If you've spent any time playing Pauper on <em>Magic Online</em>, there's a decent chance you've come up against the formidable Heisen01 at some point. He also takes his online skills into the real-life arena, where he has won the Italian Paupergeddon tournament series twice! A Streamer and YouTuber focused on Pauper, he uploads new Pauper content every few days <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1jO4Ge4jmlvaImhze5ldaw" target="_blank">on his YouTube channel</a>. Follow him on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/Heisen011" target="_blank">@Heisen01</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Emma Partlow (UK) </strong>– A <em>Magic</em> strategist and writer for TCGplayer, she's also half of <a href="https://thebmcast.fireside.fm/" target="_blank">the BMCast</a>, a podcast about a variety of Constructed formats that has featured Pauper plenty. She loves playing Pauper, and you don't want to get between her and her <auto-card>Slippery Bogle</auto-card>s! Find her on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/emmmzyne" target="_blank">@emmmzyne</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Ryuji Saito (Japan)</strong> – One of the three people behind the Japanese Pauper website <a href="https://paupermtg.com/" target="_blank">PauperMTG.com</a>, Ryuji is a student of the format and explores both the competitive and more offbeat parts of the format. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGMm98fybxWjUCNXQ247BZw" target="_blank">The content he helps create</a> is worth watching even if you don't speak Japanese! Follow him on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/saito_o3" target="_blank">@saito_o3</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Paige Smith (USA)</strong> – A stalwart of the <em>Magic Online</em> trenches and notorious for her skill with Elves, Paige has written tons on Pauper and contributed to the format a great deal. She currently writes for <a href="https://www.coolstuffinc.com/" target="_blank">CoolStuffInc</a>, and you can find her on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/TheMaverickGal" target="_blank">@TheMaverickGal</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Alex Ullman (USA)</strong> – Alex has been a staple of the Pauper community for as long as I can remember. Between his in-depth Pauper analysis <a href="https://nerdtothecore.com/" target="_blank">on his blog</a>, countless articles, Discord presence, and more, he has become one of the most well-known Pauper players. Find him on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/nerdtothecore" target="_blank">@NerdtotheCore</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Alexandre Weber (Brazil)</strong> – On top of being an excellent player (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3cufsl-_Br8M0nGU5Y7kFw" target="_blank">check out gameplay on his YouTube channel</a>!), Alexandre is also in touch with the Brazilian community, even running Pauper events as a tournament organizer. Go follow him on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/webermtg" target="_blank">@Webermtg</a>.</p>

<p>But don't just take it from me—you can go watch my video above where each member introduces themselves. Go check it out!</p>

<p>I'm very excited to welcome all six of these people into the PFP. And of course, as time goes on, there may be additional members added or some members may leave.</p>

<h1>Upcoming Plans</h1>

<p>Now that the PFP has been formed, we've just started discussing possible changes to the current Pauper format as of last week. We know many players have been asking for changes, and while we don't have anything to announce at this time, you can expect to hear more soon. We're unlikely to announce any changes while <em>Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty</em> previews are happening, so if there are changes to be made, I would expect them either before previews begin or after previews end.</p>

<p>In the meantime, if you have any suggestions for the format, what we should ban, feedback on the PFP, or anything else, feel free to contact us. Everyone's Twitter handle is above, and you can find me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/GavinVerhey" target="_blank">@GavinVerhey</a><nbsp> . . .</nbsp> as well as on my Tumblr, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, or even by sending an email to <a href="mailto:BeyondBasicsMagic@gmail.com">BeyondBasicsMagic@gmail.com</a>. I'd love to hear any thoughts you have.</p>

<p>This is a brand-new experiment, and I'm really excited to dig into the format with the rest of the group. I look forward to shaping a thriving Pauper format, one that people can fall in love with just as I did so many years ago.</p>

<p>Talk with you more soon,</p>

<p><em>Historic and Brawl sections by Jay Parker</em></p>

<h1>Standard</h1>

<p>In the last banned and restricted list update, we chose not to make any changes to Standard. At that time, the environment had just seen the results of Players Tours 3 and 4, the companion rules change was recent, and <em>Core Set 2021</em> had just entered the format. While we saw new decks emerging, ultimately the top decks were able to adapt and retain their metagame share. After watching the environment progress for several weeks and reviewing the decklist entries for the Players Tour Finals, we've decided to make some changes to shake up the metagame.</p>

<p>This set of changes is a deviation from our usual banned-list philosophy for Standard, and as such, we consider it an experiment. Outside of the very top levels of competitive play, including throughout most of the <em>MTG Arena</em> traditional Standard ladder, we're seeing a good distribution of deck diversity and win rates. However, at the skill level of our most competitive tournaments and the Mythic ranking on the <em>Arena</em> ladder, we do see a small number of decks with high win rates and play rates that have remained in that metagame position for quite some time.</p>

<p>Under our usual approach, we would have allowed Standard rotation to provide a natural and predictable shift in the metagame with the release of <em>Zendikar Rising</em>. But in an era of social distancing, the proportion of Standard play occurring on digital platforms has increased substantially. As the rate at which players can rack up games of Standard in digital is higher than in tabletop, we believe it's correct to enact metagame change at a faster rate as well.</p>

<p>Therefore, we're making bans targeted at weakening decks that have been strong and popular at the highest levels of competitive play and at some cards and combos that have overstayed their welcome in the eyes of much of the Standard community.</p>

<p>Ramp decks using <auto-card>Growth Spiral</auto-card> together made up 68% of the day 1 metagame at the Players Tour Finals and represent approximately 25–30% of the metagame at Mythic ranking on the <em>Arena</em> ladder. Within that category, <auto-card>Wilderness Reclamation</auto-card> decks have been considered the strongest archetype by much of the competitive community, making up 54% of the metagame at the Players Tour Finals and about 15% of the Mythic metagame on <em>Arena</em>. In order to remove Reclamation decks from this most played spot and to reduce the metagame share of ramp decks in general, <auto-card>Wilderness Reclamation</auto-card> and <auto-card>Growth Spiral</auto-card> are banned.</p>

<p>Another archetype that has maintained a high win rate over a long period of time is Black-Red (or Jund) Sacrifice, featuring the <auto-card>Cauldron Familiar</auto-card> and <auto-card>Witch's Oven</auto-card> combo. In addition to having high overall win rates, these decks put considerable pressure on aggressive and midrange creature decks. Further, the number of triggers generated by these decks can be cumbersome for both players in digital play. To weaken these sacrifice strategies, open up more metagame diversity, and create a more fun gameplay environment, <auto-card>Cauldron Familiar</auto-card> is banned.</p>

<p>Finally, we'll also be removing <auto-card>Teferi, Time Raveler</auto-card> from the environment. We've often heard the feedback that the repetitive play patterns and reduced capability for interaction that <auto-card>Teferi, Time Raveler</auto-card> can create feel oppressive and limiting. While we'd considered banning <auto-card>Teferi, Time Raveler</auto-card> in past updates, one reason we didn't was evidence that it was helping hold <auto-card>Wilderness Reclamation</auto-card> decks in check. With <auto-card>Wilderness Reclamation</auto-card> leaving the environment, we feel it's also time for the Standard metagame to move on without <auto-card>Teferi, Time Raveler</auto-card>.</p>

<p>We note that <auto-card>Growth Spiral</auto-card>, <auto-card>Wilderness Reclamation</auto-card>, and <auto-card>Teferi, Time Raveler</auto-card> were already slated to rotate this fall with the release of <em>Zendikar Rising</em>. With that in mind, we view this set of changes as an early rotation for those cards to help freshen up the remaining summer metagame. In the case of <auto-card>Cauldron Familiar</auto-card>, we're taking the opportunity not only to improve the metagame short term but also remove a balance risk and undesirable play pattern leading into next year.</p>

<p>We emphasize that these changes are, to a large degree, a product of the times and the current focus on digital play. We look forward to hearing community feedback on this approach and will continue to keep an eye on the metagame going forward.</p>

<h1>Pioneer</h1>

<p>With the last banned and restricted list update, we chose to unban <auto-card>Oath of Nissa</auto-card> in Pioneer. This wasn't intended to be a major update to the format or an alternative to other changes, but rather what we viewed as a relatively safe unban in the context of a metagame that was looking healthy by many metrics. Much community discussion followed that update, prompting us to take a further look at the need for change in Pioneer.</p>

<p>Although we continue to see many different decks have success in Pioneer, and no decks with problematic win rates against the field, we do see that combo decks as a group make up a large portion of the competitive metagame. We've heard feedback that the frequency at which one finds themselves facing an opposing combo deck restricts deck-building options and can make play experiences unenjoyable. While win rate data may not point to change being needed, a different, more important set of data does: player participation.</p>

<p>While the reduction in tabletop tournaments due to the need for social distancing shortly after Pioneer's launch earlier this year is certainly a factor, we've also seen a decline in Pioneer play rates on <em>Magic Online</em> throughout the course of the year. It's clear that many players who have been, or could be, interested in Pioneer are ready for a change. Ultimately, how much fun players are having with the environment is the most important driving force behind B&amp;R updates, and so we're choosing to ban four cards to shake things up and push the competitive metagame away from combo decks.</p>

<p>These bans are primarily aimed at disrupting <auto-card>Inverter of Truth</auto-card> decks; <auto-card>Underworld Breach</auto-card> decks; the <auto-card>Heliod, Sun-Crowned</auto-card> plus <auto-card>Walking Ballista</auto-card> combo; and <auto-card>Kethis, the Hidden Hand</auto-card> combo decks. While Kethis combo decks are a relatively new reemergence in the metagame, we're seeing signs that these decks are already problematic and would become more so if other top decks were weakened. Kethis decks are currently among the top 5–0 trophy winners in <em>Magic Online</em> Pioneer leagues, despite being a modest portion of the field.</p>

<p>Therefore, we're choosing to ban <auto-card>Inverter of Truth</auto-card>, <auto-card>Underworld Breach</auto-card>, <auto-card>Walking Ballista</auto-card>, and <auto-card>Kethis, the Hidden Hand</auto-card> in Pioneer. Our intent is to dramatically reduce instances where players risk losing to a combo kill when tapping out in the early- to mid-game. This should open up the field for more traditional midrange and control decks and put less pressure on aggressive decks to also focus on hand disruption and counterspells.</p>

<p>We did consider several other cards as alternative bans aimed at these same decks. <auto-card>Thassa's Oracle</auto-card> was one that we discussed as a lighter touch for weakening Inverter and Breach decks. However, Inverter decks are still capable of winning with <auto-card>Jace, Wielder of Mysteries</auto-card> alone, and it isn't clear that a <auto-card>Thassa's Oracle</auto-card> ban would be enough to push Inverter decks out of the competitive metagame. Next, even though <auto-card>Thassa's Oracle</auto-card> has often been a win condition of choice for <auto-card>Underworld Breach</auto-card> decks, once the deck's core combo engine is running, it can win in many ways. Some recent versions of the <auto-card>Underworld Breach</auto-card> deck even forgo <auto-card>Thassa's Oracle</auto-card> entirely. The cards we've chosen are the set that gives us the most confidence in creating a significant shift in the metagame.</p>

<p>We understand that this represents a large change to the Pioneer environment, and, frankly, that's the intent. While we're past the phase of frequent weekly updates to Pioneer, we're still in a period where changes are necessary to help shape the format in its initial launch year. We want to ensure that Pioneer can deliver an enjoyable play experience to players who are looking for an accessible, nonrotating format that's closer to Standard in power level and offers a variety of archetypes and decks to choose from. We're dedicated to actively supporting Pioneer and will continue to incorporate both data and community feedback.</p>

<h1>Historic</h1>

<p>The Historic metagame is moving quickly right now; the addition of new cards through <em>Jumpstart</em> is having a large impact, as will <em>Amonkhet Remastered</em> when it arrives soon. There are many of these new decks we are watching closely, but our strong preference in times like this is to give the meta time to develop naturally. We want to see which of these new decks turn out to show enduring strength versus merely making an initial splash. That said, there are two places where we feel we have enough information that we should take action: <auto-card>Wilderness Reclamation</auto-card> and <auto-card>Teferi, Time Raveler</auto-card>.</p>

<p>We touched on <auto-card>Wilderness Reclamation</auto-card> in our last banned and restricted list update, saying that, while it was powerful, we were only seeing it in problematic decks alongside <auto-card>Nexus of Fate</auto-card>. Since then, we've seen a Temur Reclamation list grow steadily in Historic that leverages both <auto-card>Expansion // Explosion</auto-card> and <auto-card>Field of the Dead</auto-card>. We are seeing this deck put up significant numbers, representing over 10% of Best-of-Three games while maintaining concerning win rates. This is a card and deck configuration that we have spent a good bit of time discussing, analyzing, and watching, so we feel that it is one where we have enough information to act. In order to encourage increased metagame health and variety, <auto-card>Wilderness Reclamation</auto-card> is suspended in Historic.</p>

<p>For Teferi, Timer Raveler, we get much the same feedback in Historic that we get in Standard. In Historic, we also find that the power of the reduced capability for interaction that <auto-card>Teferi, Time Raveler</auto-card> brings scales with the power of the interaction he's preventing and the board he's consequently protecting. He is also seen very frequently in Historic, appearing in over 20% of Historic Best-of-Three games and significant percentages in other modes as well. For these reasons, we are suspending <auto-card>Teferi, Time Raveler</auto-card> in Historic. As with all suspensions, we will be closely monitoring the impact this has on the format.</p>

<h1>Brawl</h1>

<p><auto-card>Teferi, Time Raveler</auto-card> is one of the most played commanders in Brawl, appearing in over 10% of games, and he has one of the highest win rates. In addition, we see a similar impact in Brawl to that described in the other formats. For these reasons, <auto-card>Teferi, Time Raveler</auto-card> is banned in Brawl.</p>

<h1>On Announcement Timing and Effective Date</h1>

<p>In the past, we've given a one-week advanced notice for updates to the banned and restricted list. Because of the increased focus on digital play environments during this time period, we're choosing to forgo that advanced notice and roll out these changes as soon as possible. This isn't necessarily indicative of how we'll announce and implement in the future, and we're continuing to look at how we balance giving players advance notice versus staying agile with respect to changing metagames.</p>

For Wizards of the Coast, this means that we've seen a large spike in the overall costs to produce <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>. As such, we will be increasing prices by around 11%, allowing for regional variation, on select products in our lineup starting in September.</p>

<p>We've worked hard to keep Draft Boosters—and later Set Boosters and Collector Boosters—at a relatively consistent price across our premier sets—the four major yearly releases that affect the Standard format—for as long as we were able. However, the price to produce <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> has increased significantly, and we've especially seen an uptick in the costs to produce, manufacture, and ship <em>Magic</em> around the world in the past year. We've kept the scope of the price increase as narrow as possible, and will only be adjusting the prices on the following premier set, <em>Unfinity</em>, and <em>Jumpstart</em> products:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Draft Boosters</li>
	<li>Set Boosters</li>
	<li>Collector Boosters</li>
	<li>Bundles</li>
	<li><em>Jumpstart</em> Boosters</li>
</ul>

<p>Commander decks, meanwhile, have a price increase going into effect with <em>Streets of New Capenna</em>. There are no plans to increase the price of Commander decks further in July.</p>

<p>Each of these products will increase by slightly different percentages, which we estimate will be approximately 11% across the products that are seeing an increase, allowing for regional variation. These increases also will not affect other product lines, like <em>Masters</em>, <em>Modern Horizons</em>, <em>Secret Lair</em>, Challenger Decks, or Universes Beyond.</p>

<p>Additionally, even for premier sets, we do not currently have plans to change prices on Prerelease Packs.</p>

<p>The price increase will affect <em>Dominaria United</em> as well as any backlist products starting in July.</p>

There is a robust collection of 47 full-art tokens, two emblems, and one double-sided dungeon with The Initiative helper card on the back across <em>Commander Legends: Battle for Baldur's Gate</em> and its Commander decks.</p>

<p>In <em>Commander Legends: Battle for Baldur's Gate</em> Draft and Set Boosters, there are 19 full-art tokens and one double-sided dungeon with The Initiative helper card on the back. Tokens found in Collector Boosters can include one of 18 full-art tokens as traditional foil double-sided tokens, each with a Treasure token on the back, or the double-sided Undercity dungeon card (also in traditional foil).</p>

<p>Three of the four <em>Commander Legends: Battle for Baldur's Gate</em> Commander decks include nine double-sided tokens and the double-sided dungeon card with The Initiative on the back. The Blue-Red Draconic Dissent Commander deck features the same double-sided dungeon card, seven double-sided tokens, and two double-sided emblems with Copy tokens on the back side.</p>

<h3>What Does That Mean?</h3>

<p>First of all, be aware that if you are listed as having two or three types (such as Johnny / Spike), your most prominent type is listed first.</p>

<p>Now that you’ve taken the test, I’m sure you’re asking questions like what the heck is a Timmy, Johnny, or Spike? Here in <strong>Magic</strong><b> </b>R&amp;D our job is create a game that makes players happy. In order to do this, we have to find out what players like about our game. Doing so has been a long ongoing process involving numerous factors. We’ve done questionnaires. We’ve done focus groups. We’ve lurked on <b>Magic </b>web sites and bulletin boards. We’ve talked to players in person. Heck, we even see what articles you read on this site.</p>

<p>After numerous years, we’ve come to the conclusion that there are three basic types of <b>Magic </b>players. The fancy term for these categories is "psychographic profiles." A psychographic profile separates players into categories based on their psychological make-up. What motivates that player to play? What kind of cards do they like? What kind of things encourages that player to keep on playing?</p>

<p>Because R&amp;D loves naming things, we have given each of these three category types a name: Timmy, Johnny, and Spike. In this column I am going to explain each type and talk about how we came up with the goofy nickname.</p>

<p>One last thing before I start. Very few players fall into one specific psychographic profile. Most players have elements that overlap numerous profiles. This is why, for example, some of you who took the test got a combination of profiles rather than just one. I will talk about the hybrids after I explain each profile.</p>
<docimage id="1">
<h3>Timmy</h3>

<p>Timmy wasn't the first profile we created, but it was the first profile we named. Timmy’s naming happened by accident during <i>Tempest </i>design. We were talking about whether or not <autocard>Verdant Force</autocard> would be popular. I happen to have a flair for the dramatic (if you haven’t caught on yet), so I started one of my little speeches: (Incidentally, I’m not 100% sure why I chose the name "Timmy." I wanted to personify the kid so I gave him a name and Timmy had this innocent little-kid quality to it that must have struck my fancy in the heat of the moment.)</p>

<p>“Imagine a kid goes into a game store. Let’s just call him… 'Timmy.' Now, Timmy doesn’t have a lot of money. So, he buys one pack of Bogavhati (<i>Tempest</i>’s codename). He rips it open and starts tearing through the cards to find the rare. And then he sees it. It’s a big green creature. Seven power. Seven toughness. It’s huge. Huge! He’s eyes keep moving. He glances up at the casting cost: 5GGG, blah, blah, blah. Boring. Move on. Timmy looks at the rules text. There’s a bunch of words. Timmy reads. Every turn Timmy gets another creature. Another entire creature. It’s small, but in ten turns, he’ll have twenty creatures. A 7/7 creature with twenty 1/1s. How does his opponent stop that? It can’t be stopped! Timmy finally exhales. He has found the Holy Grail.”</p>

<p>For some reason, the name Timmy stuck.</p>

<p>Timmy is what we in R&amp;D call the "power gamer." Timmy likes to win big. He doesn’t want to eke out a last minute victory. Timmy wants to smash his opponents. He likes his cards to be impressive, and he enjoys playing big creatures and big spells.</p>

<p>One of the misconceptions is that Timmy has to be young. While its true that younger players are more apt to fall into this category, players of any age can be a Timmy. What sets Timmy apart from the other two profiles is that Timmy is motivated by fun. He plays <b>Magic </b>because it’s enjoyable. Timmy is very social. An important part of the game is sitting around with his friends.</p>

<p>Timmy cares more about the quality of his win than the quantity of his wins. For example, Timmy sits down and plays ten games. He only wins three games out of ten but the three he wins, he dominates his opponent. Timmy had fun. Timmy walks away happy.</p>

<p>Each set, R&amp;D makes sure to design a certain number of cards for Timmy. Timmy cards, as we call them, tend to be big creatures or spells with big effects. In general, Timmy cards are exciting but not too economical. The more efficiently costed ones will catch Spike’s eye. Good examples of Timmy cards are: <autocard>Krosan Beast</autocard>, <autocard>Iridescent Angel</autocard>, and just about any dragon.</p>
<docimage id="2">
<h3>Johnny</h3>

<p>Johnny was the second profile to get a name. During <i>Urza’s Saga</i> development, R&amp;D had accepted the Timmy and "tournament player" profiles, but I believed that there was an important profile missing. You see, I wasn’t really a Timmy player and I wasn’t really a tournament player. I was this missing third type. While trying to explain who he was, I stumbled into calling him "Johnny." Like Timmy, the name stuck.</p>

<p>Johnny is the creative gamer to whom <b>Magic </b>is a form of self-expression. Johnny likes to win, but he wants to win with style. It’s very important to Johnny that he win on his own terms. As such, it’s important to Johnny that he’s using his own deck. Playing <b>Magic</b> is an opportunity for Johnny to show off his creativity.</p>

<p>Johnny likes a challenge. Johnny enjoys winning with cards that no one else wants to use. He likes making decks that win in innovative ways. What sets Johnny apart from the other profiles is that Johnny enjoys deckbuilding as much as (or more than) he enjoys playing. Johnny loves the cool interactions of the cards. He loves combo decks. Johnny is happiest when he’s exploring uncharted territory.</p>

<p>Like Timmy, Johnny cares more about the quality of his wins than the quantity. For example, let's say Johnny builds a new deck that has a neat but difficult way to win. He plays ten games and manages to get his deck to do its thing… once. Johnny walks away happy.</p>

<p>Each set, R&amp;D designs some cards for Johnny. Johnny cards are cards that have unique effects that Johnny can build cool decks around. In general, Johnny cards are the kind of cards with real potential. (Some of them will eventually excite Spike.) Good examples of Johnny cards are <autocard>Holistic Wisdom</autocard>, <autocard>Radiate</autocard>, and <autocard>Battle of Wits</autocard>.</p>
<docimage id="3">
<h3>Spike</h3>

<p>Although Spike was the first profile R&amp;D was aware of, it was the last to get a name. In fact, "Spike" is the only nickname I didn’t come up with. None of R&amp;D did. You see for years, R&amp;D just called them Timmy, Johnny, and "the tournament player." But at some point we explained the three profiles to the <b>Magic </b>brand team. They felt the tournament player needed a name, so they named him. Why "Spike?" The best I’ve been able to figure out is they felt Spike sounded like a serious, play-to-win-type name.</p>

<p>Spike is the competitive player. Spike plays to win. Spike enjoys winning. To accomplish this, Spike will play whatever the best deck is. Spike will copy decks off the Internet. Spike will borrow other players’ decks. To Spike, the thrill of <b>Magic </b>is the adrenalin rush of competition. Spike enjoys the stimulation of outplaying the opponent and the glory of victory.</p>

<p>Spike cares more about the quantity of wins than the quality. For example, Spike plays ten games and wins nine of them. If Spike feels he should have won the tenth, he walks away unhappy.</p>

<p>R&amp;D makes plenty of cards for Spike. Unlike the Timmy and Johnny cards, Spike cards are relatively easy to make. Spike plays what wins, so if R&amp;D makes a card good enough, Spike will play it. Good examples of Spike cards are <autocard>Call of the Herd</autocard>, <autocard>Shadowmage Infiltrator</autocard>, and <autocard>Fact or Fiction</autocard>.</p>

<h3>The Hybrids</h3>

<p>Many players do not fit so easily in one box. These players have bits and pieces of multiple profiles.</p>

<h3>Timmy/Johnny or Johnny/Timmy</h3>

<p>The Timmy/Johnny player likes the cool big effects but also enjoys the creative side of the game. A perfect example of a Timmy/Johnny card is <autocard>Haunting Echoes</autocard>. The card has a huge effect that attracts Timmy but offers cool deck potentials for Johnny. The Timmy/Johnny wants to smash his opponent, but with style.</p>

<h3>Timmy/Spike or Spike/Timmy</h3>

<p>The Timmy/Spike player wants to win, but also like to indulge his fun side. When picking a deck, Timmy/Spike will always pick the good deck with the biggest creatures or effects. A good example of a Timmy/Spike card is <autocard>Rith, the Awakener</autocard>. Rith is a big dragon, but one that’s costed aggressively with a good special ability.</p>

<h3>Johnny/Spike or Spike/Johnny</h3>

<p>The Johnny/Spike player wants to win but only on his own terms. Most of the rogue tournament deckbuilders are Johnny/Spikes. They go to great lengths to be able to win with original decks. Even when they have to use a pre-made deck, they will always tweak it to give the deck their own spin. A good example of a Johnny/Spike card is <autocard>Basking Rootwalla</autocard>. The card is cool and offers interesting deckbuilding opportunities but still has the raw power needed to win.</p>

<h3>Timmy/Johnny/Spike (All Three)</h3>

<p>The Timmy/Johnny/Spike players want it all. They want to play big cards, have innovative decks, and yet still win as much as possible. This hybrid is a rare breed as few players are pulled in all three directions. As such, R&amp;D does not design too many cards that hit all three profiles at once. One example of a card that appealed to all three groups was <autocard>Verdant Force</autocard>. Timmy liked its huge size, Johnny appreciated its combo possibilities, and Spike liked its utility in reanimation and <autocard>Natural Order</autocard>-based decks.</p>

<p>There you have it. These are the profiles R&amp;D considers when designing (and developing) cards. Be aware that these profiles apply to the motivations of the players and not the formats they play. Timmy can play in tournaments and Spike can play multi-player games. In a future article I will talk more about how R&amp;D designs cards specifically for competitive and casual play.</p>

<p>Anyway, that’s all for this column. Hopefully, it will give you all a little insight into one of the many facets R&amp;D considers when we design (and develop) each set.</p>

<p>Join me next week when I explore the <i>italic</i>.</p>

<p>Until then, may you always flip heads.</p>

The official rules are still under review at the time of this writing. When they are published, they can be found on our <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/gameplay/rules-and-formats/rules" target="_blank">rules page</a>. If there should be a discrepancy between this summary and the official rules, the official rules take precedence.</p>

<h1>New and Updated rules</h1>

<h2>Reconfigure</h2>

<h2>301.5c</h2>

<p>This is the rule that says an Equipment that's also a creature can't equip a creature. Obviously, this needs to change for reconfigure to work correctly. Now, this rule has an exception for Equipment with reconfigure.</p>

<h2>702.151</h2>

<p>This rule and its subrules define the keyword ability reconfigure. The first subrule tells us that reconfigure represents two activated abilities. Reconfigure [cost] means "[Cost]: Attach this permanent to another target creature you control. Activate only as a sorcery," and "[Cost]: Unattach this permanent. Activate only if this permanent is attached to a creature and only as a sorcery."</p>

<p>The rest of the subrules in this section explain that when an effect attaches an Equipment with reconfigure to another creature, it also causes the Equipment to stop being a creature as long as its attached and that if it's still somehow a creature after that, it becomes unattached.</p>

<h2>Vehicles</h2>

<h2>702.122a</h2>

<p>This is the rule for the crew ability. A lot of players may not have realized that Vehicles, once animated, could technically crew themselves. This is not only unintuitive but also pretty scary for people like me who don't trust self-driving cars. A one-word change to this rule now prevents players from being able to do this.</p>

<h2>701.22d</h2>

<p>Some Vehicles in this set, such as Mobilizer Mech, have abilities that trigger when they become crewed. This new rule tells us that "When this Vehicle becomes crewed" means "When a crew ability of this Vehicle resolves." This is notably different from a triggered ability that triggers when a creature crews a Vehicle, such as that found on Gearshift Ace. Those abilities trigger when you activate the crew ability rather than when it resolves. It's also worth noting that these abilities won't trigger if that Vehicle becomes a creature in any way other than its own crew ability.</p>

<h2>Compleated</h2>

<h2>107.4 and 107.4f</h2>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Tamiyo, Compleated Sage" src="https://media.wizards.com/2021/neo/en_ub8fLyqE7L.png" /></p>

<p>This is the rule that defines what the mana symbols are. Tamiyo, Compleated Sage uses a new hybrid Phyrexian mana symbol that needed to be added here. Even though no other cards have this symbol, the other nine hybrid Phyrexian symbols have been added here for compleateness.</p>

<h2>702.150</h2>

<p>This rule defines the replacement effect that the keyword ability compleated represents. Basically, for each time you pay life for a Phyrexian mana symbol in the cost of a planeswalker spell with compleated, if it would enter the battlefield with loyalty counters, it enters with that many counters minus two instead. It was very difficult to complete this rule with autocorrect on.</p>

<h2>Modified Creatures</h2>

<h2>700.9</h2>

<p>A modified creature is one that has one or more counters on it, is equipped, or is enchanted by an Aura that's controlled by that creature's controller. This new rule explains that in very similar words to the last sentence and also explains that only creatures can be modified.</p>

<h2>Other rules changes</h2>

<h2>406.3</h2>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="The Dragon Kami Reborn" src="https://media.wizards.com/2021/neo/en_SeMA6kIpvn.png" /></p>

<p>This is the rule that says that once a player has been allowed to look at cards in exile, that player may continue to look at those cards. As written, the rule only applied to cards that were exiled already when you were given permission to look at them. It didn't apply to situations where you look at a card <em>and then </em>exile it face down. Therefore, cards that do this also explicitly say you may look at those cards. When designing The Dragon-Kami Reborn, we challenged the need for this and decided to write this permission directly into the rules. Now, if an effect says to look at some cards and exile them face down, you may continue to look at those cards for as long as they are in exile. This is technically a functional change for one card ([autocard]Clone Shell[/autocard]), but my experience with that card is that most players already believed they could look at the exiled card again and were playing that way anyway.</p>

<h2>508.3d-f</h2>

<p>This is the section of rules that explains what abilities trigger when creatures attack. It has been updated to account for some newer trigger conditions. This does not functionally change any cards.</p>

<h2>602.5f</h2>

<p>Some rules tell you that certain words on older cards mean something different than what they say. For example, older cards that say "removed from the game" have been updated to say "exiled" instead. A rule exists to tell you that these are the same. When "Activate this ability only as a sorcery" was shortened to "Activate only as a sorcery" on many cards, a similar rule was added. However, since there is no functional difference or potential for confusion between the two templates, this rule is unnecessary and has been removed.</p>

<h2>616.1d</h2>

<p><em>Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty</em> Sagas are transforming double-faced cards that exile themselves and return to the battlefield transformed as creatures. A new rule clarifying when to apply the "enters the battlefield transformed" replacement effect covers an odd corner case by preventing players from choosing to have them also enter with a lore counter when entering the battlefield transformed.</p>

<h2>702.20b</h2>

<p>When a card tells you to search your library for a particular card, shuffle, then put that card on top, the card is technically still in your library at the time you are shuffling. This rule is the one that says you don't shuffle that card along with it, which allows this template to work properly. However, it turns out that it wasn't quite broad enough to cover [autocard]Ecological Appreciation[/autocard], so it has now been updated to do so. This is not a functional change to any card unless you were playing [autocard]Ecological Appreciation[/autocard] in a very strange way.</p>

<h2>707.8</h2>

<p>This rule explains what happens if you copy a double-faced permanent. Since double-faced permanents come from double-faced spells, and we can also copy those, this rule was generalized to cover double-faced cards in all zones.</p>

<h2>903.3a</h2>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Shorikai, Genesis Engine" src="https://media.wizards.com/2021/neo/en_jJP7AFmr40.png" /></p>

<p>Shorikai, Genesis Engine is a legendary Vehicle with an ability that says it can be your commander. The rule that supports this was given a minor tweak to make sure that ability functions properly on Vehicle cards.</p>

<h2>New Subtypes</h2>

<p>Kaito was added to the list of planeswalker types.</p>

<h2>New Glossary Entries</h2>

<p>Compleated, modified, reconfigure</p>

Its enlightenment seeps through the corpus of the Multiverse, touching, cleansing, <em>compleating </em>all places. You will know rapture in obeisance. Like all fragile things, you will bend to it but will not break—becoming something greater—and you will welcome it.</p>

<p>Welcome to <em>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</em>.</p>

<p>The Planeswalkers who gathered to stop the Phyrexians on Dominaria lost—badly. They failed to halt the Phyrexian schemes to stop heroes valiantly fighting their oldest foes. Now, every plane of the Multiverse is in Phyrexian sights with their plan to invade them all. The only hope that remains is to take them out on their home turf, destroying the Phyrexian's means to Multiverse invasion. The risk that some—all—of the heroes fall to Phyrexians is high, but the stakes for everyone else are even higher.</p>

<p>It's now or never for the heroes heading into danger. Planeswalkers team up and head down into New Phyrexia to end the threat of invasion once and for all. Ten total Planeswalkers appear as new cards in <em>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</em>, though which are heroes ready to fight the Phyrexians and which join the Phyrexians in compleated perfection is something the story will reveal.</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Planeswalkers Appearing in Phyrexia: All Will Be One" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/dkSv1PQsUQAN.png" /></p>

<p>All ten, as shown above (with previous artwork):</p>

</ul>

<p>(You can see Koth's new card below, with other new planeswalker cards to be revealed later with <em>Phyrexia: All Will Be One </em>previews.)</p>

<p>The heroic—and few—Mirran resistance forces remaining may be the Planeswalkers' best chance of striking at the heart of New Phyrexia.</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Jor Kadeen, First Goldwarden" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/8MdOUIQ0sO72.png" style="width: 265px; height: 370px;" /> <img alt="Koth, Fire of Resistance" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/PL0II6mmQfJa.png" style="width: 265px; height: 370px;" /></p>

<p>But Phyrexians aren't your typical villains. Some are horrifying.</p>

<p>Some are familiar&mdash;and relentless&mdash;such as the greatest praetor Elesh Norn, ruler of New Phyrexia and mastermind behind building the army poised to conquer the Multiverse.</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Elesh Norn, Mother of Machines" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/JiFJS8JS2DAd.png" style="width: 265px; height: 370px;" /> <img alt="Phyrexian-language Elesh Norn, Mother of Machines" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/4nZlKrOIKV1o.png" style="width: 265px; height: 370px;" /></p>

<p>Some villains remind those of us who remember the past of Mirrodin&mdash;and what's truly been lost.</p>

<p>New Phyrexia has only echoes of the Mirrodin plane we once knew as compleation brings it ever closer to twisted Phyrexian perfection.</p>

<h2>First Look at Booster Fun</h2>

<p>New Phyrexia, a place where flesh and metal are one in a hegemonic harmony, and there is one primary edict: spread the revelation of Phyrexian compleatness. From Phyrexian denizens and praetor rulers to the tools they use on the land itself—<em>all </em>reflects this exquisite <em>perfection</em>.</p>

<p>Compleat perfection means incredible cards to open in boosters for fans and Phyrexians alike.</p>

<p>Phyrexian panorama full art and Phyrexianized full-art basic lands can be found in <em>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</em> Draft, Set, and Collector Boosters.</p>

<p>The body-transformation horror of the Phyrexians is an unsettling sight, one that reaches beyond <em>Magic</em>. With art by Junji Ito and more artists, <em>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</em> features the borderless manga treatment for select Phyrexians and characters reimagined as Phyrexians for several heroes fighting them.</p>

<p>Though which are truly heroes and which become Phyrexians is a sleeper agent terror that Ajani's appearance in <em>Dominaria United</em> revealed all too well. You'll discover who truly remains a hero against the Phyrexians (and who falls to compleation) in the <em>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</em> story publishing January 12–17, <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/story" target="_blank">right here at DailyMTG</a>.</p>

<figcaption style="text-align:center; caption-side:top"><strong>Borderless Manga</strong></figcaption>
</div>

<p>Cards with the borderless manga treatment can be found in <em>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</em> Draft, Set, and Collector Boosters.</p>

<p>And that's not all—our return to New Phyrexia led us into our archives to look back at Elesh Norn and the rest of the praetors in concept artwork and vision. With <em>Phyrexia: All Will be One</em>, we can share all five together featuring their concept artwork from the rebirth of the Phyrexians. These borderless concept cards are reprints of praetors from recent sets (and will be legal where those sets are).</p>

<p>Borderless concept praetors can be found in <em>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</em> Draft, Set, and Collector Boosters.</p>

<p>New Phyrexia was borne from infection by oil—the insidious legacy of original Phyrexia that transforms people, places, and even entire <em>planes</em>—as happened to Mirrodin—into Phyrexian visions of perfection. Several Booster Fun treatments found in <em>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</em> draw on this theme and bring it to cards in the set, such as the ichor treatment.</p>

<div class="figure-wrapper">

</div>

<p>Cards with the ichor treatment can be found in <em>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</em> Draft, Set, and Collector Boosters.</p>

<p>While these amazing treatments can be found across Draft and Set Boosters, too, <em>Phyrexia: All Will Be One </em>Collector Boosters will always be the best way to find these amazing treatments. Plus, there's one more look that's only available in Collector Boosters: step-and-compleat foils.</p>

<p>These cards feature a unique foil treatment that reveals a pattern of the Phyrexian symbol, similar to the Greek letter Φ, across the card. It's a new look that isn't fully captured in the card images here—each step-and-compleat card features its own card ID number for you collectors out there—but we look forward to showing these off "in person" closer to the <em>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</em> release.</p>

<h2>Universes Within Expands with Set Boosters</h2>

<p><em>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</em> is dedicated to the horrors of Phyrexia—and our heroes desperate battle against them—but there's more waiting for <em>Magic </em>players in Set Boosters. <em>The List</em>—reprinted cards often thematically or flavorfully tied to recent <em>Magic </em>releases—will receive an update <em>and</em> include Universes Within versions of cards from the <em>Street Fighter x Secret Lair</em> drop.</p>

<p>These versions count just the same—each matching up and counting as the same "unique" card for deck-building purposes—but are flavored from within one of <em>Magic</em>'s own planes. Here's a look at them all coming with <em>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</em>:</p>

<p>We'll share details on how these Universes Within cards appear in <em>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</em> Set Boosters when previews kick off in January.</p>

<h2>All Will Be One</h2>

<p>Featuring a massive Planeswalker team-up with ten total planeswalker cards appearing in the set, <em>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</em> lets players move to take on the Phyrexians—or join their forces—with the fate of the Multiverse hanging in the balance.</p>

<p>Ten miles from the golden domes of Tomakul, Farid sat on the fire step of an old trench and used his knife to chip apart his frozen stew. Stoked with shattered arrow shafts and small wads of packing paper, the coals under the stewpot—his own brass cap, its liner removed—soon had the frozen slurry thawed and simmering. Without reverence, Farid shook the last of his salt out of a small tin into the broth, stirred, and felt his stomach twist with hunger at the thin scent of wild garlic and onions. The smell drew the rats out of their holes as well, but the cold made them sluggish. Farid watched one creep toward his rag-wrapped boots and stop to sniff him. It was fat, large as the golden cats that lounged in Tomakul's temple district streets, and carried itself with the same languid, waddling confidence. The rats owned the trench; the humans huddling in it were just temporary occupants, and food if they died. Farid kicked it away.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align:right;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/E5KhSE0CiS.jpg" /><p class="embedImageCaption">Art by: <a href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&amp;output=spoiler&amp;method=visual&amp;artist=+[%22Thomas%20Stoop%22]" target="_blank">Thomas Stoop</a></p></div></div>

<p>Their trench neared two decades old, a relic of the early war expanded into something resembling the great earthworks Farid had seen during the retreat out of the trans-Mardun territories of Yotia. Down where the Mardun river bordered Kroog, they had trench lines reinforced with squat stone towers. Bunkers that hid heavy bolt-throwers, subterranean hospitals and mess halls, weather-sealed bunks that were lit and warmed by smokeless powerstones. But all that was a year and miles behind him, abandoned after the Argivians and their allies began their counterattack. Life on the Mardun front was cold and boring until it wasn't.</p>

<p>Farid's war had been one year-long walk home with mechanized death at his back and pestilence where he slept. Every illusion he had of glory, honor, and adventure was ground to pulpy meal, pressed into the mud along with honor and humanity. Each trench Farid's unit had retreated to had been older, shallower, and found in greater disrepair. When the war was last this close to Tomakul, there had been no machines, just foot soldiers and cavalry; only the qadir's closest advisors knew what a dragon engine was, no one had seen an avenger, and Farid hadn't yet been born.</p>

<p>When Farid and his unit first tumbled into this trench, exhausted and bloodied by the artificer's cavalry, they found it a shallow ditch that stretched for a handful of miles across the valley floor, flooded, home only to the rats and the dead. They dug down into the earth, bailed out the water, and reinforced this old line for the realities of modern warfare. Now it was home, with underground dugouts to hide from thopter bombers on clear days, sapper-dug traps to sink advancing avengers and triskelions into the mud, and thickets of needle-wire strung across the front-facing side to tangle any charging enemies.</p>

<p>A month of cold work and thin living followed. Talk burbled through the trench of an attack, but Farid did not put too much stock in talk. Soldiers talked; attacks were slow, grand things these days. They needed soldiers to replace the dead and reinforce the living and officers to holler and shine. Thankfully, it seemed the generals never wanted to attack unless they had at least one dragon engine, or a division of the qadir's own machine soldiers to try and break the enemy line.</p>

<p>So, Farid cleaned his spear, kept his boots patched, rotated his socks, and cooked. This morning it was a stew. When it was ready, Farid poured a portion into Karrak's cup first, then the rest into his own. Farid nudged his friend, who sat wrapped in two cloaks, staring at the opposite wall of the muddy, frost-webbed trench.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align:right;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/o2hQjdZpyn.jpg" /><p class="embedImageCaption">Art by: <a href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&amp;output=spoiler&amp;method=visual&amp;artist=+[%22Bruno%20Biazotto%22]" target="_blank">Bruno Biazotto</a></p></div></div>

<p>"Food," Farid said. He had to shove Karrak again before he noticed. Karrak looked over, coughed, took the stew, and ate.</p>

<p>Farid blew on his own cup, sipped, and let the warm broth filter through him. He chewed a chunk of sodden bread and watched as a line of soldiers tromped around the sharp corner of the trench. They walked in single file, shuffling along the plank floor to keep their boots free of the rimy mud underneath. Eyes downcast, the soldiers all looked the same. The mud here dried pale, caking their boots and wool uniforms, staining the once-fine colors of the Imperial Fallaji army from dusty reds to cold shades of white, tan, and brown. All wore their helms wrapped in dark cloth, to prevent the sun from shining off the polished brass. They walked through the trench, short-stepped to not clip the heels of the soldier in front, shuffling to not be clipped by the soldier behind. Some leaned on their spears as they walked. All bowed under the weight of their packs.</p>

<p>"Hey," Farid said, calling up to the soldiers marching past. "Where are you going?"</p>

<p>None of them answered. Few even acknowledged him, and those that did just looked him over with fatigue-sunken eyes while they shuffled by. An older soldier whose coat bore a set of sewn-on sergeant's stripes passed, and Farid called out to her, asking where they were headed.</p>

<p>"Making room," the sergeant said. She stopped to adjust her pack, perching on the fire step. "Replacements due in this afternoon."</p>

<p>Farid cursed. Replacements. "They human?"</p>

<p>The sergeant shook her head. "All we were told was to make room for 'em. You have any more of that soup?"</p>

<p>It was Farid's turn to shake his head. "Just broth and bones now. What do you have?"</p>

<p>The sergeant thought for a moment, then fished into her coat. She pulled out a golden coin and held it out to Farid. It was one of the old ones, thick, with the last qadir's face stamped on both sides.</p>

<p>"For when you go home," the sergeant said. "Live like a qadir for a day in Tomakul, or an emperor for a week anywhere else."</p>

<p>Farid offered the sergeant the remains of the broth. She drank it down, then held the makeshift stewpot tipped to catch the last drops.</p>

<p>"Here, take this," Farid said, passing the sergeant one of the broth bones when he finished. "It's chicken, not rat."</p>

<p>"Chicken! Where did you find one of those?" The sergeant, grateful, took one of the bones.</p>

<p>"That miracle I cannot reveal," Farid said. "The quartermaster would have my head for it." He held a gloved finger to his lips, then pocketed the rest of the chicken bones in a pouch he wore at his waist. "Keep the coin. When you're qadir for a day, send us somewhere warm to dig a trench."</p>

<p>The sergeant laughed. She set the coin down on the fire step next to Farid anyways.</p>

<p>"For when you're home, my boy," the sergeant said, smiling.</p>

<p>Farid saluted. The sergeant nodded and hurried on to join the rest of her regiment as they shambled away. The unit passed through the trench for a few more minutes, the marching soldiers silent but for coughing, and the creaking and squelching of the trench's soggy floorboards. The wounded brought up the rear of the column—those who could walk, who could still carry and thrust a spear, were sent back to the front—shuffling with their heads down and eyes distant.</p>

<p>"A sorry lot we are," Karrak said. He'd come back from his distant staring. A wet cough roughened his voice. "Are you going to take that gold?" he asked Farid, eyeing the coin the sergeant had left on the fire step.</p>

<p>Farid looked at the coin. The sun had started to burn away the mist, and the gold gleamed in the cold morning light. He passed it to Karrak, who bit it and checked the impression. Satisfied, he tucked it into a pocket deep in his coat.</p>

<p>"Replacements, she said?" Karrak grunted.</p>

<p>"Replacements," Farid agreed.</p>

<p>"I hope they're machines," Karrak said. "Some of Mishra's. Not those dead things." Karrak coughed. "No more meat for this beast."</p>

<p>"I say give us the dead ones if it means we can go home," Farid said. "Let the qadir and his brother fight this war with their toy soldiers."</p>

<p>Karrak shrank into his coat and shivered. Farid reached out an arm and pulled him close. He could feel the heat Karrak threw off, like a brazier filled to the brim with coals. The same plague that had savaged him just two weeks prior, Farid guessed.</p>

<p>An officer—a captain in a pristine uniform but for mud-stained boots—brought up the rear of the marching soldiers. Farid noticed him a second too late. Cursing, he stood. Karrak struggled, but Farid hauled his friend up and held him as the captain marched past. The two of them saluted and the captain ignored them, consulting instead a sheaf of orders that a runner had passed him. The runner, a youth in a similarly pristine uniform, paced alongside, hopping between the fire step and the plank walkway above the muddy trench floor, taking notes as the captain rattled off orders to be dispersed to various units up and down the line.</p>

<p>Farid and Karrak and the rest of the men in their section stood for as long as it took for the captain to pass. When the officer turned the corner and was out of sight, they sat back down on the fire step, slouched back into their dugouts, and curled back up to sleep.</p>

<p>Winter's deep chill sank into Farid. He watched over Karrak as his friend shivered. Officers, movement, replacements, and reinforcements–activity. Nothing good could come of activity. Activity meant action, and action meant going over the top, into the blades and fire of the machines.</p>

<hr />
<p>The replacements arrived the next day, stooped under their heavy packs, yet to be lightened by the practicalities of war. They were human, not Mishran automatons or those stinking mechanical corpses; a mix of old men and women, out-of-place youths drawn from the farthest corners of the empire, haggard soldiers ferried over from the newly pacified Sarinth, and convicts. The replacements tromped through the trenches, eyes down, under the silent stares of the soldiers long on the line.</p>

<p>Some looked to Farid as if they came from Tomakul, though most of the replacements seemed to be desert types: thin before arriving at the front, either swallowed by their uniforms or barely able to fit into them. A scattering of Zegonians passed, talking in their quiet tongue. A pair of broad, tattooed Sumifans marched past, a nervous song on their lips that left a taste of ozone on the air. A penal unit marched by at a quick step, closely watched by their broad and rough-tongued minders, the lot of them simmering with such a mix of fear, desperation, and brutality that Farid was glad to see them continue down the line, not stopping at his post.</p>

<p>Some of the replacements carried themselves with an air of defiance, but most peered out at the brasscaps with wide eyes, all pity and fear; the front never looked like what you wanted it to. Farid recalled that he had expected to see knights and champions and all that when he first arrived; instead, he found a city compressed into a canal of gray stone and mud a dozen yards wide and miles long, populated by fearsome and beautiful warriors with equally fearsome and beautiful weapons, all arranged toward the glittering Mardun and the ruins of Kroog beyond the river.</p>

<p>Truth was, the front was hell: a nightmare made by men. You dare look too long at its population, and you'd see what you would become: hollow-eyed and sinewy, caked with mud. Gaunt soldiers in uniforms bleached and patched and stained. Farid was glad that moment was behind him. Better to already be the ghost.</p>

<p>At last, the officers came. Lieutenants by their stripes and sashes, shepherding the replacements to their new posts. The young officers carried that Tomakul sturdiness about them and, unlike the soldiers they led, actually wore brass caps and rose cloaks trimmed in gold cloth. Their armor was polished, and they still carried swords. Farid, broke away from the marching mass of soldiers with a squad of replacements in tow.</p>

<p>"Soldier," the lieutenant called to Farid. "What company are you in?"</p>

<p>Farid stood from the fire step and brushed his trousers flat. "D Company," he said, saluting. "Third Tomakul Spears, commanded by Colonel—"</p>

<p>"Sure, fine, that'll do," the lieutenant said. "These are yours, spearman." The lieutenant waved the squad of replacements forward. "Welcome to D company of the Third Tomakul Spears," he said to the replacements. "That spearman will be your senior here," the lieutenant said, pointing to Farid. "Look to him for guidance. I'll be in the officers' dugout that way," the lieutenant waved down the line. "Parade is an hour after dawn tomorrow under the company flags. Dismissed." The lieutenant tugged his brass cap, adjusting it, and then squelched off through the muddy trench, leaving the replacements to Farid.</p>

<p>As soon as the young officer was away down the trench, Farid swore, slumped free of his rigid parade stance, and waved the replacements over. Ten men—mostly youths a few years younger than him and an ancient veteran missing an eye—walked together in a rattling clump of brown wool coats, packs, and long spears.</p>

<p>"Welcome to the Argivian Front," Farid said. "I'm Farid of the Tomakul. This here is Karrak of the Suwwardi," Farid said. "The rest you'll meet at some point. Talk to the quartermaster down that way, she'll get you your regimental patch and some thread to stitch on the company letter," Farid thumbed down the trench, and the replacements all turned to look. "Any of you from Tomakul? Or are you all from the desert tribes?"</p>

<p>The group nodded. The older veteran stared forward with his good eye. He had the same look as Karrak—he was anywhere but here; he was nowhere at all.</p>

<p>"I'd never been out of the city before the war," Farid said to the assembled replacements. "Never been out in the deep desert—I heard it got cold at night, but never expected this. At least the Mist Moon is a great beauty." Farid looked around at the wide-eyed replacements. Nothing there but fear. "Why are you standing?" He said to them. "Grab a seat, find a bunk."</p>

<p>There were little cavities and burrows dug into the trench wall and reinforced by planks, their muddy floors covered with strips of burlap and torn clothing taken from dead soldiers. The replacements scrambled to grab the good ones. Each vacant dugout burrow had housed someone who went over the wall and never came back, and the dead always left small trinkets behind; if you were lucky, you might find something valuable to trade to the quartermaster for smokes or nabiz.</p>

<p>"Have you seen the enemy, sir?" one of the younger replacements asked as they settled into the dugouts. "The Argivians and their machine devils?" The replacement swam under his brown, undyed cloak. He carried a spear, around the blade of which a thin ribbon of rose silk was tied. Farid first thought it a favor from a beloved that the boy had tied on, but as he looked at the replacements' weapons, he realized they all had a similar ribbon fastened to their spears. That was the new mark of regiment, Farid realized. No more brass caps for the brasscaps. The boy, like the rest of the replacements, wore only a soft field cap with flaps tied down over his ears instead of the proud helms Farid and the rest of the long-deployed soldiers had been issued. They must need the metal for more automatons, Farid figured.</p>

<p>"I have seen them," Farid said. "Their machines as well."</p>

<p>"How many have you killed?" the replacement asked, eager.</p>

<p>Farid thought for a moment, recalling what he could of his year on campaign. He shrugged. "I don't think I've killed any."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>Farid looked to Karrak. "Have you killed any Argivians? Any Yotians?"</p>

<p>Karrak, always bundled, shook his head. "None," he rasped from his wrappings. "I seen many dead. Never killed one myself."</p>

<p>"Come to think of it, I've never even clashed with one blade to spear," Farid said. He flashed the long knife he wore at his side, then nodded toward his can opener—a sturdy pike about as tall as he, with a flat head that tapered to a sharp point.</p>

<p>"These are can openers. We use them on Urza's machines—though I've only ever used mine on fallen avengers and thopter wrecks," Farid said. "Closest I've been to using these in a proper fight was when we followed a unit of scythe runners into a trench. All the Argivians were dead by the time we arrived."</p>

<p>"Seen many dead," Karrak agreed.</p>

<p>"Told you." One of the other replacements said, nudging his fellow. "Trench rats," he said. "Disgraceful cowards. No wonder the Argivians have pushed us so far from Kroog—nothing but soft city-dwellers between them and the heart of our empire."</p>

<p>Farid and Karrak laughed. Some of the other soldiers who had been eavesdropping chuckled, shook their heads, and continued resting, eating, or maintaining their worn equipment.</p>

<p>"The Argivians are only two hundred yards that way," Farid said, thumbing over his shoulder in the direction of the Argivian trench. "You want to storm their line? Wait another hour—the rising sun will be at your back and then you can strike like the midday sun on the head of a waterless traveler," Farid said.</p>

<p>"That—that is exactly what we should do!" The replacement spluttered. He was the bravest of his companions, but they all nodded along with him. "Why are we not driving them off our land?"</p>

<p>Farid stood from the fire step and stepped toward the young man. "How old are you?" he asked, sizing up the youth.</p>

<p>"Fifteen," the replacement said, looking to the side but not stepping back. The boy stood an inch or so taller than Farid, who affected a permanent stoop after this time in the trenches.</p>

<p>"What's your name, boy?"</p>

<p>"Assad."</p>

<p>Farid drew his knife. Assad stepped back, bumping into his companions.</p>

<p>Farid grinned, then turned and stabbed his knife deep into the plank wall of the trench behind him. He levered out a chunk of rotting wood, sheathed his knife, and reached into the earth. He pulled a double handful of clay out from the cavity, dug a few scrapes deeper, and then wrenched something from deep inside the trench wall. He turned and held out a rag-wrapped length of bone, matted hair still clinging to the fetid remains.</p>

<p>"You're younger than this trench," Farid tossed the bone to the ground at the youth's boots. "But not by much." He pointed to the ragged, soggy bone. "Look at that bone. That was a person—can you tell me which uniform they wore?"</p>

<p>The youth stared at the bone and did not answer. The rest of his cadre were silent.</p>

<p>"This land doesn't matter," Farid growled. "You got a cloak?" Farid asked the group. They all nodded, some even grabbing the corners of the cloaks they wore to show him.</p>

<p>"Boots?"</p>

<p>Again, the youths showed Farid the plain but sturdy boots they all wore.</p>

<p>"Good," Farid said. "Listen to me and learn my lesson well: your cloak and boots matter more to you than this trench. If the Argivians make it through our wire, if their metal avengers lead the way, if it looks like we're going to lose this line, you grab your cloak and you grab your boots and you run." Farid kicked the bone off the planks and into the soggy mud of the trench floor. "There's always another trench. Might not always be another cloak or pair of boots." He waited until each of the boys nodded at him. "Good. Lesson over. You're dismissed."</p>

<p>The replacements shuffled away. One remained, not moving from where he stood: the old, one-eyed veteran. He leaned on his spear with the comfort of a killer.</p>

<p>"How long?" the old veteran asked.</p>

<p>"A year and some months as of the start of winter," Farid said. "Karrak here has counted three. You?"</p>

<p>"I lost my eye at the Siege of Kroog," the old veteran said. "Served in the supply corps for a year following, and then they sent me back to train new warriors."</p>

<p>"The Siege?" Farid whistled. "I was only a baby when Kroog burned." Farid waved the old veteran over to sit next to him on the fire step. "What's your name, uncle?"</p>

<p>"Aiman," the old veteran said, setting his pack down. Aiman's voice was low and soft. The old man looked around the trench line, taking it in. "The war has changed since I was last a part of it," he said. "More mud." He fixed his good eye on Farid. "You all are still children."</p>

<p>"The qadir's war," Farid said. He looked away and spat. "We all must do our part."</p>

<hr />
<p>Weeks after the arrival of the replacements, lieutenants and captains hustled up and down the trench line with trails of supply and logistics officers in tow. Grumbling and muttering quartermasters were forced to distribute tins of armor polish, new gloves, squares of cloth with which the spearmen were meant to patch their crimson cloaks, bolts of silk, and other useless things. They also doled out extra rations of nabiz and mutton that were well received by the young replacements, but who did not know what extra rations of wine and mutton meant. In the mornings, the soldiers were woken by runners and their sergeants for parade formations, ordered to line up as best one could in the narrow confines of the trench for presentations to the majors and colonels who walked with scarves held to their noses through the places where the soldiers lived.</p>

<p>Farid, Karrak, and Aiman knew this was not routine. The young, fresh replacements did not. They all thought this was a mighty refutation to Farid's chilly warnings made only days prior. Assad let Farid know as much after their section was dismissed following this morning's inspection.</p>

<p>"Not so bad, this life," Assad said, overloud, to the coterie of conscripts that followed him. "You just need to lose that city softness, you see?" He exhaled a powerful breath, sending a plume of steam roiling out into the cold morning air. He beat a fist against his firm stomach. "Carry that desert heat in your belly and love for our empire in your heart, and you'll never see a sad day in this mighty force," Assad said. "Our qadir means to set us on the attack again." He looked to Farid, smiling. "And I think everyone here should clamor to cover himself in glory after this last year of defeat. Only way to wipe away that shame is to put Tomakul to our back and send the Argivians running, right boys?"</p>

<p>A cheer went up among the replacements and—to Farid's dismay—even among some of the soldiers who had been on the line for months now. Fool's courage, second only to fear, spread quick as fevers. Only those who had been on the line for an actual attack and lived resisted the fervor.</p>

<p>Farid did not engage with Assad. He was not a fighter; besides, he had plans to make.</p>

<p>That evening, Farid, Karrak, and Aiman huddled together in a deep dugout and spoke in hurried whispers over a single low candle.</p>

<p>"Tonight, before dawn," Karrak said.</p>

<p>"Right," Farid said. "The attack is certainly coming by the end of the week. We need to go tonight."</p>

<p>"And how will they know to expect us?" Aiman asked.</p>

<p>"That I can't tell you," Farid said. "Not yet."</p>

<p>"Fine," Aiman grunted. "Whatever gets me through it, I won't complain."</p>

<p>"Good man," Farid said.</p>

<p>"If it must be tonight, then who do we trust to bring in?" Karrak, whose fever had finally broken, spoke around the warm smoke of the trenchroll he smoked. He offered it to Farid, who shook his head. Aiman plucked the roll instead.</p>

<p>"Not Assad," Aiman said. "He reminds me too much of the ones I fought with at Kroog. All muscle and no think."</p>

<p>"Jamal?" Karrak offered.</p>

<p>"Jamal could be good," Farid agreed.</p>

<p>"He's quick," Karrak said. "And quiet."</p>

<p>"No," Aiman said. "Jamal is Sarinthian. The qadir only just suppressed their rebellion," Aiman said. He shook his head. "I like Jamal, but no one outside the unit will trust him. If we get caught out there with a Sarinthian<nbsp> . . .</nbsp>" Aiman drew his thumb across his throat.</p>

<p>"Right, good point." Farid sighed. He ran a hand over his shorn head. "Damn it, Karrak. Why do we have to take someone new?"</p>

<p>Karrak shook his head. "Sergeant said we have to take someone new to make it look convincing. Says the lieutenant told him that the colonel has ordered night patrols to be teams of four." He shrugged. "If it's just the three of us, we look suspicious."</p>

<p>"Fine," Farid said. "Four it is."</p>

<p>"Ehsan," Aiman said. "Ehsan is nobody. He'll do as he's told and stay quiet after."</p>

<p>"Ehsan?" Farid looked to Karrak, who shrugged. "Perfect," Farid said. "Aiman, you go get young Ehsan."</p>

<p>Aiman nodded and touched his brow. He scooted back from the candle and pulled himself out of the dugout. Farid and Karrak listened to the sound of his boots tromping away down the trench. When they faded and they were alone, Karrak finally spoke.</p>

<p>"Can we trust Aiman?"</p>

<p>Farid looked up at the canvas flap that covered the entrance to their dugout.</p>

<p>"I trust that he wants to live," Farid said. "Same as you and me and everyone else the war didn't kill yet."</p>

<p>"Just as well," Karrak grunted in a tone Farid knew to mean agreement. "Aiman knows who the real enemy is."</p>

<p>A commotion outside broke the long silence that followed. Boots thudding past on the plank flooring of the trench, excited murmurs and cursing. A shout.</p>

<p>Karrak started to his feet, hand to the long knife at his belt. Farid darted past him, bursting out into the trench in time to collide with a group of soldiers jogging past. They all tumbled to the ground, cursing and blaming each other for their clumsiness. Trading shoves, they pulled each other to their feet and parted. Farid hollered curses at the soldiers as they hustled down the trench; they shouted curses back, but they continued down the line.</p>

<p>"What's going on?" Karrak asked, poking his head out from the dugout. Not an attack—if there was an attack, it would be much louder. This was something else.</p>

<p>"I don't know," Farid said. He stepped to the side as more soldiers jogged past. "Something down that way, maybe a fight, maybe some new war machine." Farid offered his hand down to Karrak. "You coming?"</p>

<p>Karrak laughed and ducked back inside their dugout, twitching the curtain closed behind him. A no, then. Farid buttoned his coat against the evening's chill and joined the stream of curious troopers heading down the trench, shuffling along with them through the zigs and zags and blastbreaks. Though the sun had only just set and the world above the trench still clung to the day's light, the belly of the battleworks were plunged already into deep night. The trench's lights hummed on and burned dim, banishing the umbral dark with warm, blood-red light. To Farid that light–meant to save their vision in case of a nighttime assault–always made everything seem darker. To this moment it added a special horror.</p>

<p>Muttering filtered through the close-packed soldiers ahead. A pair of troopers crouched at the lip of the trench, offering their hands down to help haul any who wanted up. Whatever drew this crowd happened behind their line; it was not the Argivians.</p>

<p>When it was Farid's turn, both soldiers hauled him up. They were silent, grim-faced, ashen. Farid did not ask questions. The last fingers of light bled below the horizon. Dozens of soldiers stood a short distance away, their breath puffing white into the deepening night sky. Red and green lights flashed and slipped through the gaps in this wall of bodies.</p>

<p>Farid went alone to join them.</p>

<p>The stink hit Farid first. Like an open latrine pit before the sanitary corps got to it, or a battlefield thick with the dead. A weight to the chilly evening air. He pushed through the crowd, which seemed more than willing to part. Some of the soldiers even turned and started back to the trench, prayers tumbling from their lips.</p>

<p>The sound of chains and marching. The crunch of frosted ground trod over by hundreds of bare feet. The dim red and green nightlights topped poles carried by their minders, marker lights that the chained creatures followed. The dead ones. Farid thought he felt the blood drain from his face. Transmogrants. Hideous, piteous things that were once human, now a rotting amalgam of flesh and machine.</p>

<p>Whispers spread through the line of onlooking soldiers as the transmogrants marched past not ten yards away. The work of Mishra's protege, these things. The fate of any who died on the line, or those who passed of illness, or those who did not want to fight when the conscription gangs came to take them.</p>

<p>The transmogrants were chained together at their ankles with some distance allowed between them, but they moved at a uniform step, more perfect than any drilled line of human soldiers Farid had seen. In the dying, light he could not make out many details of these horrors, but what he did see burned into his memory. He saw dead and graying skin, scoured from the cold and the sun, stretched and woven through dark metal. They walked without outward care of the cold. They carried no weapons, but wicked claws burst from weeping stumps. Bloodless flaps with dead tufts of hair pulled taught over polished metal domes. Chain veils hiding the ruins of faces, but not the hot breath puffing out from between the links.</p>

<p>Farid's stomach soured, but he did not retch. The horror of what he saw made sense. It was the battlefield he knew, embodied in a decaying legion of killing machines. Farid pitied the people these things had been. He pitied himself. He turned to head back. By the time he reached the trench a short distance away, officers had already begun shouting and bellowing at the soldiers to head back to their posts, lest they be volunteered for mechanical service.</p>

<p>The night was cold. Outside Farid's dugout, the trench was alive with movement. Soldiers quietly hustled by with crates of handheld bombs, replacement spearheads, bomb-lance tips, armor-piercing bolts, wire-cutters, spare powerstones, and various other ordnance.</p>

<p>An attack was coming. Farid guessed they would be ordered over the top within the week. He did not sleep, and neither did Karrak or Aiman. Instead, with Ehsan sitting confused but silent with them, the four spearmen huddled together over a dim candle and planned for a long night.</p>

<hr />
<p>Farid, Karrak, and Aiman, with Ehsan between them, moved quietly and quickly through the trench, taking care not to disturb any of the sleeping soldiers. They carried only their knives, no spears, and left their brass caps behind, favoring instead dark clothing and soft wool caps. Ehsan didn't ask any questions, though Farid could tell he had many. The boy was as quiet as Aiman promised he was, small and quick, likely no older than fourteen.</p>

<p>Farid carried one of the red-lensed nightlights. It was powered by a powerstone chip and burned dim enough not to call attention, but bright enough to dispel some of the trench's deep darkness.</p>

<p>"Wait here," Farid said, pointing the nightlight at a wooden sign. Aiman put his hands on Ehsan's shoulders to steady him—he was old enough to be the boy's grandfather, Farid thought. Karrak held a trenchroll between his lips but did not light it.</p>

<p>"Sergeant Usman," Farid whispered as he crept into this section of trench. He knocked quietly on the planks outside of each dugout, calling the sergeant's name. "Sergeant Usman, it's Farid of D Company, Third Tomakul Spears."</p>

<p>A rustle, and one of the dugout flaps flipped back. "You're late, Farid," Sergeant Usman said, crawling out from his dugout. "I expected you an hour ago." He yawned, tugged his cap down around his ears, and crossed his arms for warmth. "Where are your men?"</p>

<p>"Here," Farid said. He looked back to Karrak, Aiman, and Ehsan and waved them over. The three of them moved quietly to join them.</p>

<p>"Good, four, good," Usman said, tallying the small group. "Here, one moment." Usman whistled between his teeth, a short and clipped sound that slipped quickly away into the night. Another soldier emerged from a dugout with an armful of soft satchels. Usman took them and passed them to Farid, who handed them out one by one to his companions.</p>

<p>"One full satchel for me and my boys, remember," Usman said, wagging a finger at Farid. "Or I talk, and you join the machines."</p>

<p>"Uncle, you'll be cheering when I return," Farid said, a quick smile on his lean face. "Do you have the order chit?"</p>

<p>Usman reached into his coat and pulled out a ring of thin, tin tabs. He snapped one off and held it out to Farid.</p>

<p>"You'll need to think of an excuse for why you're late and far from your unit," Usman said. "But that chit will make your story believable to any officer that might stop you."</p>

<p>"Outstanding," Farid said, reaching for the chit. Usman did not release it.</p>

<p>"One full satchel," Usman said. "If it's not bursting at the seams—"</p>

<p>"You'll talk," Farid said. "It's not my first time, sergeant, don't worry. You'll have a full satchel by the dawn."</p>

<p>Usman released the chit. Farid pocketed it and Usman waved toward the fire step, where a ladder had been built into the trench wall. "We cut the wire this morning. Go up here and stay low. Whistle when you return."</p>

<p>"You'll hear a tune as pretty as the flowers of Tomakul," Farid said, turning from the sergeant. "Boys, let's go." Farid crossed the trench and tested the ladder. Finding it sturdy, he started to climb. Karrak followed, with Ehsan and Aiman bringing up the rear.</p>

<p>As Ehsan watched the other men's boots disappear over the lip of the trench, he hesitated. The boy looked back to Aiman, who he had followed close behind until now.</p>

<p>"Uncle," Ehsan whispered to Aiman. "Where are we going?"</p>

<p>"Quiet," Aiman whispered.</p>

<p>"Are we going to fight?"</p>

<p>"No," Aiman said. "Now, up over the top—and be quick, we don't want any officers to see us," he said. He gave Ehsan a soft push, encouraging him to climb. "I'll be right behind you."</p>

<p>War had ruined Farid's faith, but he still regarded the world above the trench as hell. It was a place out of balance. Paradise was all things distributed in harmony and proper apportionment: the balances of stone, fire, sky, and water, imbued in one's body and soul, in the land and in dreams.</p>

<p>No-man's-land then was the opposite, a crucible into which people were fed and ghosts emerged. It was a hell of the body, the soul, dreams, and the land. It was colder up here than in the trenches: Every surface was exposed to the bitter valley wind and watching eyes of soldiers on both sides. Nothing remained of the forest that once filled this valley. The trees that hadn't been harvested before this valley became a battlefield were now cinder-blackened stumps. The river that once coursed here had been dammed somewhere near Tomakul to deny the Argivians any of its bounty. Of the towns that once dotted the valley, only a single low, ragged stone wall remained. It was a landmark to the soldiers: how far from the wall has one moved in a year? How close to it?</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align:right;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/GbVYQSv9bR.jpg" /><p class="embedImageCaption">Art by: <a href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&amp;output=spoiler&amp;method=visual&amp;artist=+[%22Sergey%20Glushakov%22]" target="_blank">Sergey Glushakov</a></p></div></div>

<p>Farid led his small group across this alien landscape, moving as quickly and quietly as he could while scurrying, belly low to the ground, guiding his party around the worst of the dead and the craters flooded with sour water. One crossed this hellscape by scrambling between craters and along old and decaying plank walkways, laid by advancing forces in long-forgotten attacks. One plankway had its builders' corpses rotting alongside, festooned with order chits dropped upon them by soldiers from both sides, grateful for their sacrifice in making this place more navigable.</p>

<p>They reached their first landmark without incident: a downed bomber thopter, a heavy Argivian flying craft that resembled a fat-bellied bird. The four of them crawled inside through a rent in its thin metal fuselage.</p>

<p>"Damned cough," Karrak said. He wheezed, struggling to breathe.</p>

<p>"Take a moment," Farid said. "All of you, take a moment to rest here."</p>

<p>"Like a wanderer gull," Aiman said, peering through the dusty glass of the thopter's crew compartment. "Great big birds that would soar alongside my father's ship." He spoke out loud, but to Farid it seemed as if he talked to only himself. Aiman looked through the wreckage toward the Argivian lines. "I never saw them land. I never thought they could."</p>

<p>"Where are we?" Ehsan said. His voice was still high and soft, very much a child's.</p>

<p>"Lower than the Nine Hells," Karrak grumbled. He set his heavy pack down on the damp floor of the thopter, groaning in relief at the weight off his shoulders. One hand rubbing his throat, he clambered over to Aiman and tapped him on the shoulder. "Let me look."</p>

<p>Farid offered Ehsan a sip of his water. The boy took it, drank, and passed it back.</p>

<p>"About fifty yards that way—where Aiman and Karrak are looking—is the Argivian line," Farid said.</p>

<p>Ehsan looked bug-eyed toward the enemy lines.</p>

<p>"Don't worry," Farid said. "We're not going to attack"—he indicated the packs Karrak and Aiman carried—"We're going to trade. All we have to do is hang this flag here," he said as he pulled a short bolt of white cloth out from a pocket on his coat. "And wait."</p>

<p>"I don't think I've ever seen an Argivian before," Ehsan said. "I was wondering how I'd kill one without a spear—the officers said they're made out of metal, and all I have is this little knife."</p>

<p>"It's not the people you gotta worry about," Karrak said.</p>

<p>"They die quick as cut flowers," Aiman said, agreeing. "Same as us."</p>

<p>"We're not going to kill anyone," Farid said, quieting the group. "You can keep that knife hidden away, Ehsan. You won't need it, unless it is to cut chocolate or sausage."</p>

<p>Ehsan smiled at the mention of chocolate. Farid could tell it had been a long time since Ehsan last smiled. For that matter, it had been a long time since Farid had smiled. It took humanity to smile and mean it, and Farid had none. This was not a condemnation; it was an admission, a necessary act of survival. Tunnel your vision to the task at hand and survive.</p>

<p>Farid, quickly, hung the strip of cloth on the outside of the crashed thopter, facing the Argivian trenches. Then, they settled in to wait.</p>

<p>The cold pre-dawn night was endless, stretching across this blasted valley from Tomakul to Kroog and beyond. It wormed into the hearts and desires of every bejeweled lord and power-hungry emperor, flooded their eyes like blood in milk. Eager, they reared up and sent a million of their children to fuel the night's appetite, which was now indistinguishable from their own.</p>

<p>Farid was only one of millions. The princes of the world would see Ehsan's soul added to the butcher's tally and, unmoved, call for a million more.</p>

<p>He looked to Ehsan, reached out, and patted his cheek.</p>

<p>"You don't need to worry," he said. "You'll be fine."</p>

<p>And then an explosion boomed somewhere in the distance, followed by a series of sharp pops and long, sizzling whines. Spotting flares launched from both sides illuminated a section of trench and no-man's-land a mile and a half down the line, far enough that the light from the flares' ignition flashed a heartbeat before the sound of their detonation. They could hear the echoes of distant screams somewhere down the valley but could not tell whose side cried out.</p>

<p>"Down," Farid hissed. He waved his palm down and put a finger to his lips. "Down, now!"</p>

<p>The four of them dropped to the shadowed belly of the crashed thopter, hands over their heads, and waited. The harsh, steady light of the parachuting flares cast stark and nightmarish shadows through the cracked and dirty glass of the ornithopter's crew compartment and bombing windows. That light was unrelenting, white and furious, the gaze of a god who only knew fire.</p>

<p>The thunder quieted. Not a battle, just a fight of no consequence. Farid let out a long and trembling exhale. He counted as the light from the flares faded and night returned.</p>

<p>"They're coming," Aiman said. He peered through the thopter's dusty glass canopy. "I see four of them at least, thirty yards distant."</p>

<p>"Just them, right?" Karrak asked. "No avengers? No walkers?"</p>

<p>"Just them," Aiman said. "Farid?"</p>

<p>Farid looked over to Ehsan, who had crawled into a corner, pale-faced and trembling. His hopeful smile gone. The boy knew he would never be fine. Even if by some grace Farid could resurrect this ornithopter and fly it home, Ehsan would never be a child again. None of them could steal back what had been ripped from them. It was easy to become one of the next million, harder to resist the momentum of lords and emperors. Unless—</p>

<p>"Karrak," Farid said. "Go greet our friends."</p>

<hr />
<p>The Argivians spoke some Fallaji, and likewise Farid, Karrak, and Aiman had some Argivian. Four Argivians clambered into the wreck of the bomber. One of them produced a canteen filled with some acrid spirit, Karrak broke out his trenchrolls, and the soldiers got to talking, joking, and swapping small things. Though hesitant at first, Ehsan soon joined the rest of them, and the eight soldiers together made a warm escape from the war. In the wreckage of the downed ornithopter, this small group may as well have been comfortable acquaintances at a cafe in Tomakul or a tea shop in Argive; if Farid closed his eyes, he could almost imagine a world outside of this one.</p>

<p>"I want to apologize for being late," the Argivian leader said in lightly accented Fallaji. She was a windbitten woman who reminded Farid of his mother. Stern, but he could see the laugh lines worn into her face. Laria, Farid remembered her name.</p>

<p>"Crossing our line was difficult," Laria said. "Lots of officers. Many new ones." She pointed to her eyes, and then to her group. "They don't trust us, so they watch."</p>

<p>Karrak grunted. "Sounds like officers," he said, speaking his own rough Argivian. "Always looking to use their swords."</p>

<p>The Argivians chuckled. Laria smiled. She looked past Farid and Karrak to Aiman and Ehsan, who, though part of the group, had kept quiet. "And who are they?"</p>

<p>"This is Ehsan," Aiman said, speaking before Farid could. The old man's Argivian, though accented, was perfect; he spoke with the comfort of one who had heard a language young and grown up with it close. "He's new on the line, from Tomakul. My name is Aiman. I am not new to the line, though I thought myself retired from the war many years ago after I was wounded."</p>

<p>"You speak our language well," Laria said. She switched to Argivian and introduced herself. Farid only caught a few words as she and Aiman carried on a rapid, gregarious conversation. Farid watched the two of them talk and felt a distant sort of hope. Aiman, like Ehsan, could still spark into the person he was before the war—the only difference was he had been through it before. The old man had been shoved into hell, all but torn to ribbons by the death machines there, and still knew how to make someone laugh. His smile was not sweet; many of his teeth were missing and the scars that webbed out from his ruined eye tugged at the corner of his mouth. But it was a beautiful smile. Laria's quiet laughter was the sound of Farid's sisters and mother, kneading dough.</p>

<p>This moment was good. The war didn't make this moment happen; it happened despite the war. Farid looked from Aiman's broken smile to Laria's graying hair, Karrak's gaunt face to the bandaged brow of the Argivian soldier he compared and traded knives with. Farid was not a poet, but the beauty of this moment sat with him. He committed to memory the tragedy of this little peace: their blood was the ink in which lord and emperors rewrote the borders of the world.</p>

<p>"It's nearing dawn," Laria said after some kind hours passed. The eight of them were well comfortable now, their helms discarded and packs piled, laden with the goods they all brought to trade. "We should get back."</p>

<p><em>Now</em>, Farid thought. The mighty could not write without ink; rob them of their medium. "There is an attack coming," Farid said. "Our officers have been preparing an assault. The whole front."</p>

<p>Laria raised an eyebrow. She looked to her soldiers, who paused as they adjusted their packs.</p>

<p>"Farid," Karrak said, speaking Fallaji. "This could get us killed."</p>

<p>"Quiet," Farid snapped.</p>

<p>Karrak quieted, glowering. Farid ignored him and continued, switching back to Argivian.</p>

<p>"Our generals have moved in a whole regiment of transmogrants—the qadir's dead men," Farid said. "Those silks and kits we gave you? They passed them out to us just days ago. They've given us wine and meat. Brought in thousands of replacements from across the Empire," he said, gesturing to Aiman and Ehsan.</p>

<p>Laria nodded. Any soldier this long on the line knew what extra rations and troop movements meant. "Thank you, Farid," she said. She looked to Aiman and spoke to him in Argivian, far too fast for Farid to understand. Aiman responded, Laria smiled, and with a salute, she and her troops left the ornithopter.</p>

<p>"What did she say?" Farid asked Aiman.</p>

<p>"Clay statues," Aiman said.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Their general," Aiman said. "A man named Tawnos. He's an artificer in service to their Lord Urza. He has brought with him a dozen units of his Clay Soldiers." Aiman nodded toward the Argivian line. "Laria said they know our attack is coming. They've been preparing for weeks. It's going to be a slaughter on both sides," Aiman said. "But if we stay back, she said, it will only be a slaughter of machines."</p>

<p>Farid exhaled. He had been holding his breath the whole time without realizing it. He looked at Karrak, who was pale.</p>

<p>"We have to keep this to ourselves," Karrak said. He looked at Aiman and Ehsan. "We can't tell anyone."</p>

<p>"I know," Farid said.</p>

<p>"If anyone else discovers that we know this," Karrak whispered, "we'll be hung as traitors if we don't die first."</p>

<p>"Yeah," Farid nodded. He closed his eyes and sighed. Pinched his brow. "Fine. We keep this between us, agreed?"</p>

<p>"Aye," Aiman said. He muttered a quick prayer.</p>

<p>"Agreed," Karrak said.</p>

<p>Ehsan said nothing but nodded.</p>

<p>"Good," Farid said. It was far from good, but it was enough.</p>

<p>As they crawled, silent and burdened, through the cold mud back to their trench, Farid wrestled with hope. What other choice do the disposable people of the world have? The men above them had weapons, gold, blessings from the gods—all that Farid had was his body. All he could do was refuse to be ink and try to save the ones that could still be pulled out from the night.</p>

<p>The order to attack came two days later.</p>

<hr />
<p>The officer's whistles thrust the cold morning into blinkered clarity. One purpose now: survive and advance. Farid flinched as another barrage of energy beams and shells rumbled overhead, whistling and screaming through the sky. The earth shook, his heart pounded against his cuirass.</p>

<p>The first wave had already gone over the top, only a handful from Farid's section tumbling back into the trench, feathered with bolts. The second wave stood ready on the fire step; Farid, Karrak, Aiman, and Ehsan stood in the final wave of the day, shoulder to shoulder with the other soldiers of D Company, Third Tomakul Spears. Stinking fear and shallow breath fogged the air above them. Someone retched, as someone always does. Farid's leg could not stop shaking.</p>

<p>A sound like thunder rumbled overhead, constant and bone-rattling. Heavy bomb-lobbers, catapulting shells overhead from somewhere well behind the line. Farid had seen those machines before: they looked to him like beetles with smokestacks bristling from their backs—cannons, the engineers and artificers called them. They had been firing for the better part of an hour now, pounding the Argivian line with explosions and shrapnel. Acrid smoke drifted back. Though he could not see from inside the trench, Farid could smell the raging, terrible fire. They would continue that bombardment until the first wave was nearly upon the Argivian lines.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align:right;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/IRQ94zAKWf.jpg" /><p class="embedImageCaption">Art by: <a href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&amp;output=spoiler&amp;method=visual&amp;artist=+[%22Campbell%20White%22]" target="_blank">Campbell White</a></p></div></div>

<p>An officer stood directly behind Farid, sword drawn, and bellowed about glory and honor and driving the Argivian dogs back to the Mardun. He promised the first soldier of his company to reach the Argivian trench a sack of gold coins, a commendation to any who captured an Argivian flag. If any cowards remained behind, he promised to have them taste Tomakul steel.</p>

<p>D Company's lives were packed onto their backs. If this attack was successful—which the officers demanded and assured them it would be—then they would move into the cleared-out trench. If they died, then it was easy for the quartermasters and supply officers to collect. D Company wore their coats, their long knives, brass caps if they had them or soft campaign covers if they did not. They carried their short spears and bandoliers of extra bomb-tipped heads, clubs, trench nails. Anything to make them better killers.</p>

<p>The bomb-lobbers fell silent, the last reports of shells echoing away down the valley.</p>

<p>Another whistle. The barking of sergeants and hollering of officers drove the second wave up from the fire step, up over the ladders, up over the lip of the trench and into the swirling smoke. No land beyond the lip of the trench, Farid thought as he stepped up to the fire step. He cheered along with the rest of the men, cheered until his throat hurt so the officers would not turn on him. Aiman bellowed, Ehsan's voice cracked and wobbled. Karrak cursed over and over.</p>

<p>They were next.</p>

<p>"What do we do?" Ehsan looked up at Farid, clutching his spear in a white-knuckled grip.</p>

<p>"We go slow," Farid whispered. It wasn't safe to talk here. "Stay with me. Be my shadow. Don't go anywhere I don't go. If I die, look for Karrak or Aiman." Farid looked down at Ehsan. "If you can't find any of us, get down and stay down until night. Don't fight, just stay alive."</p>

<p>Ehsan nodded. He shuffled closer to Farid, who put an arm around his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Ready up, spearman!" The officer behind them shouted, slapping Farid's arm with the flat of his sword. Farid cursed and removed his arm from Ehsan's shoulder.</p>

<p>Shouts up and down the line. Runners hurrying with last-second orders. Officers clenched whistles between their teeth but did not blow, reading the small scrolls.</p>

<p>The wind changed. The rotten stink of decay washed over the trench from behind as the officers shouted at their soldiers to pull up their masks. Farid and the rest of the company tugged their muslin masks from their pouches and tied them on. The fabric was soft and did little to banish the eye-watering stink of the transmogrants. Freed of their chains, they trod in shuffling lockstep over narrow plank bridges laid across the trench. But for the sound of their bare flesh-and-metal feet thudding on the wood or squelching in the cold mud, they were quiet.</p>

<p>Farid, thankfully, was not under one of the bridges. He hazarded a look over to the nearest crossing and watched in horror as the transmogrants advanced; though mass-produced in some charnel factory, each one seemed a unique body, a one-off marriage of dead flesh and iron. They were each a nightmare.</p>

<p>Farid tugged his cloth mask tighter and set his eyes straight to the ladder in front of him. When the whistle blew, he climbed, pushed along by those behind him. Near the top of the ladder, he reached up and took Karrak's hand, pulling himself up over the lip of the trench. He turned and helped Ehsan up, and then left the officer behind to fend for himself.</p>

<div class="embedImageWrapper" style="text-align:right;"><div class="embedImagePositioner"><img class="embedImage" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/QC9b36B3Z3.jpg" /><p class="embedImageCaption">Art by: <a href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&amp;output=spoiler&amp;method=visual&amp;artist=+[%22Daarken%22]" target="_blank">Daarken</a></p></div></div>

<p>The charge was slow despite the screaming of the officers' whistles and hoarse cry from the third wave. Smoke drifted over everything, shrinking their world down to a hazy ring a dozen yards in diameter. Farid, Aiman, Karrak, and Ehsan moved slowly forward, spears level, spaced only a few feet apart, marching rather than running toward the Argivian line. A dozen or so spearmen walked in rank alongside them, vanishing into the smoke on either side. An officer walked behind them, sword drawn.</p>

<p>"Steady boys," Farid said. "Steady. Watch your footing." A hot rain fell, mud and water tumbling down from the morning's mighty bombardment. Here and there, they came across the fallen bodies of their comrades, torn and burned. Casualties of the shells that missed their mark and fell among their own ranks.</p>

<p>The charge across no-man's-land was a slow tumbling of balance and recovery. They slipped and slid across muddy craters and used their spears as walking sticks. Shouts rang up and down the line, drifting in from the smoke along the advance. Together they crossed the crater field and passed by the ruined ornithopter. Ahead it was quiet, without the usual sound of battle. No cries of pain or fear, no shouts, no clash of metal on metal, no great booms and reports of bombs or the massive weapons of the machines. Just the crackle of fire, the soft rattling of their equipment, and the quiet encouragement of the officers behind.</p>

<p>They reached the Argivian trench and found it empty. Their bombardment had been effective and terrible, churning the well-engineered battlements into a mess of wire, burning wood, and abandoned equipment. Some lightly wounded Fallaji soldiers of the first and second wave sat smoking or resting on captured crates of Argivian equipment. They greeted the third wave with exhausted nods and sardonic cheers.</p>

<p>"Where are the Argivians?" a lieutenant screamed at the wounded soldiers. "Where is the enemy?"</p>

<p>"Front's moved," a wounded corporal said. She thumbed over her shoulder, down the valley toward the distant Mardun. "Rest of the Third went on to the next trench. Looks like the Argivians are running back to Kroog."</p>

<p>The officer stamped and fumed, then ordered D Company to check the trench while he went to find out what he should do. Farid, Karrak, Aiman, and Ehsan went together, the four of them wandering off into a section of the trench that was largely intact.</p>

<p>They found it to be a mirror of their own. Dugouts and small chambers for soldiers to crouch and sleep in. Empty racks where they would have kept weapons stowed for quick access should an attack come. Plenty of small things left behind in the hurry to escape. Not a single soul remained. Farid and Ehsan found a transmogrant that had tumbled into the trench and snapped in half. Farid stabbed it with his spear, thinking to put the beast out of its misery, but it only grabbed the weapon and turned its eyeless gaze to him. Farid released his spear and staggered back. The transmogrant shuddered, as if trying to stand, but made no sound. Aiman pulled Ehsan from the transmogrant, wordlessly steering him away before the boy could try to use his own spear on the fallen creature.</p>

<p>"Hey, Farid," Karrak called. He stood halfway in a dugout, spear tucked under his arm. "Look what I found." He held up a small packet of paper wrapping, secured with a shred of familiar fabric. Farid walked over and saw it was a strip of Fallaji silk–one of the sashes they'd traded with Laria and her soldiers.</p>

<p>"What is it?" Farid asked.</p>

<p>"No clue." Karrak said, offering it to him.</p>

<p>Farid took the packet. For a moment, he worried it was a trap, but that moment passed. Karrak, Aiman, and Ehsan crowded him, curious. Farid tugged the silk free, stuffed it in his pocket, and unwrapped the contents, revealing a small piece of chocolate and a note.</p>

<p><em>Our gratitude</em>, written in Fallaji script by an Argivian hand.</p>

<p>Farid smiled. A small and human thing. Ink, blotting the page.</p>

<p>The officers' whistles started up again. Forward, the order.</p>

<p>Eleven miles from the golden domes of Tomakul, the front was on the move once more.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>44 AR</strong></p>

<p>Teferi appeared at night in a place very much like hell. Fire burned low on all sides of the spot where he snapped into coherence. He was grateful that as a spirit he could not smell what he saw: The dead were so closely packed that in some places there was no visible ground, only bodies atop bodies. Ruined machines ticked and cooled. Earthworks, once mighty testaments to engineering and human brilliance, were empty and abandoned. A battlefield at night, after some bloody price paid. Teferi looked around, grim-faced, and tried to get his bearings; the last two jumps had rattled him.</p>

<p>The Last Battle took place on Argoth, an island shattered and buried by the sylex blast. Histories recorded by survivors elsewhere on Terisiare spoke of it as a verdant jewel, the last green place where the brothers fought. This place was not that. A bit of wall stood alone in a valley stripped of trees and greenery, boiled to mud and crisscrossed by wire-bordered trenches. Fires burned on what surface it could eat. Not Argoth; likely somewhere on the mainland.</p>

<p>The knot of time around the Last Battle was a confusing morass of recursive loops, potentialities, and branching paths. Navigating them, even with the aid of Saheeli's brilliant Temporal Anchor, was a nightmare. Or Teferi thought it was, until he realigned here on this battlefield. This was the true nightmare. Worse even than the burning streets of Kroog. He'd returned shaken from that experience, but time—even for him, and even with the anchor at his disposal—was running out. He had to return, quickly.</p>

<p>Teferi guessed and, against Kaya and Saheeli's protestations, had engaged the anchor once more, seeking the Last Battle in the manifold mess of time that was the Brothers' War. On paper his search was simple enough: find what he came to think of as "blotted time," where tens of thousands of lives met and came to an end. Blotted time looked to Teferi like holes chewed in a hanging curtain, or stars in the night sky. Its cause was great death—the infinite possibilities of all those lives ending in a moment, taking with them a piece of the great tapestry of time.</p>

<p>Time was running out; the moment Teferi sought was difficult to find. He was only one observer; he was not a god. All other possibilities were slipping away from him.</p>

<p>What did he know of the Last Battle? Urza brought a colossus of stone and iron, and it fought a titan of wood and resin and the dead of Argoth. Then Urza and the sylex killed the world.</p>

<p>Teferi glided over the ground, giving himself a few minutes before heading back and trying again. He didn't see a stone colossus or a titanic forest creature, like Kayla's poem mentioned. There was no ocean. Only mud and the dead.</p>

<p>And the scavengers.</p>

<p>Teferi didn't see them when he first arrived, but he saw them now. Lone figures stalked across the field, bending every now and then to examine a body. Alone or in small groups, they dragged bodies behind them, stacking them on carts that others wheeled off into the night. Some collected the ruined parts of fallen automatons, prying powerstones from sockets and working joints from shattered bodies.</p>

<p>"Who are you?"</p>

<p>If Teferi had blood, it would have run cold. He turned, slowly, and looked into the hideously augmented face of one of the black-robed scavengers.</p>

<p>"Are you the one from our dream?" the person whispered. They stepped forward, a deep whirring and clicking issuing from them. Their eyes were black chips of glass set deep into puffy, red sockets. Their mouth was lipless, toothless, replaced with a studded, tumbling cylinder that clicked thin metal strips as it turned. The sound was flat, soft, and hideous.</p>

<p>They did not seem to be in pain. Instead, it looked as if they were smiling.</p>

<p>Teferi drifted backwards, avoiding the scavenger as they reached toward him. The hem of their sleeve fell away, revealing an arm that ended in a cluster of dozens of small grasping manipulators.</p>

<p>"Brothers," the scavenger screamed. "Do you see him?"</p>

<p>Teferi had seen enough. This was not the Last Battle, only a footnote lost in the great void on time's tapestry that was the Brothers' War.</p>

<p>It was time to go.</p>

As many fans noted during preview events held at Wizards Play Network stores around the world, some small number of <em>Dominaria Remastered</em> Draft Boosters contained a bit of Phyrexia—namely, rare cards from the upcoming <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/products/phyrexia-all-will-be-one" target="_blank"><em>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</em></a> set.</p>

<p>While terribly on-brand for Phyrexia, we also know it was unexpected for fans. If anyone who purchased <em>Dominaria Remastered</em> Draft Boosters is unsatisfied with their purchase due to the presence of future Phyrexian nonsense, you <a href="https://support.wizards.com/hc/en-us/requests/new" target="_blank">can contact Customer Support here.</a></p>

<p>In the meantime, like the brave Mirrans who stand in their way, we also won't be bowing down to this Phyrexian invasion. The debut for <em>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</em> airs next week on January 17 beginning at 9 a.m. PT (12 p.m. ET) at <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/magic" target="_blank">twitch.tv/magic</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@mtg" target="_blank">the official <em>Magic </em>YouTube channel</a>, and preview season will go on after that. While rare card images are out there for those who want to find them, we're choosing to preserve the preview experience for this highly anticipated return to New Phyrexia. Plus, the Booster Fun variants for these cards have yet to be revealed and are amazing pieces of art.</p>

<p>So, tune in on January 17 as we kick off all the previews for <em>Phyrexia: All Will Be One</em>, for real this time. In the meantime, we'll do what we can to hold back the tide of yet another Phyrexian invasion.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Trivial Pursuit: What's in a Name?</title><link>https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/making-magic/trivial-pursuit-whats-in-a-name</link><guid>https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/making-magic/trivial-pursuit-whats-in-a-name</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>Today's article is a trivia column about card names. For each question, I will ask about how a card was named and then give you four cards to choose from. I will then give the answer (which you must click to reveal).</p>

<p><strong>Question #1 – Which of the following cards was named after someone who would go on to become head designer?</strong></p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
	<li><auto-card mvid="4604">Emmessi Tome</auto-card></li>
	<li><auto-card mvid="1010">Jalum Tome</auto-card></li>
	<li><auto-card mvid="25">Jayemdae Tome</auto-card></li>

	<div>&nbsp;
	<p><strong>Answer: b. Jalum Tome</strong></p>

	<p>When Richard was making <em>Alpha</em>, he named several cards after friends of his. One such card was <auto-card mvid="25">Jayemdae Tome</auto-card> or J.M.D. Tome. The J.M.D. stood for James Michael Davis. Mike Davis was the person who accompanied Richard to the very first meeting they had with Wizards of the Coast, at the time trying to sell Richard's game <em>Roborally</em>. Peter Adkison, the CEO of Wizards, informed them that the game had too many components for a company their size to produce, but said they did have the ability to print cards with art on them. This story has a happy ending.</p>

	<p>The tradition of naming Tomes after the initials of designers continued. <auto-card mvid="1010">Jalum Tome</auto-card> or J.L.M. Tome was named after Joel L. Mick, one of the designers of<em> Antiquities</em>. Joel would later become the first head designer for <em>Magic</em> (followed by Bill Rose, followed by me).</p>

	<p><auto-card mvid="4604">Emmessi Tome</auto-card> or M.S.E. Tome was named after Mike Scott Elliott, a designer on <em>Tempest</em>. Mike would go on to be a very prolific <em>Magic</em> designer, leading more set designs than anyone save myself.</p>

	<p><auto-card mvid="3257">Mangara's Tome</auto-card> is the only one not named after a designer. Mangara is an anagram of the word "anagram." The designers who named it (back then, the designers did most of the naming for their own set) thought it was a funny poke at how often we used anagrams for card names back in the day. (You'll get a sense of this today as anagrams come up a lot.)</p>

<p><strong>Question #2 – Which of the following characters got their name through the following process: We took an English word starting with C, changed the C to a K, and removed an "i" from the word to make the name? (The word is loosely thematically relevant to the character.)</strong></p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
	<li><auto-card mvid="470591">Kadena, Slinking Sorcerer </auto-card></li>
	<li><auto-card mvid="417756">Kambal, Consul of Allocation</auto-card></li>
	<li><auto-card mvid="9847">Karn, Silver Golem</auto-card></li>
	<li><auto-card mvid="44263">Karona, False God</auto-card></li>
</ol>

	<div>&nbsp;
	<p><strong>Answer: c. Karn, Silver Golem</strong></p>

	<p>Karn is named after the word "cairn." It is defined as a "heap of stones piled as a memorial or a landmark." Karn was a golem that held the Legacy, a collection of important artifacts, so we thought it was neat to name him after a landmark made of stones. He was named, interestingly, before we had decided what material he was made from.</p>

<p><strong>Question #3 – Which of the following <em>Antiquities</em> cards was named after a card from <em>Alpha</em>?</strong></p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
	<li><auto-card mvid="992">Amulet of Kroog</auto-card></li>
	<li><auto-card mvid="1003">Coral Helm</auto-card></li>
	<li><auto-card mvid="1015">Onulet </auto-card></li>

	<div class="wrapper">
	<div>&nbsp;
	<p><strong>Answer: c. Onulet</strong></p>

	<p><auto-card mvid="1015">Onulet</auto-card> was originally Onulets, and it was an anagram of the <em>Alpha</em> card <auto-card mvid="41">Soul Net</auto-card>, which also gives you life when a creature dies. When the art came back for Onulets, there was only one creature pictured in the art, so they had to change the name. They thought about giving it a brand-new name, but they'd grown to like the name Onulet, so they just made it singular, thus ruining the anagram.</p>

<p><strong>Question #4 – Which legendary creature from <em>Mirage</em> has a name that was somewhat inspired by a football player? (I am referring to American football.)</strong></p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
	<li><auto-card mvid="3527">Asmira, Holy Avenger</auto-card></li>

	<div class="wrapper">
	<div>&nbsp;
	<p><strong>Answer: d. Telim'Tor</strong></p>

	<p>The design team of <em>Mirage</em> consisted of six people who had all been <em>Alpha</em> playtesters who Richard met through a bridge club (Bill Rose, Charlie Catino, Don Felice, Elliott Segal, Howard Kahlenberg, and Joel Mick). That group would go on to design <em>Mirage</em> and <em>Visions</em>. One day while the group was playtesting, Elliott talked about how he thought it was cool that Chicago Bears player William Perry had the nickname of "the Refrigerator." He suggested it might be cool if the members of the design team each got a nickname, to which Bill Rose replied, "Okay, Mr. Toilet." Telim'Tor is an anagram of "Mr. Toilet."</p>

	<div>&nbsp;
	<p><strong>Answer: d. Spark Fiend</strong></p>

	<p>The mechanics of <auto-card mvid="9754">Spark Fiend</auto-card> are based on the dice game Craps. Spark is Kraps spelled backwards. The very first name was actually Sparc Elemental, but all it did was create notes in the database that we misspelled it, so we changed it to Spark.</p>

<p><strong>Question #6 – Which card from <em>Odyssey</em> has a name that is the combination of the names of two older cards?</strong></p>

	<li><auto-card mvid="29914">Cantivore</auto-card></li>

	<dd>
	<div class="wrapper">
	<div>&nbsp;
	<p><strong>Answer: d. Syncopate</strong></p>

	<p>One of the big challenges in naming <em>Magic</em> cards is coming up with cool new words for counterspells. Because every set has multiples, we long ago chewed through all the obvious low-hanging names. Syncopate is a musical term that means "to displace the beats or accents in music so that strong beats become weak and weak beats become strong," so it was a cool counterspell name as it implies the messing with how something works.</p>

	<p>The even cooler part, though, is the design that combines taxing (for X) with an exiling of the countered card. The original spell that taxed the opponent (for X) and then countered the spell if they couldn't pay the tax was <auto-card mvid="120">Power Sink</auto-card> in <em>Alpha</em>. The first counterspell that exiled a spell it countered was <auto-card mvid="3332">Dissipate</auto-card> from <em>Mirage</em>. This card was originally designed because we realized that we could take the "Sink" from <auto-card mvid="120">Power Sink</auto-card> and combine it with the "pate" from <auto-card mvid="3332">Dissipate</auto-card> to make the word Syncopate. The whole package was so awesome, it went into <em>Odyssey</em> in early design and stayed to print.</p>

	<div>&nbsp;
	<p><strong>Answer: c. Mijae Djinn</strong></p>

	<p><auto-card mvid="945">Ernham Djinn</auto-card> was named after Herman, Richard's brother-in-law. Ernham is an anagram of Herman. <auto-card mvid="947">Ifh-Biff Efreet</auto-card> was named after Elizabeth, Richard's sister. Richard couldn't say "Elizabeth" when he was little, so he called her "Ifh-Biff" and the name stuck as a nickname.</p>

	<p><auto-card mvid="3227">Phelddagrif</auto-card> is an anagram of "Garfield Ph.D." The name was an inside joke in R&amp;D because they liked to tease him that the PR always referred to him as that in interviews.</p>

	<p><auto-card mvid="964">Mijae Djinn</auto-card> was named after a friend of Richard's named Jamie, who had gotten married to another friend Wendy, around the time of <em>Arabian Nights</em>. Richard was the best man at the wedding. Mijae is an anagram of Jamie. Ydwen, of Ydwen Efreet, is anagram of Wendy. Jamie is not related to Richard.</p>

	<div>&nbsp;
	<p><strong>Answer: b. Alchor's Tomb</strong></p>

	<p>Peter played a powerful wizard named Alchor. As a tribute to him, the <em>Legends</em> design team made a card called Alchor's Tome to reference an artifact for a wizard. The artist unfortunately misheard what was being asked and instead of drawing a tome, he drew a tomb. There was a tight enough turnaround that they couldn't get new art, so the card name changed. Peter's playful response was "This is how you honor my character, by killing him?"</p>

	<p>Vhati was short for "Bogavhati," the codename for <em>Tempest</em>.

The plane's name was changed to Eldraine, but the Creative team really liked the name Ardenvale, so they made it the name of the white kingdom.</p>

	<p><strong>Answer: a. Dralnu, Lich Lord</strong></p>

	<p>Dralnu first appeared in the flavor text of a <em>Planeshift </em>card. He was accredited as Lord Dralnu. The others (Endrek in <em>Fallen Empires</em>, Ib Halfheart and Jaya Ballard in <em>Ice Age</em>) all used the attribute in their name originally in flavor text. Jaya Ballard got her last name, interestingly from editor Darla Kennerud, after a city in greater Seattle.</p>

<p><strong>Question #17 – Which of the following cards from <em>Apocalypse</em> had to have their name changed at the absolute last minute before printing because it implied an ability the creature didn't have?</strong></p>

	<p><strong>Answer: d. Spectral Lynx</strong></p>

	<p>Here's the story. When the set <em>Apocalypse</em> was close to being finished, the last member of the Creative team quit (it was a much smaller team back then). Bill Rose came to me and asked if I would be willing to take charge of names and flavor text until they hired some new people to be on the Creative team. I'd overseen the names and flavor text for <em>Unglued</em> (and had done a lot of name/flavor text writing), so I was the one person in R&amp;D who had done the job before. My first task in this role was to look at the <em>Apocalypse</em> names before the set went to print. Only one name seemed problematic to me.</p>

	<p><auto-card mvid="26663">Spectral Lynx</auto-card> was at the time called Spirit Lynx. This was before <em>Future Sight</em> where we introduced the keyword lifelink. Before that, it was colloquially referred to as "spirit link" as that was the card, from <em>Legends</em>, that had made the ability popular (although, for the record, the effect on <auto-card>Spirit Link</auto-card> isn't exactly lifelink). I said a creature couldn't be called Spirt Lynx if it didn't have the ability players referred to, at the time, as "spirit link," so it had to change. Because it was so late in the process, the collector numbers had already been locked in, so we had to come up with a name in between <auto-card mvid="27674">Shield of Duty and Reason</auto-card> and <auto-card mvid="26783">Standard Bearer</auto-card>. <auto-card mvid="26663">Spectral Lynx</auto-card> was our best answer.</p>

	<p><strong>Answer: b. Elkin Bottle</strong></p>

	<p>The bottle pictured in the art is what is known as a Klein bottle. A Klein bottle is an example of a non-orientable surface studied in topology (a branch of mathematics). It's named after the mathematician Felix Klein who first described it. Another non-orientable object, a Möbius strip, got a similar treatment on the card <auto-card mvid="4429">Bosium Strip</auto-card> in <em>Weatherlight</em>.</p>

	<p><strong>Answer: a. Pemmin's Aura</strong></p>

	<p><auto-card mvid="43581">Pemmin's Aura</auto-card> is an anagram of "I am Superman."

The official rules are still under review at the time of this writing. When they are published, they can be found on our <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/gameplay/rules-and-formats/rules" target="_blank">rules page</a>. If there should be a discrepancy between this summary and the official rules, the official rules take precedence.</p>

<h1>New and Updated Rules</h1>

<h2>Connive</h2>

<h2>701.47</h2>

<p>The first subrule in this section explains the connive keyword action. Specifically, if a creature is instructed to connive, its controller draws a card, then discards a card. If a nonland permanent is discarded this way, that player puts a +1/+1 counter on the conniving permanent.</p>

<p>The rest of this section covers fewer common cases, like what happens when a permanent that changed zones is instructed to connive or what happens when multiple permanents are instructed to connive at the same time. They also explain how the connive N variant works.</p>

<h2>Casualty</h2>

<h2>702.153</h2>

<p>This is the entry for casualty. Casualty N means "As an additional cost to cast this spell, you may sacrifice a creature with power N or greater," and "When you cast this spell, if a casualty cost was paid for it, copy it. If the spell has any targets, you may choose new targets for the copy."</p>

<p>A second subrule explains that if a spell has multiple instances of casualty, they are each paid separately and each trigger based on the payments made for it.</p>

<h2>Blitz</h2>

<h2>702.152</h2>

<p>This is the rule that defines the blitz keyword ability. Blitz represents two static abilities that function while the card with blitz is on the stack and a static ability that functions while the object with blitz is on the battlefield. "Blitz [cost]" means "You may cast this card by paying [cost] rather than its mana cost," "If this spell's blitz cost was paid, sacrifice the permanent this spell becomes at the beginning of the next end step," and "As long as this permanent's blitz cost was paid, it has haste and 'When this permanent is put into a graveyard from the battlefield, draw a card.'" Casting a spell for its blitz cost follows the rules for paying alternative costs in rules 601.2b and 601.2f–h.</p>

<h2>Shield Counters</h2>

<h2>122.1c</h2>

<p>This new rule in the section about counters explains the replacement effects that affect permanents with one or more shield counters. Specifically, these are "If this permanent would be destroyed as the result of an effect, instead remove a shield counter from it" and "If damage would be dealt to this permanent, prevent that damage and remove a shield counter from it."</p>

<h2>Equip Planeswalker</h2>

<h2>702.6e</h2>

<p>This new rule explains how the equip planeswalker variant ability works. "Equip planeswalker [cost]" means "[Cost]: Attach this permanent to target planeswalker you control as though that planeswalker were a creature. Activate only any time you could cast a sorcery."</p>

<h2>Hideaway</h2>

<h2>702.75a-b</h2>

<p>Hideaway has been updated with the release of <em>Streets of New Capenna</em>. 702.75a now contains the new definition of hideaway, and 702.75b makes the errata to older cards that goes along with it explicitly clear. With this change, "Hideaway N" means "When this permanent enters the battlefield, look at the top N cards of your library. Exile one of them face down and put the rest on the bottom of your library in a random order. The exiled card gains 'The player who controls the permanent that exiled this card may look at this card in the exile zone.'"</p>

<h2>Interchangeable Names and Alternate Names</h2>

<p>With the addition of the in-universe counterparts to the <em>Secret Lair x Stranger Things</em> cards, several rules have been added or updated to address how to handle cards with different English names that are treated as though they have the same name.</p>

<h2>201.3</h2>

<p>The current 201.3 and the rest of the name section get bumped down to make room for this new section about interchangeable card names. The upshot is that for all deck construction, format legality, and game rules purposes, cards with interchangeable names are considered to have the same name.</p>

<h2>201.4g</h2>

<p>This new subrule explains what happens if a player is instructed to choose a card name and chooses the name of a card with interchangeable names. In that case, the name of each of the appropriate cards has been chosen.</p>

<h2>201.6</h2>

<p>This is the rule that handles alternate names, which are found on some cards with a secondary title bar like <auto-card>Zilortha, Strength Incarnate</auto-card>. Moving forward, these cards may reference their secondary name line in rules text, and this rule has been updated to cover that. Notably, these are not the same as interchangeable names, and these cards are still always considered to have the name in their secondary title bar. The official Oracle text of these cards will continue to reference that name.</p>

<h2>212.1f</h2>

<p>This new rule explains that the indicator that appears below the text box on certain cards with interchangeable names refers to a specific version of that card.</p>

<p>Several rules in various format sections have also been updated to explain that, for the purposes of deck construction, cards with these interchangeable names have the same name.</p>

<h2>Other rules changes</h2>

<h2>207.2c</h2>

<p>Alliance joins the list of ability words.</p>

<h2>208.4a-b</h2>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Bess, Soul Nourisher" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/ncc/en_MYDTBLc1D5.png" /></p>

<p>This is the rule that defines what "base power and toughness" means. Bess, Soul Nourisher uses it in a new way, so the original definition became subrule 208.4a and the new subrule 208.4b now explains how to calculate the current base power and/or toughness of a creature. Paraphrasing the rule, an effect that needs to know the base power and/or toughness of a creature sees that permanent's characteristics after characteristic-defining abilities and abilities that set power and/or toughness and ignore any effects and counters that modify power and/or toughness without setting them.</p>

<p>So, for example, if you control a creature with the ability "This creature's power and toughness are each equal to the number of lands you control" and have cast <auto-card>Titanic Growth</auto-card> on it, the base power and toughness is equal to the number of lands you control, not counting the bonus from <auto-card>Titanic Growth</auto-card>'s effect.</p>

<h2>601.4a</h2>

<p>This new rule explains what happens in the very rare case that a spell loses flash during the spell-casting process. If that happens, the player may finish casting the spell as though it had flash.</p>

<h2>612.7</h2>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Witness Protection" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/snc/en_9A9vG82dWq.png" /></p>

<p>This rule used to refer explicitly to the card <auto-card>Awakening of Vitu-Ghazi</auto-card>, but now Witness Protection does the same thing, so this rule has been generalized. This is not a functional change to either card.</p>

<h2>702.124g</h2>

<p>This new partner subrule explains how the friends forever partner variant works. Notably, it does not interact with any other partner ability.</p>

<h2>702.138c-d</h2>

<p>Some cards with the escape ability say "[This permanent] escapes with [something]." Sometimes the "something" is a replacement effect that changes how it enters the battlefield, and sometimes its an ability that the permanent has. A new subrule disambiguates these cases.</p>

<h2>New Subtypes</h2>

<p>Raccoon</p>

<h2>New Glossary Entries</h2>

<p>Blitz, casualty, connive, friends forever, shield counter</p>

<p><strong>Standard</strong>:</p>

<p>No changes</p>

<p>We've been carefully monitoring the Standard metagame since the format rotation and release of <em>Innistrad: Midnight Hunt</em>. As <em>Innistrad: Midnight Hunt</em>'s Standard season winds down and we approach the release of <em>Innistrad: Crimson Vow</em> next month, we've been aware of some players' concerns about the impact of certain individual cards on metagame diversity, such as <auto-card>Alrund's Epiphany</auto-card> and <auto-card>Esika's Chariot</auto-card>. After reviewing <em>MTG Arena</em> metagame data and recent online events (including the World Championship), and in considering the upcoming release of <em>Innistrad: Crimson Vow</em>, we've decided not to make any changes at this time.</p>

<p>We'll consider changes to the Standard environment, if necessary, after evaluating <em>Innistrad: Crimson Vow</em>'s impact on the metagame.</p>

<p><strong>Historic</strong>:</p>

<p><auto-card>Tibalt's Trickery</auto-card> is banned in Historic.</p>

<p><auto-card>Memory Lapse</auto-card> is suspended in Historic.</p>

<p><auto-card>Brainstorm</auto-card> is banned in Historic (from suspended).</p>

<p>Five digital-only cards are being rebalanced:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Davriel's Withering and Davriel, Soul Broker's third ability now only affect "target creature an opponent controls."</li>
    <li>Faceless Agent is now 2/2 (from 2/1).</li>
    <li>Sarkhan, Wanderer to Shiv's second ability is now +1 (from +0).</li>
    <li>Subversive Acolyte now costs 1B (from BB), is 2/3 (from 2/2), and had the toughness increases from becoming Human or Phyrexian reduced by 1.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>MTG Arena</em> effective date</strong>: October 14, 2021</p>

<p><em>Jumpstart: Historic Horizons</em> created a large amount of change in the Historic Metagame, and most of it looks very positive. But after watching initial reception, September's Historic Arena Open, and the response of the broader metagame to the Arena Open, there are a couple adjustments we feel the Historic format needs.</p>

<p>In addition to the normal bans and suspensions, the digital-only cards in <em>Jumpstart: Historic Horizons</em> give us a chance to return to a balance tool we haven't used in <em>Magic</em> for many years: functional rebalancing for cards. More on that below.</p>

<h1>Bans and Suspensions</h1>

<p>On the broader Historic metagame front, one of the big changes is the return of decks built around <auto-card>Tibalt's Trickery</auto-card>, now using <auto-card>Throes of Chaos</auto-card> to boost the hit rate on the combo dramatically. This has led to a marked increase in win rate for the deck relative to the prior version and a corresponding increase in popularity. The prior, less consistent version of this deck was borderline, and the increased hit rate in this version has pushed it over the line. Because we think it is unlikely for Historic to be able to safely include a combo of this speed and consistency, <auto-card>Tibalt's Trickery</auto-card> is banned in Historic.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/july-21-2021-banned-and-restricted-announcement" target="_blank">Banned and Restricted Announcements earlier this year</a>, we have talked about the dominance of blue and red decks. Our past changes, along with the additions from <em>Jumpstart: Historic Horizons</em>, have done good work in addressing this, but we still see a slight issue here.</p>

<p>Looking at high-level play and the Arena Open in particular, <auto-card>Memory Lapse</auto-card> emerged as nearly a must-include in high-performing blue decks. It was the most played nonland card in the Arena Open as well as the Best-of-Three ladder, and it is one of the most played cards in Best-of-One as well. While we do believe that removing <auto-card>Memory Lapse</auto-card> from the format is likely to create further improvements in format diversity, we also believe the case is less clear than <auto-card>Tibalt's Trickery</auto-card>. As such, and in order to increase format diversity, <auto-card>Memory Lapse</auto-card> is suspended in Historic.</p>

<p>Rounding out the bans and suspensions, <auto-card>Brainstorm</auto-card> is currently suspended in Historic, and this has helped in shifting the metagame in a healthier direction. Because this suspension has proved positive, <auto-card>Brainstorm</auto-card> is banned in Historic.</p>

<h1>Rebalanced Cards</h1>

<p>In addition to these bans and suspensions, we are also rebalancing five cards with this announcement. Digital-only cards in digital-only formats like Historic give us the ability to functionally rebalance cards simply and clearly. We can simply update the text digitally, and the cards will remain accurate to their new function.</p>

<p>Functional rebalancing is a significant change in how we're managing balance for our formats, and it merits a bit of explanation around what it does and doesn't mean. Going forward, we will be managing formats on <em>MTG Arena</em> in two different ways. "Print" formats, like Standard, will continue to work exactly like they do in tabletop <em>Magic</em>. For "Live" formats, like Historic, we are adding live balancing alongside banning and suspension as a tool to address problems and make improvements to the format.</p>

<p>We are very aware that there are many <em>MTG Arena</em> players who want the game to be an authentic representation of tabletop <em>Magic</em>, and our "print" formats will remain exactly that. Here, a card will always work the same way that the printed version of the card does and balance will be maintained the same way it traditionally has been: through banning cards when they prove to be problematic.</p>

<p>In addition to being an authentic version of tabletop <em>Magic</em>, <em>MTG Arena</em> is also a digital game. Digital games often make use of a wider array of balancing tools, like live rebalancing, and for good reason. The increased play rates and data collection possible in digital games tends to magnify the impact of power imbalances, which makes it valuable to have more tools to restore balance.</p>

<p>Currently, we are restricting these changes to digital-only cards, where there will be no conflict between a digital and printed version of a card. We would like to expand beyond this (for example, by rebalancing previously banned cards so they can be safely returned to play in digital formats only). There are multiple clarity and communication problems we will need to solve before we can consider those types of changes. This is something we plan to work on in the coming months and, since it bears repeating, would only affect digital formats.</p>

<p>One of the big themes of <em>Magic</em> over the last several years has been recognizing and embracing the many ways that <em>Magic</em> is played. On the tabletop side, we have released new content focused on Modern players, Commander players, collectors, and other groups. On <em>MTG Arena</em>, we recognize that we have traditional tabletop <em>Magic</em> fans and fans of digital games. With this shift, we aim to fully support both—continuing to deliver an authentic tabletop experience in formats like Standard and embracing new balance tools for digital-only formats like Historic.</p>

<h1>How Will Rebalanced Cards Work?</h1>

<p>Since these digital-only cards are only on <em>MTG Arena</em>, we can cleanly update all existing cards at once. With <em>MTG Arena</em>'s update on October 14, the text and stats on these cards will change to match their new values, exactly as if there had been an Oracle update. These changes will affect any format where these cards can be played (Historic, Historic Brawl, Direct Challenge, etc.). There will not be an in-game notification about the rebalancing, but that is something that we are working toward.</p>

<p>Much like with bans and suspensions, whenever we rebalance cards, we want to provide context around why we're making those changes. Read on for more info there from Donald Smith.</p>

<h1>Introduction to the Changes</h1>

<p>Hey, y'all. I'm Donald from the Play Design team. I've made a few appearances on the site talking about Challenger Decks, the genesis of <auto-card>Luminous Broodmoth</auto-card>'s design, and how powerful <auto-card>Wily Goblin</auto-card> was in my deck at the 2017 World Championships (it wasn't). Behind the scenes, I worked on <em>MTG Arena</em>'s Mirror Mirror event, and today, I'm here to give the rationale behind these rebalanced cards.</p>

<p>Like digital-only designs, live balancing is a new tool to maximize the potential of our digital formats. This first set of changes is not meant to significantly impact the metagame but improve the ladder experience. This will also give us a chance to collect feedback and data on how the environment reacts to these changes. While we will still ban and suspend cards, we will also look for opportunities to improve the competitive metagame and address other issues through live balancing.</p>

<p>The three buffs are aimed at popular cards that have room to be stronger to better serve the decks and roles they were designed for. The remaining two balance changes are not meant to reduce the playability of the cards, but to address an undesirable combo from Historic.</p>

<p>Faceless Agent is an important card for tribal decks that don't currently have the density of cards legal in Historic to fill out their curve. This is a simple buff to improve the experience of players using those tribal decks.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;"><strong>Sarkhan, Wanderer to Shiv</strong><br />

<p>Sarkhan's second ability is weaker than the other two, especially considering the tension between choosing to conjure <auto-card>Shivan Dragon</auto-card>s versus using the first ability to fuel future -2 abilities. We are aiming to better balance and reduce the tension between the abilities.</p>

<p>Subversive Acolyte competes too directly with <auto-card>Gifted Aetherborn</auto-card> for black decks looking for defensive options, and changing its mana cost adds a defensive option for black decks without needing to commit heavily into black to play <auto-card>Gifted Aetherborn</auto-card>. Adding a toughness lets Subversive Acolyte better fill that defensive role early in the game, and we adjusted the ability's stat boost to preserve the <auto-card>Phyrexian Negator</auto-card> reference.</p>

<h1>A Word from Art Director Stephanie Cheung</h1>

<p><em>"</em>Pride Across the Multiverse<em> is a celebration and reflection of how far we've come, what it took to get here, and what still lies ahead. From the start, we wanted this </em>Secret Lair<em> to celebrate the LGBTQIA2S+ community's relentless creativity. There was no way this collection of eight cards would represent EVERY aspect of the community, but we wanted to honor the hope and joy found in our multifaceted identities. It is our hope that people find some part of their own unique selves reflected in these cards. </em></p>

<p><em>"The team worked incredibly hard to depict characters from across the Multiverse on cards that represent everything from quiet mundane moments to big celebrations while recognizing the ongoing fight for our future. As art director, I wanted to celebrate the wide spectrum of identities and experiences by working with artists to express themselves with their style and unique experiences in these cards. This project was a terrific opportunity to bring in new styles and artists while also giving visibility to the folks who have been painting </em>Magic: The Gathering<em> for years! I looked for artists across the spectrum of LGBTQIA2S+ and BIPOC identities; having a breadth of artists is an important part of celebrating the diversity of our community and experiences. </em></p>

<p><em>"As a queer Asian American woman, working on this drop was deeply meaningful and a tremendous challenge. This was my first-ever art direction experience, and I am incredibly thankful for the mentorship of Jess Lanzillo and the support from Jontelle Leyson-Smith. I had the immense pleasure of working with an incredibly talented and playful group of people on this project. </em></p>

<p><em>"Each card in </em>Pride Across the Multiverse<em> tells its own story of love, struggle, resilience, joy, and community. Stories are how we practice hope, and I think it's so important to hope, to really be in the practice of holding fast and remaining true. It is our triumph, and we will shape the future with our ferocious resilience. I am so proud of what we were all able to accomplish in this set and thrilled to accompany you on this journey."</em></p>

<p><img style="magic" />It's Praetor Week, so today we'll take a look at these walking (or lurching, or skittering) symbols of power who rule the five factions of New Phyrexia. These are icons of Phyrexia viewed through the lenses of the five colors of mana, each one of them a representation of the dark principles and twisted philosophies of its faction.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Elesh Norn, Grand Cenobite</li>
</ul>
<img align="center" cap="" src="http://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/stf/stf137_grandCeno.jpg" />
<p align="right" class="small"><autocard>Elesh Norn, Grand Cenobite</autocard> | Illustration by <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoileramp;method=visualamp;action=advancedamp;artist=+[%22Igor Kieryluk%22]" type="newwindow">Igor Kieryluk</a></p>

<p><b>Role:</b> Elesh Norn is the praetor of the white-aligned Phyrexian faction, <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/stf/137">the Machine Orthodoxy</a>. She oversees all sects of the Machine Orthodoxy and commands great respect from all those who belong to the entire faction. She often goes by the title "Praetor of Unity."</p>

<p><b>Appearance:</b> Like many of her faction, Elesh Norn has no skin, but is outfitted with cracked, porcelain-like metal over her raw musculature. Her most recognizable characteristic is the set of broad blades of that bonelike metal that sweep back and away from her face. She often has lower-ranked cenobites and suture priests carrying her train and inscribing her utterances.</p>
<img align="center" cap="" src="http://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/stf/stf142_marrow.jpg" />
<p align="right" class="small"><autocard>Marrow Shards</autocard> | Illustration by <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoileramp;method=visualamp;action=advancedamp;artist=+[%22Raymond+Swanland%22]" type="newwindow">Raymond Swanland</a></p>

<p><b>Motif:</b><symbol id="space"><i>Indoctrinate</i>.</symbol></p>

<p><b>Agenda:</b> Elesh Norn rules over all the sects of the Machine Orthodoxy but abides by the particulars of none. She does believe, however, in the importance of unifying all of Phyrexia under a single banner by indoctrinating all life with Phyrexian beliefs. She sought to help induct Karn as the Father of Machines, but in her heart she believes that the Father of Machines is more of a symbolic figurehead than a true position of power, and she means to install a puppet in that role whom she can influence.</p>

<p><b>Trivia:</b><symbol id="space"><i>Cenobite</i> is an English word; it refers to a member of religious group who lives with others in a convent or community. The white-aligned Phyrexian faction, the Machine Orthodoxy, includes many cenobites as lesser priests and hierarchs, and the praetor Elesh Norn is the highest-ranking of such clergy—hence "Grand Cenobite."</symbol></p>

<ul>
    <li>Jin-Gitaxias, Core Augur</li>
</ul>
<img align="center" cap="" src="http://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/stf/stf138_art1.jpg" />
<p align="right" class="small"><autocard>Jin-Gitaxias, Core Augur</autocard> | Illustration by <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoileramp;method=visualamp;action=advancedamp;artist=+[%22Eric+Deschamps%22]" type="newwindow">Eric Deschamps</a></p>

<p><b>Role:</b> Jix-Gitaxias is the praetor of the blue-aligned Phyrexian faction, <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/stf/139">the Progress Engine</a>. He serves as the brilliant mastermind behind the sociopathic experiments of the so-called Great Synthesis.</p>

<p><b>Appearance:</b> Hunched and barbed, Jin-Gitaxias is covered in the chromelike metals common to Phyrexians of the Progress Engine. Jin-Gitaxias can communicate in a variety of modes and languages, including mental speech, which he uses to drill his ideals of perfection into the minds of others. As part of Jin-Gitaxias's optimized homeostasis, his ribs and spinal pillar flex and pulse disturbingly.</p>
<img align="center" cap="" src="http://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/stf/stf142_surgery.jpg" />
<p align="right" class="small"><autocard>Psychic Surgery</autocard> | Illustration by <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoileramp;method=visualamp;action=advancedamp;artist=+[%22Anthony+Francisco%22]" type="newwindow">Anthony Francisco</a></p>

<p><b>Motif:</b><symbol id="space"><i>Experiment</i>.</symbol></p>

<p><b>Agenda:</b> Jin-Gitaxias seeks the perfection of all life through the most perfect of methods: clinical experimentation. Of all the praetors, Jin-Gitaxias is the most concerned with converting the face of the world formerly known as Mirrodin to its Phyrexian ideal, from the smallest organism to the greatest sea. Jin-Gitaxias is a living storehouse of research data, collated from every tidbit of vicious exploration conducted throughout the plane.</p>

<p><b>Trivia:</b> Even though the five praetors weren't going to become cards until <i>New Phyrexia</i>, they were quoted in flavor text as early as <i>Scars of Mirrodin</i>. That meant we had to finalize what the praetors would be called in <i>New Phyrexia</i> the better part of a year before we would actually make cards for them. Some of the praetors' names were long and elaborate, though, and their mana costs were likely to run up into three or maybe four symbols. (For example, <manacost>8UU</manacost> takes three mana symbols to express, which can eat up space for longer names. <manacost>7UUU</manacost> would have taken four symbols and even more space.)</p>

<p>So we had to make sure that those names—including their including their postnominal epithets, such as "Core Augur"—would fit in the name bar of <b>Magic</b> cards. (Even then, their mana costs lost a colored mana during <i>New Phyrexia</i> development to make sure that the by-then-set-in-stone names would fit.) Jin-Gitaxias's initial name was the longest of the five—he was originally called "Jin-Gitaxias, the Augur of the Core." A bit of rearrangement and editing yielded the nicely efficient "Jin-Gitaxias, Core Augur." Note that "augur" here means "prognosticator" or "prophet." It doesn't mean "driller"—that's "auger," with an <i>e</i>. Handily for Phyrexia, Mirrodin's core came pre-drilled.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Sheoldred, Whispering One</li>
</ul>
<img align="center" cap="" src="http://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/stf/stf138_art15.jpg" />
<p align="right" class="small"><autocard>Sheoldred, Whispering One</autocard> | Illustration by <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoileramp;method=visualamp;action=advancedamp;artist=+[%22Jana+Voss%22]" type="newwindow">Jana Schirmer amp; Johannes Voss</a></p>

<p><b>Role:</b> Sheoldred is one of <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/stf/138">the seven Steel Thanes</a> that struggle for power over black-aligned faction of Phyrexia, and she currently holds the title of praetor.</p>

<p><b>Appearance:</b> Sheoldred appears as a feminine humanoid torso emerging from a huge-mouthed, many-jointed fiend. Her movements are spiderlike in their grace, her limbs finding purchase among the mycosynth and metallic structures of the Core. Her body is covered with plates of oily, corroded metal. Her voice is a soft, grinding whisper, and she is kept informed at all times by a constant stream of informants, spies, and underlings.</p>
<img align="center" cap="" src="http://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/stf/stf142_grasp.jpg" />
<p align="right" class="small"><autocard>Praetor's Grasp</autocard> | Illustration by <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoileramp;method=visualamp;action=advancedamp;artist=+[%22Steve+Argyle%22]" type="newwindow">Steve Argyle</a></p>

<p><b>Motif:</b><symbol id="space"><i>Enslave</i>.</symbol></p>

<p><b>Agenda:</b> Although the agenda of the Steel Thanes in general is to overpower, corrupt, and enslave all other beings, Sheoldred herself has managed to hold power through the use of subtler methods. She collects debts and manipulates relationships in order to keep her allies in check and her foes as powerless as possible. Her goal is nothing less than control of all of Phyrexia—and she may just get her wish.</p>

<p><b>Trivia:</b> Shudderworthily, Sheoldred's body separates into two pieces. Her relatively humanoid torso actually locks into an access inlet built into her monstrous lower half. Though few have seen it happen, Sheoldred is able to shed her large, predatory, more motile lower body and slither-skitter to a new home.</p>
<img align="center" cap="" src="http://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/stf/stf142_SheoldredConcepts.jpg" />
<p align="right" class="small">Concept art by <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoileramp;method=visualamp;action=advancedamp;artist=+[%22Richard+Whitters%22]">Richard Whitters</a></p>

<p>Note that the bizarre visual designs for the praetors (all thanks to our resident concept artist Richard Whitters) might have made their creature types quite hard to figure out. Thankfully we had already decided that the cycle would all have the creature type Praetor, since we knew that their names would not contain the term "Praetor." By the way, congratulations to <autocard>Ebon Praetor</autocard> and <autocard>Sanguine Praetor</autocard> on their new creature type—Praetor!</p>

    <li>Urabrask the Hidden</li>
</ul>

<p align="right" class="small"><autocard>Urabrask the Hidden</autocard> | Illustration by <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoileramp;method=visualamp;action=advancedamp;artist=+[%22Brad+Rigney%22]" type="newwindow">Brad Rigney</a></p>

<p><b>Role:</b> Urabrask is the praetor of <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/stf/141">the Quiet Furnace</a>, the red-aligned Phyrexian faction. Urabrask commands a more industrial side of Phyrexia, coordinating the forge workers and slag harvesters of the plane's Furnace Layer. Urabrask is unique among the praetors in that he and his faction interact only in limited fashion with the rest of Phyrexia.</p>

<p><b>Appearance:</b> Urabrask is a vicious living machine, a weapon of forged excellence. His core of molten metal is housed within a frame of bone, claw, sharpened steel, and rusted iron. Flues on his back and chest vent heat and noxious gases. Urabrask's fractiousness and unpredictability are legendary; the other laborers in the Furnace Layer give him a wide berth, and his followers know that random acts of violence are to be expected.</p>

<p><b>Motif:</b><symbol id="space"><i>Reforge</i>.</symbol></p>

<p><b>Agenda:</b> Mirran survivors have found refuge in the Furnace Layer, and Urabrask has commanded his furnace legions to turn a blind eye to the refugees. Rather than planning an endgame, Urabrask focuses on the now—and right now, he knows only that the monolithic, freedom-crushing hierarchy of the rest of Phyrexia irks him. For the time being, he works to supply the rest of Phyrexia with the fuel and raw materials it needs to dominate a world.</p>

<p><b>Trivia:</b> It was decided early on that red would be the color most resistant to Phyrexian corruption for the <i>Scars of Mirrodin</i> story. Red's values of self-determination, independence, and passion conflict most with the authoritarian, universal, coercive nature of Phyrexia. It took an entire block to play out, but now it's clear that the color red is sort of like the last victim to die in a zombie movie—it escapes the touch of corruption the longest and maintains defiance even as the enemy swarms around it.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Vorinclex, Voice of Hunger</li>
</ul>
<img align="center" cap="" src="http://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/stf/stf140_v.jpg" />
<p align="right" class="small"><autocard>Vorinclex, Voice of Hunger</autocard> | Illustration by <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoileramp;method=visualamp;action=advancedamp;artist=+[%22Karl+Kopinski%22]" type="newwindow">Karl Kopinski</a></p>

<p><b>Role:</b> Vorinclex is the praetor of <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/stf/140">the Vicious Swarm</a>, the green-aligned Phyrexian faction. While Vorinclex leads the faction and holds ultimate authority, the Phyrexianized elf Glissa ("the Traitor") controls much of the Vicious Swarm's fighting force. Glissa pressed for Phyrexians to leave the Core and begin the assault on the surface of Mirrodin, while Vorinclex spends much of his time in the ruins of Tel-Jilad. The nature of the Vicious Swarm means that no leader is particularly revered, however—the survival of the fittest is the only sovereign among this bloc of terrifying apex predators.</p>

<p><b>Appearance:</b> Bestial and hideously <i>anatomical</i>, Vorinclex is the praetor who appears the most organic in his construction—and yet his philosophy aligns with Phyrexia's hatred of flesh and idealization of the machine. Grown deep within the Core from a system of vats and birthing pods, Vorinclex is an artificial design that represents one of Phyrexia's greatest successes in replicating the ferocity and ruthlessness of nature.</p>

<p><b>Motif:</b><symbol id="space"><i>Consume</i>.</symbol></p>

<p><b>Agenda:</b> Vorinclex seeks to achieve Phyrexian perfection by using the plane as one grand arena, subsuming the strong and devouring the weak. Any flaw in Phyrexia's strength is to be hunted down and consumed in a process of simulated, guided, "natural" selection.</p>

<p><b>Trivia:</b> The earliest depiction of the New Phyrexia's praetors on cards was Vorinclex, shown counseling Karn in the art of <autocard>Praetor's Counsel</autocard> from <i>Mirrodin Besieged</i>. Many of the praetors show up in the art of other cards in <i>New Phyrexia</i>. You can also see a shot of Urabrask in the background of <autocard>Act of Aggression</autocard>. Jin-Gitaxias is depicted doing something horrible to a victim in the art of <autocard>Psychic Surgery</autocard>. Elesh Norn lashes out on <autocard>Marrow Shards</autocard>. And Sheoldred can be seen taking possession of an Auriok's soul in the art of <autocard>Praetor's Grasp</autocard>.</p>

    <li>Letter of the Week</li>
</ul>

<p>Since we've been broadcasting <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/142">the Planeswalker's Guide to New Phyrexia</a> in this space for the past five weeks, it's been a while since I've written in my actual columnist voice. I wanted to point out that we're grateful for the gobs of positive feedback we've gotten about the Guide and the twisted detail behind the look and philosophy of New Phyrexia over these last weeks. The entire creative team worked hard on that material, so I thank you for the feedback!</p>
<img align="center" cap="" src="http://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/stf/stf142_priest.jpg" />
<p align="right" class="small"><autocard>Suture Priest</autocard> | Illustration by <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoileramp;method=visualamp;action=advancedamp;artist=+[%22Igor+Kieryluk%22]" type="newwindow">Igor Kieryluk</a></p>

<p>I know that the intellectually warped villainy and horrid metal-and-flesh imagery of Phyrexia is not for everyone, so I'm happy to hear there are so many of you for whom <i>New Phyrexia</i> is firing on all of its oily flavor-pistons. Like everything in <b>Magic</b>, the tone of <b>Magic</b>'s settings swings on a pendulum, and so we'll see changes in mood and atmosphere in the future. But at the same time, when we do Phyrexia, we feel it's important to hit that note and hit it hard.</p>

<p>There's a lot of mail to get through since the Guide started running, so let's get a good one off the top of the stack.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="mvtext">Dear Doug Beyer,</p>

<p class="mvtext">I was browsing through the New Phyrexia card image list, and came across the fun <autocard>Sensor Splicer</autocard>. I noticed, however, that it's the only Splicer which isn't Human, in fact, along with the Exarchs and <autocard>Suture Priest</autocard>, it's the only non-artifact creature in the set that doesn't have a race. Is there a reason for this?</p>

<p class="mvtext">Sincerely,<br />
Julian K.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Good question, Julian. Frankly, Phyrexia is hell on the creature type system. One man's Horror is another woman's Construct is a third person's Insect Zombie Thopter. Phyrexia is explicitly a mishmash of vat-grown flesh and engineered metal, sinew wrapped around rotors, buffered by undead tissue and shot through with viral oil. The artifact/nonartifact boundary is already blurry, and creature type boundaries even more so.</p>

<table align="center" cellpadding="15">
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td align="center"><auto-card>Sensor Splicer</auto-card></td>
            <td align="center"><auto-card>Tormentor Exarch</auto-card></td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>So we turned to a little-used technique in creature typing and gave it a Phyrexian twist. Ever since the first <i>Mirrodin</i> Block we've given almost all sentient humanoids a "race" type, and most of them a "class" type too. A goblin shown brandishing a club is a <autocard name="Goblin Cohort">Goblin Warrior</autocard>. A vedalken casting a spell is a <autocard name="Ethersworn Shieldmage">Vedalken Wizard</autocard>. But when the class isn't so clear, either from the rules text, flavor text, or art of the card, we sometimes leave the class type off. <autocard>Bazaar Trader</autocard>, for example, is just a Goblin—he doesn't really advertise himself as a Shaman or a Warrior or a Rogue or Advisor or whatever, so we just left him a Goblin.</p>
<auto-card>Bazaar Trader</auto-card>

<p>Now check out <autocard>Arcanis the Omnipotent</autocard> in <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Default.aspx">Gatherer</a>. Even after the Grand Creature Type Update, he's just a Wizard—no race type. Arcanis gets a lot of his cool from the fact that his hood and cloak completely obscure his race, so we didn't give him one. The only thing that's incontrovertible is that he's a Wizard, so a Wizard he is. Same idea as the classless Goblin (heh)—his subtype calls out whatever's clear about him, rather than making a judgment call that feels wrong for the card.</p>
<auto-card>Arcanis the Omnipotent</auto-card>

<p>And it's the same idea for those raceless Phyrexians, taken to the next level. Oftentimes there just isn't a race type that properly captures what's going on in the art of those guys. In Phyrexia, your role determines most of your identity anyway. What you do to advance the civilization of Phyrexia is much more important than what vat-grown or slag-harvested materials you're made from. The concept of a "species" is just more slippery here. So some of those unclear Phyrexian creatures end up being just Clerics or Artificers—identified only by their role in the machine and not by the tattered remnants of their biological identities. We feel that it makes a strong, flavorful statement about the bizarre conditions of life on a Phyrexian plane. Thanks for your question, Julian!</p>

While not all their tales can be told in the <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/story" target="_blank"><em>Streets of New Capenna </em>stories</a>, here you'll find brief backstories of those legends you'll encounter.</p>

<h1>New Legends</h1>

<h2>Jaxis, the Troublemaker</h2>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Jaxis, the Troublemaker" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/snc/en_IKI2aeHNX7.png" /><img alt="Jaxis, the Troublemaker" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/snc/en_aGTdJy27Mx.png" /><img alt="Jaxis, the Troublemaker" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/snc/en_ulMGfeZB3h.png" /></p>

<p>Demons rule New Capenna, but word from the Caldaia is that won't be true for long.</p>

<p>There's a star down there in the boxing rings, a name lifted by the cheering crowds of New Capenna's deepest borough: Jaxis, the Troublemaker. She's a fighter, a boxer, one of the best to ever do it. Got a right hook like the Capenna main line and a jab like a jackhammer. Undefeated, she's good enough that people have started to talk; following a failed hit on her by Maestro assassins, people have started to hope.</p>

<p>Everyone saw it. The assassins cornered her, outnumbered her five to one, and then in a flash she was surrounded by burning shadows—shadows the people recognized. They were other champions; some she'd fought, some who had retired or passed on long ago. Called to her side, they walloped the assassins, driving them away to the cheers of the bystanders. Jaxis isn't just the best, the people say: she's blessed. Demons might rule New Capenna, but fighters like Jaxis bring the people hope.</p>

<h2>Falco Spara, Pactweaver</h2>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Falco Spara, Pactweaver" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/snc/en_4dfq9jFWAs.png" /><img alt="Golden age Falco Spara, Pactweaver" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/snc/en_s2RI1VGVtJ.png" /><img alt="Gilded Falco Spara, Pactweaver" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/snc/en_DhYuHYFyKO.png" /></p>

<p>New Capenna's foundation lies shrouded in mystery, a fog produced of time, passing generations, and magic. Few beings have clear memory of the city's beginning, but first among that exclusive group is the head of the Brokers: Falco Spara, Pactweaver.</p>

<p>Raised from mortality to deamonhood during New Capenna's founding days, Falco Spara is a rigorous, exacting mind. Falco has built his Brokers to become New Capenna's professional protectors of the highest order. Their pacts and contracts are binding—sometimes literally—providing their signees with protection in exchange for a debt, to be claimed at a later date. To those in need of even more protection, Falco has trained his Brokers in shielding magics, offering them as personal bodyguards and protectors to anyone in New Capenna who can afford it.</p>

<p>Falco was on top of the world, a lord of Park Heights. Each of the other four families relied on his Brokers for protection, as well as much of the city's civic and social elite. And then the Adversary came, and Falco discovered how far the fall is from the top of the world.</p>

<h2>Cormela, Glamour Thief</h2>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Cormela, Glamour Thief" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/snc/en_fWMh7Tvjhy.png" /><img alt="Golden age Cormela, Glamour Thief" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/snc/en_o1sm3WxWjs.png" /><img alt="Gilded Cormela, Glamour Thief" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/snc/en_IjNDyA3xRl.png" /></p>

<p>Glamour cannot be stolen, darling. One either is or is not glamourous, which is something one tells the world when they step out to face it. Cormela knows this and lives her life accordingly. Cormela is glamour, grace, opulence—she is the scene, a driver of Park Heights style and curator mentored under Lord Xander's own personal instruction.</p>

<p>A professional with her own gallery in Park Heights, Cormela's public collection is small and rotates on a frequent basis. Eager young artists—her coterie and those hungry for admission—offer their most avant-garde, most daring, most radical work to her first; to be one of Cormela's favorites is to be the talk of New Capenna.</p>

<p>But this is not all Cormela is. A Maestro first, Cormela is one of Lord Xander's favorite acquisition agents, able to "recover" work from even the most tightly guarded private collections without their owners suspecting a thing. Her prey are those who attempt to weasel out of deals and contracts with Lord Xander: easy marks. Those too proud, arrogant, or naive to think that a glamourous young tastemaker cannot also be a cutthroat genius<nbsp> . . .</nbsp></p>

<h2>Evelyn, the Covetous</h2>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Evelyn, the Covetous" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/snc/en_HZ1n3mHHBE.png" /><img alt="Evelyn, the Covetous" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/snc/en_QxdkDUGHkM.png" /><img alt="Gilded Evelyn, the Covetous" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/snc/en_On7EE8Zq0G.png" /></p>

<p>Few people in New Capenna remember the old world. There are some of the especially aged sphinxes in the Obscura and a handful of wizened Rhox among the reveling ranks of the Cabaretti who were there in the early days. The Maestros boast the greatest complement of long-lived members—easy enough when they lay claim to Xander's gift of vampirism—but most of them, too, were made after the shining tower of New Capenna was raised. No, the true old guard is vanishingly small: the heads of the five families, and Evelyn, the Covetous.</p>

<p>Once, she called Lord Xander a lover—but that was lifetimes and passions ago. The first to receive the gift of vampirism from Xander, Evelyn still remembers the old days of Old Capenna, what the world was like before it was emptied. In the time since, she has lived many lives, but through them all, she has collected and maintained a sprawling private collection of artifacts from the old world. Her expertise is such that she is one of the only people besides Lord Xander himself to have access to his private archives.</p>

<p>Polite and generous, accommodating to young Maestros—they're all young to her—and initiates to the family, Evelyn is nonetheless not one to be underestimated. She may be a collector, but she was a killer first, and any life less than her own is a life that can be cheaply spent<nbsp> . . .</nbsp></p>

<h2>Jinnie Fay, Jetmir's Second</h2>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Jinnie Fay, Jetmir's Second" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/snc/en_Bmqkl5FOXg.png" /><img alt="Golden age Jinnie Fay, Jetmir's Second" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/snc/en_bNDmIZJjFG.png" /><img alt="Gilded Jinnie Fay, Jetmir's Second" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/snc/en_BaB49B35Ih.png" /></p>

<p>An orphan discovered in the Mezzio by Cabaretti talent scouts, Jinnie Fay proved herself a skilled fighter in the service of the Vantoleone's guards. Her talent with blades caught the eye of Jetmir, who brought her on to his personal guard; she endeared herself to the old leonin, who looks upon her as a daughter he never had. Deadly, beautiful, and with a deep love for life's finery, Jinnie now lives as the heir apparent to the Cabaretti. In addition to being Jetmir's most loyal, trusted lieutenant, Jinnie spends much of her time managing the Cabaretti's vast kennels where expert menagerie-keepers raise rare breeds of urban wildlife and exotic teacup creatures.</p>

<p>During the events of the Crescendo and the Adversary's War, Jinnie made an uncomfortable, often abrasive alliance-of-the-moment with Elspeth and Vivien to protect Jetmir, her adoptive father, from the Adversary's henchmen. Rebuffed in her efforts to steal Giada back from the planeswalkers, Jinnie now focuses on rebuilding the broken Cabaretti to their prior glory.</p>

<h2>Raffine, Scheming Seer</h2>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Raffine, Scheming Seer" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/snc/en_EEdSlMpAex.png" /><img alt="Golden age Raffine, Scheming Seer" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/snc/en_sWcFJ32hWw.png" /><img alt="Gilded Raffine, Scheming Seer" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/snc/en_AmuQry3yip.png" /></p>

<p>The sphinxes of Old Capenna were never many. Territorial and vain, they competed over public acclaim, fear, and devotion, crafting prophetic forecasts to drive the masses to their temples. As a young sphinx, Raffine could count on half a paw the number of her own kind she knew personally: her mother, who cast her out when she could fly; her rival, whose augury contradicted her own as much as Raffine's did hers; and her lover, whose name and face Raffine can no longer remember.</p>

<p>That changed when <em>they</em> came. Raffine's prophecies—which no one wanted to hear, because they were dark and grim and spoke of a shining metal end—were correct. She alone was raised up, granted demonic investiture by an archdemon, and now in New Capenna's art deco grandeur, Raffine is one of the only sphinxes that remains. Good. She likes it that way. Let her "family" serve her, let them inscribe her dreams in ink as they feed her theirs. Let her prophecy dictate the future of the city. At least this time they might listen when she says another end is coming—she dreams of nothing else<nbsp> . . .</nbsp></p>

<h2>Lord Xander, the Collector</h2>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Lord Xander, the Collector" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/snc/en_7524e8toGT.png" /><img alt="Golden age Lord Xander, the Collector" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/snc/en_iNR7xiXrwX.png" /><img alt="Gilded Lord Xander, the Collector" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/snc/en_5DLjZTEqx4.png" /></p>

<p>Lord Xander, the head of the Maestros, would think himself first among equals if any equals presented themselves to him. Until that happens, he reigns as the self-appointed curator of New Capenna's history and orchestrator of its present. History he stages through exhibitions in the Maestros's many galleries, museums, and archives. The present he orchestrates through the Maestros's skilled, discreet assassins for hire.</p>

<p>Lord Xander is burdened by three gifts: vampirism, which grants him all but eternal life; a demonic blessing, which grants him power; and a crown, whose weight he cannot feel now that noble titles mean nothing. Taken together, Lord Xander bears the mantle of the collector and curator of New Capenna. Curation is exhausting work, a labor that has increasingly begun to remind him of his old life before the city rose and the age of knights, lords, and monsters fell behind. He was an artist once. With the approach of the Crescendo—the citywide year-end celebration—Lord Xander plots once more a great work to resonate throughout the city.</p>

<h2>Ziatora, the Incinerator</h2>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Ziatora, the Incinerator" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/snc/en_urVUmhx2o1.png" /><img alt="Golden age Ziatora, the Incinerator" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/snc/en_Dn55zU5xP6.png" /><img alt="Gilded Ziatora, the Incinerator" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/snc/en_erbXhTA4Th.png" /></p>

<p>The other dragons called her many things: a fool, a traitor to dragonkind, too vain even for them. Ziatora, the head of the Riveteers, heard it all from her kin when she first agreed to the archdemon's contract. But where are the other dragons now? For all their righteousness, their gloating and purity, the great dragons of Old Capenna are dust. The mighty guardians of dragonkind reduced to skulls and teeth, polished and shining under the lights of the Museum of Old Capenna, while Ziatora rules the Caldaia.</p>

<p>Now, Ziatora is power. Ziatora is wealth. Ziatora is the Incinerator, the champion of the working creatures of the Caldaia and the engineer of New Capenna. The archdemons and their angelic patsies may have sunk the first foundation columns and laid the great girders, but it was Ziatora and her laborers who built the city out of scaffolding. As well it is Ziatora now who sits atop the greatest treasure of the five families: New Capenna's single largest store of Halo is under the Riveteer's control. In an age where this precious resource is dwindling as demand for it increases, to command the flow of Halo is to dictate the fate of the city; should this monopoly be challenged, it would mean war.</p>

<h2>Giada, Font of Hope</h2>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Giada, Font of Hope" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/snc/en_YlMOdIxQ51.png" /> <img alt="Art deco Giada, Font of Hope" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/snc/en_wav3q0ouWr.png" /> <img alt="Foil-etched Giada, Font of Hope" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/snc/en_yVF4MjfvOb.png" /></p>

<p>Giada, a young girl from the orphan halls of the Mezzio's lower districts, is the Cabaretti's best-kept secret, New Capenna's greatest hope, and the other families' most dangerous threat. Discovered by Cabaretti talent scouts, Giada fast became a favorite of Jinnie's—the kid sister Jinnie always wanted but never had—and Jetmir's greatest treasure. Giada is special. A gifted singer, she fits in well with her cohort of Cabaretti ingenue, socialites, and starlets. But unlike the rest of them, she has a gift never before encountered in New Capenna: with a touch and a wish, she can turn even the foulest city sewage into pure Halo. The Cabaretti hurried to keep her under wraps, but their appetite for the magic substance overrode their caution: their parties, already legendarily Halo fueled, grew to excess.</p>

<p>In a time of increasing scarcity and desperation for Halo among the other families, the Cabaretti were unaffected. With Giada, the Cabaretti don't need to restrain themselves. With Giada, the balance of power in the city has been turned on its head. All Giada ever wanted was a family. Through no fault of her own—by a gift that seems more to her like a curse—she now has five that want her.</p>

<h2>Lagrella, the Magpie</h2>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Lagrella, the Magpie" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/snc/en_UkMJaSxV86.png" /> <img alt="Golden age Lagrella, the Magpie" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/snc/en_VIRzALcCMN.png" /> <img alt="Gilded Lagrella, the Magpie" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/snc/en_kqdq49YU83.png" /></p>

<p>Lagrella, the Magpie is one of the Brokers's most feared and respected enforcers. A contract mage in Falco's personal orbit, Lagrella is allowed to take some license with the agreements she oversees: "a little off the top" of every transaction is the expected fee all Brokers take for their work, so Lagrella takes what is due someone of her station.</p>

<p>Lagrella's fearsome reputation—and nickname—comes from rumors of what she does with her money. She has a collection of exotic fish that she keeps in her penthouse in a massive tank. In that tank, there is a garden of gold and silver statues: life-sized figures that capture in harrowing detail the faces of people who once broke her contracts. Praised even by the Maestros for the quality of these sculptures, only Lagrella knows the truth: those statues are those contract breakers, dipped in molten metal and dropped into her fish tank to rest, forever.</p>

<h2>Rocco, Cabaretti Caterer</h2>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Rocco, Cabaretti Caterer" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/snc/en_fgi1hSr7BR.png" /><img alt="Golden age Rocco, Cabaretti Caterer" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/snc/en_cyTTbhbQkO.png" /><img alt="Gilded Rocco, Cabaretti Caterer" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/snc/en_HOaKFuppiN.png" /></p>

<p>Rocco is the gregarious head chef at the Vantoleone, the Cabaretti's premier event space, gathering hall, and dance floor. Rocco manages not only the various kitchens of the Vantoleone, but the menus of the many clubs, restaurants, diners, and speakeasies the Cabaretti own as well, working behind the scenes to dictate the tastes of Park Heights's elite. Their culinary empire spans all levels of New Capenna.</p>

<p>Their mastery of logistics is matched by their deft hand in the kitchen; each dish they devise is a masterpiece of balance, combining different flavors and textures to create events out of even the most mundane food. With the introduction of Halo to New Capenna, Rocco's cuisine has found new heights of excellence, and their sous chefs say they've never seen Rocco so inspired.</p>

<h2>Rigo, Streetwise Mentor</h2>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Rigo, Streetwise Mentor" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/snc/en_3zOMd3f66l.png" /> <img alt="Golden age Rigo, Streetwise Mentor" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/snc/en_Waj6GvwVAi.png" /> <img alt="Gilded Rigo, Streetwise Mentor" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/snc/en_KD6owVKE4b.png" /></p>

<p>The Brokers, for all their Park Heights exclusivity, never discount the strength of community or the knowledge that comes from the streets. Looking up, they say, is looking forward. Some of their best enforcers and contract mages come from strivers, kids out of the Caldaia and Mezzio who hustle to get themselves into the family and keep that drive with them to advance up the Brokers's ranks.</p>

<p>Rigo was one of those kids. A street kid in the Mezzio, Rigo had dreams of working with New Capenna's angels. The Brokers were a close second, and so he hustled to catch the eye of Brokers recruiters. As a youth, Rigo built his own network of newsies, pickpockets, shoeshine kids, porters, and errand runners to help Brokers deployed to the Mezzio keep informed, stylish, fed, and paid under the table. He was successful and found himself quickly adopted by the Mezzio's Brokers. Advanced up the chain to the finer firms in Park Heights, Rigo never lost that striver's drive. Now a full-fledged Broker, Rigo never forgets where he came from: he volunteered to serve in the Mezzio, taking special care to look after the kids that remind him so much of himself.</p>

<h2>Ognis, the Dragon's Lash</h2>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Ognis, the Dragon's Lash" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/snc/en_Mt2OeQnPea.png" /><img alt="Golden age Ognis, the Dragon's Lash" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/snc/en_0i3plIRQBx.png" /><img alt="Gilded Ognis, the Dragon's Lash" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/snc/en_AQ2CAOGFvX.png" /></p>

<p>Even dragons need assistants. While the big lizards count the money, someone's gotta make sure their operations run smooth and the Halo stays flowing. Ognis is Ziatora's first captain, a Viashino in Ziatora's own image—if smaller, to satisfy the old demon-dragon's vanity. A front-line tough, Ognis is the overseer of all Halo trade in the Caldaia and master strategist behind the Riveteer's low city–raiding operations.</p>

<p>Though her front-line status might make her seem low-ranking among the family elite, for the Riveteers, staying on the front lines is a mark of strength and solidarity. Scrapping and fighting are hard work—those cut out for the life often find it a short one. Ognis, though she was one of the first Viashino at Ziatora's side and remains one of the few to be granted Ziatora's coveted green flame, still stands shoulder to shoulder with her comrades, breaking heads and counting coins.</p>

<h2>Jetmir, Nexus of Revels</h2>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Jetmir, Nexus of Revels" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/snc/en_0q1cl2xVjJ.png" /><img alt="Golden age Jetmir, Nexus of Revels" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/snc/en_si3RO8g5Bs.png" /><img alt="Gilded Jetmir, Nexus of Revels" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/snc/en_eSysHv3rVO.png" /></p>

<p>The emcee of New Capenna is more than a warm heart and an expensive suit—he's the living spirit of New Capenna, the one-demon dynamo around which the elite orbit and turn to like the sun. There would be no scene without Jetmir. Without his coin, his approval, and his Halo, New Capenna is just a tower in an empty world. People gotta live, not just survive; Jetmir learned that early on. Now, it's his life's work to make sure that people live in his version of New Capenna.</p>

<p>Jetmir is the founder and boss of the Cabaretti, one of New Capenna's five families. In ages past, he led a sect of leonin druids. In Old Capenna, they were masters of ritual and rite, cultists of the natural world—its bounty, beauty, and the cycles that move because of and within all things. Life, death, rebirth, and life eternal, Jetmir's cult carried within them the spirit of the family that would become the Cabaretti before the first migration to New Capenna. He and his order kept the early settlers entertained, kept their spirits up, and in turn, they kept them fed and warm. This relationship, though far removed from how it began, is essentially the same now. Jetmir keeps the Halo flowing, the music playing, and the dance floor burning, and New Capenna loves him for it.</p>

<h2>Parnesse, the Subtle Brush</h2>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Parnesse, the Subtle Brush" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/ncc/en_050yMAeZoh.png" /> <img alt="Extended-art Parnesse, the Subtle Brush" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/ncc/en_JpVkVUZkCa.png" /></p>

<p>Being skilled and confident enough to paint a vampire is a valuable skill that leads to a dangerous job. They can't see themselves in mirrors, see? So the way you paint 'em is the way they see themselves. Lotta risk there, lotta reward. Even for other vampires, who run every risk from getting a stake through them for a poor review to never getting their own portrait done.</p>

<p>Parnesse is one of the best, a portrait artist who specializes in painting vampires not necessarily how they look, but how they wish to be seen. She has a subtle brush—and a flashy bit of Obscura magic (a gift, from a friend)—that helps her see her subjects most confident self-image. A touch of smoother skin here, a lift of the fang there, a tug over there—the vampires who commission a portrait from Parnesse see themselves clearer and more beautiful (or fearsome) than ever, and for that, they keep Parnesse paid in full and booked for the foreseeable future.</p>

<h2>Bennie Bracks, Zoologist</h2>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Bennie Bracks, Zoologist" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/ncc/en_51Oq8C76xQ.png" /> <img alt="Extended-art Bennie Bracks, Zoologist" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/ncc/en_agdKcxTNW0.png" /></p>

<p>Before Bennie became New Capenna's zoologist-to-the-stars, he was a kid keeping pigeons on the forever-dusk rooftops of the Mezzio. There, with the underside of Park Heights high above, surrounded by the iron and grease of the city, Bennie dreamed of a green and living world. His coop was a modest one, curated with the eye of an enthusiast on a limited budget. His birds, a curiosity first, became his escape: Through informal shows and trades, Bennie found his way into the formal pageants, where his birds—unique among those in the city—caught the eye of Park Heights's traders and keepers, none more tastemaking than Jinnie Fay, Jetmir's adopted daughter. With the stroke of Jinnie's pen and the glowing reviews that followed, Bennie and his birds had made it.</p>

<p>Though Bennie is not officially affiliated with the Cabaretti, he is their first-choice dealer for rare and beautiful creatures. No longer a mere expert in urban birds, Bennie branched out into all manner of exotic, expensive pets: teacup mammals, ancient reptiles, fish from oceans far, far away—Bennie cares for them all, even the ones destined for Rocco's own kitchen.</p>

<h2>Denry Klin, Editor in Chief</h2>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Denry Klin, Editor in Chief" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/ncc/en_Wu3bNrz9Nn.png" /> <img alt="Extended-art Denry Klin, Editor in Chief" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/ncc/en_6aKcn8wLs6.png" /></p>

<p>Nothing is sacred in New Capenna anymore, not since the angels left. No story—real or imagined—is off limits if it means moving ink and paper. What matters to the newsman is that the news, warts and all, gets to the eyes of the people, and that his paper gets the news to them first. For the working people of the Caldaia and the Mezzio, it might be the labor reports, boxing recaps, and bridge announcements. For the socialites and playboys of Park Heights, it may be the society pages, the gossip columns, and the stock numbers. For the five families, it might be the obituaries, the classifieds, or what passes for the crime beat: the broadsheets of New Capenna are as much at war over readership as the five families are over Halo. This is a war that Denry Klin, the editor in chief of the Capenna Herald, is determined to win.</p>

<p>Born into the gray guild of reporters, Denry Klin knows the news. His ascension to the role of editor in chief of the Capenna Herald was no less brutal for its bloodless achievement. In his mind, the warring papers of New Capenna—the Caldaia Union-Post, the Mezzio Star-Times, the Park Heights Zenith, the New Capenna Vanguard, and his own Capenna Herald—are the "sixth family" of the city. What they lack in enforcers and muscle they replace with beat reporters, gossip columnists, and photographers; though they might not stack bodies, they shine a light on those who do—unless the killer is willing to pay to kill the story as well.</p>

<h2>Bess, Soul Nourisher</h2>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Bess, Soul Nourisher" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/ncc/en_MYDTBLc1D5.png" /> <img alt="Extended-art Bess, Soul Nourisher" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/ncc/en_TzF24H85M7.png" /></p>

<p>Food nourishes the soul. Without it, you can't survive, of course, but with bad food, you don't really live. The pretty ones up in Park Heights might enjoy their frothed foams, delicate medallions, microgreen sprays, and choice of cuts, but down-city people gotta eat as well. The people need to fuel, to nourish their bodies and their souls, not just thrill their palates. Bess is the city's best- and worst-kept secret: a cook to rival the white-coated chefs of Park Heights and a logistician to shame the five family's most experienced smugglers. A master of her craft, she does her work for donations and the people that more expensive restaurants (with worse food) exclude from their tables.</p>

<p>Once a sous chef under Rocco, Bess broke off to form her own kitchen, seeking to bring her skills down-city, back to the streets where she grew up. The people up-city have no appreciation for the art of cooking, only for being seen in the right places by the right people. Food is meant to be enjoyed, meant to be loved. For Bess, cooking was never about impressing people—it was about feeding people. That her food happens to be some of the best in the city is, in her opinion, added proof of the righteousness of her mission: to cook for the people.</p>

<h2>Oskar, Rubbish Reclaimer</h2>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Oskar, Rubbish Reclaimer" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/ncc/en_dnFrEb0WCd.png" /> <img alt="Extended-art Oskar, Rubbish Reclaimer" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/ncc/en_O677Xui1kj.png" /></p>

<p>Secrets are only secret if everyone who is party to them is dead. No one wants to acknowledge this. They all think that keeping mum, that shredding their documents, that tossing knowledge down trash chutes and into rat-infested sewers is good enough to cover their trails. Not so. Not at all.</p>

<p>No matter how secure a building is, there are always two ways to get the information it holds: through the plumbing or through the trash. While other Obscura agents prefer to keep clean, Oskar, Rubbish Reclaimer, goes straight to the source. He is a solitary presence among the Obscura's revealers and investigators. A dirty, stinking trash man, he knows every rat in the sewer and dumping spot for every chute in the city. His magic charms the city's rodents, turning the overlooked pests into his own personal army of thieves and spies able to snatch enough of any "disposed-of" document and bring them to him for reconstruction. Secrets other families thought well buried often come crawling up from the sewers to haunt them, all thanks to Oskar's dirty work.</p>

<h2>Perrie, the Pulverizer</h2>

<p>Perrie didn't start off no suit-slinging Brokers agent. Big kid for his age, he ran errands for a watchmaker down in the Verts. But the old tinkerer was down on his luck. Never made the rent on time, bless his soul. Perrie swore he'd do right by his friend and entered the boxing ring for some of that sweet, sweet prize money. Turns out he was good at swinging those big fists. Real good. Earned himself a shiny new nickname, "Perrie, the Pulverizer." But violence for money never sat quite right.</p>

<p>That all changed when the pair was discussing a new watch over a coffee and a nearby robbery went south. The getaway car was barreling straight toward their café table! Fearless as ever, Perrie body slammed that automobile into the pavement. He saved the old man's life, though the watch didn't make it. The Brokers who came to evaluate the damage took a shine to Perrie's heroism and offered him a new gig, swinging a big gavel. This time, for the side of good. Heck, they even crafted him some fine armor from that wrecked car. But Perrie's still carrying that smashed-up watch. Sentimental and all, not like he'd admit that to ya.</p>

<h2>Kamiz, Obscura Oculus</h2>

<p>Kamiz don't miss a single thing going on in this city. She's got every citizen in her back pocket, and they don't even know her name. Started off trying to be a journalist, 'til she found out every paper was printing complete bunk at the command of whichever clients had the deepest pockets. Always the bookish type, she never took to reporting anyway. Them interview subjects always gave her funny looks, what with those glowing blue eyes of hers. She was downright sick of all them stares.</p>

<p>So, she signed up with the Obscura with the promise she could do her job outta sight from prying eyes. On her very first assignment, she got her spies to blackmail a corrupt politician into stepping down from office. Worked her way up the org right quick after that. Shot right to the top after she invented a spell that let her see through walls. Now, she runs the whole Obscura network, gathering info from sewer to skyscraper. Guess she's still a journalist in that way, since all the papers' stories are coming right from her.</p>

<h2>Anhelo, the Painter</h2>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Anhelo, the Painter" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/ncc/en_peKr516Z6R.png" /><img alt="Anhelo, the Painter" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/ncc/en_1LI9KeiA0P.png" /></p>

<p>Anhelo is a historian and a businessman all in one. Any business deal or contract with the Maestros or their museum gotta go through him. He won't say how he got his job, but that tidbit of knowledge is the family's worst-kept secret. He was Lord Xander's right-hand man before the city was built, and he still is today. Don't let his title fool you; he's just moonlighting as a wealthy museum curator. Personally trained by Lord Xander for centuries, Anhelo is one of the best assassins in the city.</p>

<p>Guess all that time in the gallery got it into his head he should become an artist, even if killing was still much more profitable. The man can't resist a little creative flourish here and there. Dagger, paintbrush, it's all the same to him. He loves to set a corpse up with a crime scene so pretty, any bystanders wish they'd been knocked off instead. Calls it his art, his bit of "hidden spectacle." Maybe he's trying to impress his boss or his darling daughter. Kinda unnecessary, if you ask the average citizen, but hey, vampires are just like that sometimes.</p>

<p>Most people 'round here got too many secrets to be too fond of a songbird, but them Cabaretti ain't kiddin' when they say Kitt Kanto's the only one worth a listen. Who knew Jetmir would find the real cat's meow down in a subway stairwell, purring peppy jazz ditties for pennies? Now she's takin' top-billing center stage at the Cabaretti's main drag every night. That's the real ritzy, rags-to-riches stuff that puts stars o' hope into every kid's eyes. Everyone who wantsa be someone's carrying a torch for that gal, lit bright as day.</p>

<p>Ain't no spotlight in town that ain't eyein' Kitt, and she dang glows in 'em. Them glittering sequins might be makeup, or heck, maybe even magic. She's real keen on them druid verses those Cabaretti preach and croons 'em like lyrics. Hearin' it makes you feel like real gold, it does. But be sure to leave some roses on the stage when the curtain closes, y'know? Piss her off, and you'll learn this kitten's got claws! That microphone of hers can cast some nasty spells that'll set you howling. Or maybe, she'll use them swing musician street smarts and just straight up beat your face in. Me-yowch!</p>

<p>Ain't no one call him Henzie 'cept his momma. But if you're looking to hire the Toolbox himself, you gotta have the goods. That sly little acrobat can nab anything your pretty little heart fancies, but he'll want a cut off the top. And those services don't come cheap. His own fiancée asked him to snag her some designer wedding gown, and he up and took her engagement ring back as payment. Can't say they lasted too long after that, but why's he need love when he's got money?</p>

<p>Says he's part of the Riveteers and all, moves construction materials for 'em. But rumor's got it that he's tucked away his own private stash, hidden so good his boss, Ziatora, don't even know. Bet that's where all those missing weapons shipments have ended up. No idea what he plans on using 'em for. Maybe he just likes to sit atop it all and gloat like he's the king of Park Heights, basking in the Halo glow. Loves shiny things, always decked out in gems like a dang chandelier. But if those knuckle-dusters hit you in the kisser, you'll be seein' sparks for days.</p>

<p>A change is coming to New Phyrexia. Freedom tempered in a red furnace will be the fire that sparks a revolution. That, at least, is Urabrask's secret hope. Until then, he must play his part. Recovering from his transit to this plane, the Rebel Praetor stays hidden deep in the bowels of New Capenna's Caldaia. Urabrask may as well be at home: here, the world is a maze of furnaces, boilers, steam pipes, and foundries. It's a crude mirror of his realm on New Phyrexia, but close enough to lend him strength as he plans his next move.</p>

Though she escaped when her Planeswalker spark ignited, she never forgot her captors; the memory of them keeps her awake at night.

<p>Vivien wants to honor the lessons of her homeworld. The last survivor of Skalla, a plane where advocates of progress and guardians of nature failed to find balance, Vivien works tirelessly to ensure that her people's mistakes are not repeated elsewhere in the Multiverse. She is a conservationist and keen observer of nature who cultivates healthier civilizations by sharing lessons from the natural world. She hopes that, by fostering in others the sense of wonder and respect that she feels for nature, she can preserve the beautiful diversity of life in the Multiverse and honor the memory of her own lost world.</p>

<h2>Ob Nixilis, the Adversary</h2>

<p>Ob Nixilis wants dominion over others. Before he became a demon, Ob Nixilis was a human warlord obsessed with conquest. In his pursuit of power, he was transformed by the Chain Veil, an ancient magical artifact. Although he initially sought to remove the curse, he eventually embraced his new form and the power it bestowed on him. Ob Nixilis enjoys subjugating others and is a collector of petty servants, hoarding the broken shells of his former foes in servitude to himself. He takes special pleasure in the challenge of breaking or corrupting the strong or noble and bringing them under his dominion. Though he has established domains on many worlds over his long life, he grows bored quickly and the need for fresh conquests drives him to move on.</p>

If you're here looking for a summary of the new mechanics and how they work, please check out <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/commander-legends-battle-baldurs-gate-mechanics-2022-05-18" target="_blank">the set's mechanics article</a>.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that the rules are still under review at the time of this writing. When they are published, they can be found on our <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/gameplay/rules-and-formats/rules" target="_blank">rules page</a>. If there should be a discrepancy between this summary and the official rules, the official rules take precedence.</p>

<h1>New and Updated rules</h1>

<h2>Take the Initiative</h2>

<h2>721</h2>

<p>Listed first here for obvious reasons, this is the new section that defines the initiative designation and everything associated with it. The rules for restarting the game, subgames, and so on have all been bumped down a number.</p>

<h2>Venture into Undercity</h2>

<h2>205.3p</h2>

<p>This new rule explains that Undercity, the new dungeon card in this set, also has a subtype. That subtype is Undercity. It's worth noting that while this subtype is used by the "venture into Undercity" ability (see below), no cards interact with dungeon types.</p>

<h2>701.46d</h2>

<p>This is the rule that explains how the "venture into Undercity" variant of venture into the dungeon works.</p>

<h2>Choose a Background</h2>

<h2>702.124h</h2>

<p>This rule explains choose a Background, a new variant of the partner ability. It means "you may designate two cards as your commander as long one of them is this card and the other is a legendary Background enchantment." This does not combine with any other partner ability, and only creatures with the choose a Background ability allow you to designate a Background enchantment as an additional commander.</p>

<h2>Other rules changes</h2>

<h2>107.3n</h2>

<p>This is a new addition to the list of ways X can be used on a card. One card, Storm King's Thunder, creates a delayed triggered ability that needs to know the X value that was paid for the spell. This rule makes that work.</p>

<h2>111.5</h2>

<p>This is the rule that says if a token can't enter the battlefield, it isn't created. Some added words here cover the case where you would make a token that is a copy of an instant or sorcery card. As you might expect, that token also won't be created.</p>

<h2>112.2a</h2>

<p>If you copy a spell on the stack, rule 112.2 tells you that the owner is the player who put it on the stack. However, many effects instruct a player to create a copy of a card, usually in exile, and then cast the copy. This new subrule explicitly says the owner of that copy is the player who is instructed to create it and given permission to cast it.</p>

<h2>112.4</h2>

<p>This general rule was slightly too broad. It said that if an effect changes any characteristics of a permanent spell, that continues to apply to the permanent the spell becomes. Rule 400.7 limits the scope of that to only certain effects, and this rule is now worded to better reflect that.</p>

<h2>115.9</h2>

<p>Wyll's Reversal is a new card that can only target a spell or ability "with one or more targets." 115.9 was the rule that handled looking for a spell with a single target, so it has been updated slightly to handle looking for any given number of targets.</p>

<h2>400.7a</h2>

<p>This is the rule that explains which effects applying to a permanent spell can continue to apply to the permanent it becomes on the battlefield. A tweak to this rule was missed in the last update, and that led to some confusion over the functionality of Henzie "Toolbox" Torre. Specifically, this change ensures that if you cast a spell with blitz using Henzie's effect, the permanent that spell becomes on the battlefield will continue to have blitz.</p>

<h2>506.6</h2>

<p>Firkraag, Cunning Instigator has a triggered ability that needs to know if a creature in combat "had to attack." This new addition to the combat phase rules defines what that means. Specifically, a creature "had to attack" if one or more effects requiring that creature to attack applied to it at the time that attackers were declared. This doesn't apply to creatures that entered the battlefield attacking because they were never declared as attackers. Note that there are some strange situations where the only legal attacks a player can declare include attacking with a creature that didn't actually have any such effects applying to it. In that case, Firkraag's ability will ignore those creatures.</p>

<h2>601.4</h2>

<p>This new rule expands a bit on how players make decisions while casting a spell. Specifically, the decisions listed in rule 601.2b, including things like choosing a spell's modes, the value of X in its cost, and whether they will pay any additional or alternative costs. Usually, players casting spells make these decisions in the order listed in that rule. For some spells, however, these decisions need to be made in a different order. For example, Inscription of Abundance is a modal spell with kicker and the text "Choose one. If this spell was kicked, choose any number instead." Choosing whether to pay a kicker cost is listed later in rule 601.2b than choosing modes, but for this spell, you need to choose whether to pay the kicker cost first to know how many modes you can choose. In all the discussion about Henzie, (see 400.7a above), we also saw some confusion about how players make choices in this situation. The new 601.4 is there to explicitly clear that up. Specifically for Henzie, you may use the blitz ability that it grants to cast a creature spell with an X in its mana cost if the chosen value for X is high enough to make the creature's mana value 4 or greater.</p>

<h2>607.3</h2>

<p>This is the rule that explains what to do if an object with a linked ability that refers to an exiled card has exiled more than one card. An added sentence explains that if an ability creates a token that is a copy of "the exiled card," and there is more than one exiled, that ability instead creates a token for each of those cards that is a copy of that card. Usually, this situation involves the first part of that ability having exiled a merged or melded permanent that was made up of several component cards.</p>

<h2>608.3</h2>

<p>This rule and its subrules explain how to resolve a permanent spell. Most of the words have changed here, but there isn't really a functional change to speak of. So why update it? Let me explain. Or skip the next paragraph and read the short version. It's up to you.</p>

<p>Up until now, this section stated that there was only one step in the process of resolving a permanent spell: just put the permanent on the battlefield! Easy, right? There was an exception listed for Auras, but that was also easily understood. Then, more recently, we added an exception for copies of permanent spells, then an exception for mutate. There were also a few other exceptions or additions to the process that were kind of hidden throughout the rules. For example, resolving a bestowed Aura with an illegal target is very similar to dealing with the same situation for mutate, but only mutate was mentioned in this section. Bestow felt left out! Some abilities can even cause permanent spells to have other effects as they resolve. All in all, there wasn't really anything <em>wrong</em> with individual rules in the section (or even the ones not in that section), but it was beginning to stack up with the kind of issues that bother the more pedantic humans among us (which I'm not ashamed to say includes me).</p>

<p>In conclusion, we decided to streamline it and make things clearer.</p>

<h2>700.8</h2>

<p>This rule and its subrules explain the party mechanic. One new card, Stick Together, instructs players to "choose a party" from among creatures they control. This is different from previous party effects, which only counted the number of creatures in your party. The section has been reworded and a new subrule added to explain that, to choose a party, each player chooses up to one creature they control for each of the appropriate creature types (Cleric, Rogue, Warrior, and Wizard).</p>

<h2>702.21b</h2>

<p>Minthara, Merciless Soul has "Ward {X}, where X is the number of experience counters you have." A new ward subrule explains that the value of X is determined as the ward ability resolves. It isn't locked in when it triggers. This means that if you get more experience counters between the time it triggers and the time it resolves, your opponent will need to pay that much more mana to keep their spell from being countered.</p>

<h2>702.122d</h2>

<p>The rule for abilities that trigger when a Vehicle "becomes crewed" is expanded slightly to cover intervening "if" clauses that want information about the creatures that crewed it. That clause refers only to creatures that were tapped to pay the cost of the crew ability that caused it to trigger, not creatures that crewed it any other time.</p>

<h2>702.124i</h2>

<p>As we began to add variants of the partner ability to the game that don't use the word "partner," we realized that this would create confusion over what it means to "have partner." We've decided that, if a card refers to another card that has partner, it means only the partner and "partner with" mechanics, and not any other variants of partner.</p>

<h2>702.145</h2>

<p>This is the rule for the daybound keyword ability. As written, it would interact unintuitively in some corner cases involving a Clone entering the battlefield as a copy of daybound creature at night (a weird enough thing on its own). In that case, since the Clone can't enter the battlefield transformed, the rules for double-faced cards prevented the Clone from entering the battlefield at all! The daybound rule has been modified to only apply to permanents represented by transforming double-face cards.</p>

<h2>705.1–2</h2>

<p>These are the rules about flipping a coin. Like the steps for resolving a permanent spell, these have been reordered and streamlined a bit, but the function of these rules is largely unchanged, with one exception. Previously, the rules didn't technically require you to determine who wins or loses a coin flip unless the effect instructing you to flip a coin mentioned a winner or loser. This was a problem for Tavern Scoundrel, which has an ability that doesn't state it needs a winner, but still obviously does. Tavern Scoundrel is now more adequately covered by these rules.</p>

<h2>903.13e</h2>

<p>We used to call this subrule in the Commander Draft section "The Prismatic Piper" rule, as it covered how to use Prismatic Piper as your commander in the draft. I guess now we'll have to start calling it "The Prismatic Piper and Faceless One" rule. It just rolls right off the tongue.</p>

<h2>New Subtypes</h2>

<p><strong>Creature Types</strong></p>

<p>Gith, Walrus</p>

<p><strong>Planeswalker Types</strong></p>

<p>Elminster, Minsc, Tasha</p>

<p><strong>Enchantment Types</strong></p>

<p>Background</p>

<p><strong>Dungeon Types</strong></p>

<p>Undercity</p>

<h2>New Glossary Entries</h2>

<p>Background, choose a Background, initiative, venture into [quality]</p>

I'll begin telling the story of the set's design, introduce the Vision Design team, and show off three cool preview cards. There's a lot to say, so let's get to it.</p>

<h1>A <em>Dominaria United</em> Front</h1>

<p>Before I begin telling the design story, let me introduce you to the <em>Dominaria United</em> (DMU) Vision Design team. I'll be introducing you to the Set Design team next week. As always, I'm having the lead of the Vision Design team, in this case Ethan Fleischer, introduce his team and himself.</p>

	<div>
	<p><strong>Zac Elsik</strong><br />
	Zac is a deck brewer par excellence; perhaps his most famous creation is the Lantern Control deck. During <em>Dominaria United</em> vision design, Zac was a member of the Play Design team. His deep well of experience playing Commander and a variety of competitive formats made him an essential member of the team, as he was able to anticipate play patterns and set power-level targets for cards to help us "find the fun" more quickly.</p>

	<p><strong>Bryan Hawley</strong><br />
	Bryan is a manager of many of the <em>Magic</em> designers, but like every successful member of Studio X, he has a portfolio of skills and responsibilities that is unique to himself. Bryan is not only a leader of designers but also a skilled designer himself, having led several design teams. His experience with crafting and playing Limited formats helped to establish <em>Dominaria United</em>'s structure.</p>

	<p><strong>Ari Nieh</strong><br />
	During <em>Dominaria United</em> vision design, Ari was leading the design effort for <em>The Brothers' War</em>. One of my goals for <em>Dominaria United</em> was for it to set up the following three sets, both creatively and mechanically. Having Ari embedded on the <em>Dominaria United</em> team ensured that we could coordinate our efforts. Though she has since moved on from Wizards, you will see the fruits of Ari's efforts in a few short months!</p>

	<p><strong>James Rose</strong><br />
	James has worked as a game designer on many of our digital games over the years. He's also served on <em>Magic</em> design teams, including <em>Throne of Eldraine</em> and <em>Innistrad: Midnight Hunt</em>, and I have found that he's a very good card designer. I love having him on my design teams because he understands just what kinds of cards the set needs at any given time. I also worked with James designing <em>Dominaria United</em>'s Commander decks.</p>

	<p><strong>Mark Rosewater</strong><br />
	I assume that Mark needs no introduction here! Mark's position as head designer for <em>Magic </em>means that he has an excellent understanding of what the sets before and after <em>Dominaria United</em> were about, which ensured that <em>Dominaria United</em>'s gameplay would be distinctive. Of course, Mark had led the Vision Design team for the 2018 <em>Dominaria</em> set, so he guided the team to ensure that there would be a feeling of continuity between that set and <em>Dominaria United</em>.</p>

	<p><strong>Annie Sardelis</strong><br />
	During <em>Dominaria United</em> vision design, Annie was a member of the Worldbuilding team and served as the first creative lead for <em>Dominaria United</em>. We knew that <em>Dominaria United</em> would have lots of legendary creatures, so Annie and I spent many hours hammering out ideas for characters that would fit the setting and story. Annie has since moved over to my side of the office; she's a senior game designer leading design teams of <em>Magic</em> sets.</p>

	<p><strong>Cameron Williams</strong><br />
	Cameron was an intern, learning about game design from us as part of his college education. I'm a big believer in "learning by doing," so I heaped plenty of responsibilities on Cameron. He rewarded me with lots of fresh, new ideas. He has since finished school, and we've hired him full time as a game designer.</p>

	<p><strong>Ethan Fleischer</strong><br />
	By now, I'm a veteran <em>Magic</em> designer who has led many design teams. I have a special affinity for Dominaria, having led the exploratory design team for <em>Dominaria</em>. I'm also a Dominaria lore expert; I'm pretty sure I've read everything there is to read about the plane. I parlayed that experience into finding the important things to emphasize so that <em>Dominaria United</em> would support our larger story efforts for the Phyrexian arc.</p>

<h1>The History of Dominaria</h1>

<p>Dominaria goes way back to the beginning of <em>Magic</em>. The idea of the Multiverse was there at the game's beginning. Originally, it had a name. It was called Dominia. The center of Dominia was a plane called Dominaria. Having the Multiverse and the central plane being so close in name confused people, so we ended up dropping Dominia as the name and just called it "the Multiverse" instead. (And this was before multiverses were the hot thing in pop culture.) Looking back, I'm surprised we didn't call the Multiverse Dominia and get a new name for the central plane, but all of this was before my time at Wizards.</p>

<p>Anyway, <em>Alpha</em> didn't do a lot to define where it took place, but the general thought was that it was all (or at least mostly) Dominaria. There wasn't really any story, but there were several proper names (places like Llanowar and Benalia and people like Urza and Mishra) that gave the set a feeling of specificity even if it wasn't explained.</p>

<p>The first expansion, <em>Arabian Nights</em>, went somewhere else (although it wasn't named as Rabiah within the set), but the second expansion, <em>Antiquities</em>, returned to Dominaria. <em>Antiquities</em>, for the first time, had a story and started using some of the proper names. Urza wasn't just a guy who liked eyewear but the protagonist in a giant epic story (<em>The Brothers' War</em>, coming soon).</p>

<p><em>Legends</em>, the next set, wasn't located on a single plane, but the following set, <em>The Dark</em>, was. Again, we returned to being solely on Dominaria. Even though the Multiverse existed, <em>Magic</em> stuck around on Dominaria for many years. <em>Fallen Empires</em> and <em>Ice Age</em> were on Dominaria. <em>Homelands</em> was the first set since <em>Arabian Nights</em> to be on another plane (Ulgrotha), but the following set, <em>Alliances</em>, returned us to Dominaria. The whole next "<em>Magic</em> year" (<em>Mirage</em>, <em>Visions</em>, and <em>Weatherlight</em>) were all on Dominaria.</p>

<p>We now get to the point where Michael Ryan and I convinced the company that we should be telling an epic story, the <em>Weatherlight</em> Saga. Part of that, we argued, should include going to other planes, so we pitched a three-year arc where the first two years were on other planes and the third year, the resolution to the story, was back on Dominaria (although in the future, but that version of the story never came to pass).</p>

<p><em>Tempest</em> block (<em>Tempest</em>, <em>Stronghold</em>, and <em>Exodus</em>) was on the plane Rath. Then Michael and I were removed from the story, and the story team returned (mostly) to Dominaria for the next year's block (<em>Urza's Saga</em>, <em>Urza's Legacy</em>, and <em>Urza's Destiny</em>). The following block did hit the second plane Michael and I had pitched (although changed in numerous ways), but only stayed there for one set (<em>Mercadian Masques</em>). <em>Nemesis</em> returned to Rath and <em>Prophecy</em> came back to Dominaria.</p>

<p>The following block (<em>Invasion</em>, <em>Planeshift</em>, and <em>Apocalypse</em>) not only returned to Dominaria but had Rath overlayed on Dominaria, meaning the only plane we'd spent multiple sets on outside of Dominaria was now part of Dominaria.</p>

<p>The next two blocks (<em>Odyssey</em>, <em>Torment</em>, and <em>Judgment</em>, then <em>Onslaught</em>, <em>Legions</em>, and <em>Scourge</em>) stayed on Dominaria, though it went to a whole new continent, Otaria. It wasn't until the following block (<em>Mirrodin</em>, <em>Darksteel</em>, and <em>Fifth Dawn</em>) that we really started embracing the idea that <em>Magic</em> is a multiverse and that we could be introducing a lot of new planes. <em>Magic </em>would return to Dominaria for the <em>Time Spiral</em> block (<em>Time Spiral</em>, <em>Planar Chaos</em>, and <em>Future Sight</em>) and then not return for twelve years.</p>

<p>When we designed original <em>Dominaria</em>, we had a challenge on our hands, because <em>Magic</em> had really changed how we treated planes, and Dominaria was a lot of different worlds all on the same plane. The goal of the design was to give it an identity more concrete than "a hodgepodge of lots of things." In the end, we ended up focusing on the history of the plane, on the fact that both within the game and within the cosmology a lot had happen on Dominaria, and all that history had shaped the plane. As we liked to say, "It's a plane whose present is shaped by its past." Dominaria went on to be a much beloved set, and we said that we were going to want to revisit it at some point.</p>

<p>"Some point" became four years later as we realized that the larger story we wanted to tell really needed a chapter (or rather two chapters) to take place on Dominaria. This meant Ethan and his Vision Design team needed to figure out what the return would look like. The first thing we did was look back at <em>Dominaria</em> to see what we'd done. The overview of the plane had three components:</p>

<p><strong>High fantasy</strong> – Original <em>Magic</em>, including Dominaria, had focused a lot on traditional high fantasy. As <em>Magic</em> had traveled the Multiverse, exploring different kinds of worlds, we'd drifted away from high fantasy to explore a lot of other genres, and mixed genres, of fantasy, so we wanted the return to Dominaria to be a return to the high-fantasy trappings that the game had started with</p>

<p><strong>Rich history</strong> – A lot took place on Dominaria, not just in its history, but within the history of the game. No plane had been the home to more sets, so we wanted to make sure that <em>Dominaria</em> was making reference to its deep past.</p>

<p><strong>Vibrant renewal</strong> – The last we'd seen Dominaria was <em>Time Spiral</em> block, and it was basically post-apocalyptic. The feedback we got from the players was that it was a bit of a downer to see this plane they loved so badly damaged, so we decided in our long absence that the plane had rebounded and we were going to embrace Dominaria being a place of hope rather than despair. Yeah, it had been through a lot, but it always survived and bloomed.</p>

<p>We knew from the start that we wanted to embrace all three of these aspects, as it was the core of what made Dominaria Dominaria. We began by looking back at what<em> Dominaria </em>had done mechanically.</p>

<p><strong>Sagas </strong>– <em>Dominaria </em>was the set that introduced Sagas. We wanted to play up the role of history through stories, and Saga was a new type of enchantment we created to represent that. Since its introduction, Sagas have gone on to become popular and deciduous, so it seemed like a sure thing to have them return.</p>

<p>We were interested, though, in seeing if we could add a little twist to them. We tried several different things, but the most interesting idea was "read ahead" Sagas. The idea behind them was that you didn't have to start with chapter one. Like any story, you could read ahead and start the story further along. This meant you wouldn't get all the effects, but it did allow you to get a later effect sooner. These Sagas were specifically designed to maximize you wanting to do this (although, even normal Sagas tend to grow in power of effect over time). In vision design, we didn't know if we wanted all the Sagas to do this or a single cycle, but Set Design found enough designs that all the Sagas in <em>Dominaria United</em> are read-ahead Sagas.</p>

<p>This brings us to our first preview card. Besides being read ahead, all the Sagas in this set tell a story about something important to the history of Dominaria. The plane had so much story that we had plenty left over from the last batch of Sagas to tell ten more stories. For example, let's hear the story of The World Spell.</p>

<p><strong>Legendary creatures</strong> – Another major theme of <em>Dominaria</em> was playing up all the famous characters from the plane. More so than any other plane, Dominaria is full of characters the audience knows from past sets. Some were the characters as you knew them. Others were ancestors or people carrying on a certain title or mission. The theme was such a big part of the set, every <em>Dominaria </em>booster came with a legendary creature.</p>

<p>Well, if something works, why break it, so <em>Dominaria United</em> continues both the legendary creature theme and the one-legend-per-booster distribution. That brings us to our second preview card showing off a new version of a character from Dominaria's past, Braids.</p>

	<p>Braids first appeared in <em>Odyssey</em> as a member of the Cabal. She would later get an alternate-reality version in <em>Planar Chaos</em>.</p>

	<p>In <em>Dominaria United</em>, we learn that she's still around, although in a slightly different form.</p>

<p><strong>Legendary matters</strong> – A connected theme from having a high number of legendary creatures was also having cards that mechanically care about them. <em>Dominaria </em>had this as a smaller theme, and <em>Dominaria United</em> brings it back.</p>

<p><strong>Multicolor</strong> – Part of capturing the legendary creature theme was allowing ourselves to create legendary creatures that were multiple colors to increase their use in Commander. This theme was popular in <em>Dominaria</em>, and we considered it an extension of the legendary creature theme, so it too returns in <em>Dominaria United</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Throwbacks</strong> – Part of capturing the rich history of the plane is making creative callbacks, but it's equally important to make mechanical callbacks. Characters are part of the game's history, but this is equally true of its cards. <em>Dominaria </em>made a lot of mechanical references to old cards from Dominarian sets. <em>Dominaria United</em> continues this theme. It also brings us to our third and final preview card.</p>

	<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Territorial Maro" src="https://media.wizards.com/2022/dmu/en_sSVBEfo7yf.png" /></p>

	<p>The original Maro showed up in <em>Mirage</em>. [autocard]Multani, Maro-Sorcerer[/autocard] showed up in <em>Urza's Legacy</em>, and [autocard]Molimo, Maro-Sorcerer[/autocard] showed up in <em>Invasion</em>.</p>

	<p class="rtecenter">[card mvid="3397"]Maro[/card][card mvid="12440"]Multani, Maro-Sorcerer[/card][card mvid="23138"]Molimo, Maro-Sorcerer[/card]</p>

	<p>Maro always has variable power and toughness, but the variable changes from card to card. Territorial Maro makes use of domain, a mechanic originally seen, though unnamed at the time, in<em> Invasion</em>. This theme wasn't part of the initial vision design. It got added in set design, which I'll talk about in next week's part of the story.</p>

<p><strong>Historic</strong> – One of the biggest challenges of <em>Dominaria</em> was capturing the history theme. We accomplished this by using what we call batching, where we make a new term that encapsulates several items. Historic took three components, legendary permanents (and spells) that convey characters from the past, artifacts that can represent objects of the past, and Sagas that are stories of the past, and combined them into a single thing that cards could reference.</p>

<p>The original plan for <em>Dominaria United</em> was to bring historic back. The following set <em>The Brothers' War</em> was going to have an artifact theme (like the set that introduced the story, <em>Antiquities</em>), so the thought was that we'd be setting ourselves up for some synergy between the sets. Unfortunately, it turned out to be too much synergy and the worry was that locking in historic cards in <em>Dominaria United</em> would cause set design and play design issues when we were making <em>The Brothers' War</em>, so historic was removed in set design.</p>

<p><strong>Kicker</strong> – This mechanic was the opposite of historic. Vision Design felt we were bringing back enough things from original <em>Dominaria</em> and wanted to make space for something new, so we purposefully left kicker out of the vision design. When historic got removed, they put kicker in to retain enough mechanical connection to <em>Dominaria</em>. More on kicker's inclusion next week.</p>

<p><strong>Legendary spells</strong> – Of all the mechanics in <em>Dominaria</em>, legendary spells were the worst received. They were spells you could only cast if you controlled a legendary creature. The set was already bringing several things back from <em>Dominaria</em>, and we didn't feel legendary spells were needed, so we left them out. We did spend some time talking about whether there was a new way to do them, but in the end decided we'd rather focus our energies elsewhere.</p>

<h1>Returning Home</h1>

<p>This brings us to the end of today's column. As always, I'm eager for any feedback on today's column or any of the elements of <em>Dominaria United</em> I talked about today. You can <a href="mailto:making.magic@hotmail.com">email</a> me or contact me through any of my social media accounts (<a href="https://twitter.com/maro254" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://markrosewater.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Tumblr</a>, <a href="http://instagram.com/mtgmaro" target="_blank">Instagram</a>, and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@markrosewater" target="_blank">TikTok</a>).</p>

<p>Join me next week when I continue the design story picking up with the set design of <em>Dominaria United</em>.</p>

<p>Until then, may you be able to go home again.</p>

Packets Update for Streets of New Capenna</title><link>https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/mtg-arena/jump-in-packets-update-for-streets-of-new-capenna</link><guid>https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/mtg-arena/jump-in-packets-update-for-streets-of-new-capenna</guid><description><![CDATA[<p><em>Streets of New Capenna </em>hits <em>MTG Arena </em>on Thursday, April 28, and that means new <em>Jump In!</em> packets to choose from.</p>

<p>In <em>Jump In!</em>, you select from themed packets to build a ready-to-play deck. There are hundreds of potential combinations, and each packet has some built-in variance, so you never know what to expect next!</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Splash screen for MTG Arena Jump In! showing a lich and a shaman" src="https://media.wizards.com/2021/images/daily/qwZv6RmmJ8Qa.jpg" /></p>

<h1>Event Details</h1>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Starts</strong>: Thursday, April 28, 2022</li>
    <li><strong>Entry</strong>: 1,000 gold or 200 gems</li>
    <li><strong>Format</strong>: <em>Jump In!</em>—pick two packets and play a combined deck with added basic lands.</li>
    <li><strong>Structure</strong>: Play as many games as you wish, resign when you're done. You may pay the entry and rejoin to select new packets and play again.</li>
    <li><strong>Rewards</strong>: First win awards an uncommon individual card reward (ICR), with a 5% upgrade chance to rare or mythic rare.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Where Are the Basic Lands?</h1>

<p>You'll notice that basic lands aren't included in the packet lists. When you play in <em>Jump In!</em> events, you'll automatically receive a mix of basic lands based on the packets you choose, balanced for the costs and activated abilities on the spells in your packets.</p>

<p>Even better, you'll also receive nonbasic lands for play. Packets you choose will add dual lands from <em>Kaldheim</em> in the appropriate colors to your deck.</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Artic Treeline dual land from Magic: The Gathering Kaldheim set" src="https://media.wizards.com/2020/khm/en_PYSTjd5NCU.png" /><img alt="Ice Tunnel dual land from Magic: The Gathering Kaldheim set" src="https://media.wizards.com/2020/khm/en_AV2j1xJ2CD.png" /></p>

<p>If you haven't acquired these lands before, they'll also be added to your collection, and these nonbasic lands are factored in before basic lands are determined for your deck.</p>

<h1>How Packet Selection Works</h1>

<p><em>Jump In!&nbsp;</em>will present you with three options for your first packet. At least one option will be a packet you've never selected in a previous run of the event (unless you've selected them all). There will always be at least one monocolor option and one multicolor option, and no options will have exactly the same color identity as another.</p>

<p>You will also be presented three options for your second packet. The options for the second packet are based on the colors of your first packet selection:</p>

<ul>
    <li>If your first packet selection has one color, there will always be at least one monocolor option and at least one multicolor option. All multicolor options will contain the color of the first packet selection.</li>
    <li>If your first packet selection has two colors, there will always be at least two monocolor options, and at least one of each color. No monocolor option will be outside of the first packet selection's colors. If there is a multicolor option, either its colors will be the same as the first packet selected or it will contain both of those colors plus an additional color.</li>
    <li>If your first packet selection has three colors, there will always be at least two monocolor options, covering at least two of those colors. No monocolor option will be outside of the first packet selection's colors. If there is a multicolor option, it will only contain colors within the first packet selection's color.</li>
</ul>

<h1><em>Jump In!</em> Packet Lists</h1>

<p>Here, you'll find the latest packets and cards that have been added, as well as links to those added from past sets. Each packet list is followed by a table showing the alternate card possibilities. Reading across each row, you'll find the card names and their chance of appearing in that slot in the packet.</p>

<p><strong>Pioneer</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;"><auto-card>Winota, Joiner of Forces</auto-card> is banned.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;"><auto-card>Expressive Iteration</auto-card> is banned.</p>

<p><strong>Explorer</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;"><auto-card>Expressive Iteration</auto-card> is banned.</p>

<p><em>(Note that <auto-card>Winota, Joiner of Forces</auto-card> was already banned in Explorer.)</em></p>

<p><strong>Effective Date</strong>: June 7, 2022</p>

<p>The list of all banned and restricted cards, by format, is <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/gameplay/rules-and-formats/banned-restricted" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<h1>Pioneer</h1>

<p>As noted in previous updates, we want Pioneer to provide as diverse an experience as possible, built out of an ever-growing collection of Standards past.</p>

<p>Over time, it has become clear that Naya Winota is suppressing diversity as its power and consistency have drastically reduced incentives to play other linear creature-based strategies. Not only is it a resilient midrange deck that can leverage many of the powerful mana creatures available in the format, but its explosive draws involving the deck's namesake can create unassailable battlefield states as quickly as turn three.</p>

<p>Due to its large metagame share, high win rate, and ability to create frustrating removal-check gameplay, <auto-card>Winota, Joiner of Forces</auto-card> is banned in Pioneer.</p>

<p><auto-card>Expressive Iteration</auto-card> has been a multiformat all-star since its release in <em>Strixhaven: School of Mages</em>. It has fueled a variety of highly successful Izzet Strategies in Pioneer by both providing card selection and card advantage at a much higher rate than what is available to other decks, making it extremely difficult for other strategies to engage them in wars of attrition.</p>

<p>Although we recognize that there are several other powerful card-draw spells in the format, notably <auto-card>Treasure Cruise</auto-card> and <auto-card>Dig Through Time</auto-card>, we currently believe that delve spells contribute to blue decks in Pioneer having a unique identity among Eternal formats. As Pioneer's card pool has fewer strong cantrips and no fetch lands, we're hoping many delve cards can continue to be a part of the format at a more moderate power level compared to how they would play in other nonrotating formats.</p>

<p>To lower the win rate of the wide variety of Izzet decks and bring them further in line with other strategies in the format while maintaining what makes them special in Pioneer, <auto-card>Expressive Iteration</auto-card> is banned.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that we will continue to align Pioneer ban announcements with action in Explorer. This means that <auto-card>Expressive Iteration</auto-card> will also be banned in Explorer. <auto-card>Winota, Joiner of Forces</auto-card> was previously banned in Explorer. When we made that change, we noted that we would revisit that ban with the release of <em>Dominaria United</em>. However, now that <auto-card>Winota, Joiner of Forces</auto-card> is banned in Pioneer, we plan to leave it banned in Explorer going forward.</p>

<h1>Other Formats</h1>

<p>While we're choosing to make changes only to the Pioneer banned list at this time, we did examine and discuss the health of each of our competitive play formats. For each of those other formats, we found the metagames to be in a generally healthy state, characterized by moderate play rates and win rates among the most played decks, and good variety of choice among competitively viable decks. Below is a short summary of our "no changes" decisions for several formats.</p>

<h2>Standard</h2>

<p>Our data from the platinum and higher <em>MTG Arena</em> ladder shows the Standard metagame as being in a healthy spot. Various three-color mid-speed decks are the most played archetypes, the most popular of which (Esper and Grixis) each occupy about 10% of the ladder metagame. Jeskai variants (featuring either <auto-card>Hinata, Dawn-Crowned</auto-card> or <auto-card>Lier, Disciple of the Drowned</auto-card>) have been growing in popularity at higher levels of play but remain with healthy populations and win rates. Conversely, <auto-card>Runeforge Champion</auto-card> decks and Mono-White Aggro have become less popular over time. Mono-Green Aggro, while not one of the most popular decks, shows promising win rates against many of the more popular archetypes.</p>

<p>All in all, this indicates potential for the metagame to continue evolving, and the current state already reflects good levels of diversity.</p>

<h2>Modern</h2>

<p>The Modern metagame continues to show great playstyle diversity, with aggro, tempo, combo, control, and ramp all represented in the ten most played decks. The most played deck, Izzet Murktide, represents about 10% of the <em>Magic Online</em> metagame and hovers right around a 50% win rate. The top decks show strengths and weaknesses against each other, and there looks to be plenty of room for less popular "rogue" decks to be successful.</p>

<h2>Legacy</h2>

<p>Since the ban of <auto-card>Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer</auto-card> in January, the win rate of Izzet Delver has come down, and the deck now shows appropriate strengths and weaknesses against the other most played archetypes. Reanimator, control, resource denial, combo, and aggro are all additional macro-archetypes that are seeing success. We'll continue to keep an eye out for potentially unhealthy or unfun play patterns, but otherwise natural metagame forces currently look sufficient to handle any short-term shifts in deck popularity.</p>

<h2>Vintage</h2>

<p>As always, data on Vintage tends to come in relatively small sample sizes, but we're not currently seeing anything that indicates changes being necessary. Recent <em>Magic Online</em> Vintage Challenge events show generally good diversity in decks and strategies. New additions from <em>Modern Horizons 2</em> and other recent sets continue to show up, and there appears to be healthy potential for experimentation at the individual card level. As always, we'll continue listening to community feedback.</p>
